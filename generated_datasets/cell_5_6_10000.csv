0,just ordered this one recently and put it on my phone but something weird was afoot,5
1,this allows me to charge other things that don't use micro-usb and most of these are i-phones,5
2,she is pleased with them and now i wish i had bought a dozen for that price and given then as gifts,5
3,in fact we have to hold the power button for a few seconds and it looks brand new again,5
4,size it is not bulky and it has a nice feel to it,5
5,also works well in my car so i don't have to carry my pocketbook with me everywhere,5
6,i bought this as a gift for my wife she just love it so much that i want another one in a different color,5
7,i like that it has a circle in the back to let the apple logo show through,5
8,bottom line is this case does what it's supposed to do and does it with style,5
9,it also has 4 blue led indicators to show you how much power the charging pad has remaining,5
10,would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a slim case that offered some protection for the phone,5
11,it even has a built in screen protector which is great,5
12,mounting position was very important in order for the person on the other end doesn't even realize i am using a headset,5
13,bottom line is you can't go wrong with this product and the customer service is also good,5
14,i should start by saying i haven't dropped my phone with the case on but the original charger that comes with your phone,5
15,this was my first case by elago and i must admit that i was wrong this thing is pretty heavy way heavier than i expected,5
16,the only difference is that it did not come with a carrying bag as advertised,5
17,it fits my phone perfectly and it is exactly what i was looking for in this cable,5
18,everything works great and the batteries last just as long as the factory one did when new,5
19,that's pretty much all i have to say about this case man i love it,5
20,because i am more likely to use it to listen to her music on her ipod,5
21,yes it helps it to be on the same side as the power button but that's not a big deal,5
22,along with a tempered glass screen protector this is very beautiful,5
23,i especially appreciate that the case goes in and out of my pocket with ease w o collecting lint,5
24,love the case it's simple and easy to use and has a nice look to it and is an excellent quality product,5
25,it even comes with a dash adhesive if you want to mount it semi permanent in your car,5
26,i contacted skinomi and they sent me a new one free of charge that works well,5
27,by the time they got ready it had been about an hour and a half of wearing them they still felt great,5
28,so when it came to buying a case for my note 3 and i didn't wanted to buy a 3rd party accesory,5
29,overall this is a great product from a company that continues to be one of my favorite cases,5
30,to start charging your iphone you have to hold the power button on the back of the battery no lights it's not charging,5
31,it is very easy to take the phone out of the skin,5
32,and it is small enough to easily fit in your pocket back to back with your phone usually,5
33,a nice velvet pouch contains everything and there is a nice set of adapters that also comes with a fabric storage pouch,5
34,it is a little large to carry in a pocket so i was looking for something portable and easy for him to carry with him,5
35,i like the plain black case that stays on your phone when the battery is dead but it charges at a slow rate,5
36,it works and that is about all i can say about it the delivery was very fast,5
37,this dual purpose stylus works great you can use it as a little flashlight if you don't have enough room to plug it in,5
38,the jabra jx10 is amazingly small and most people can't even tell i have a protector on the phone,5
39,overall am i extremely happy with this device and would recommend this to friends and familythanks,5
40,it is smaller than some of the other cases the quality and finish of this case is really exceptional for the money,5
41,i 8217ve been using it for a few weeks now and am simply amazed at how much it can do,5
42,it adds minimal if any bulk and weight to the phone but the battery life nearly doubled,5
43,i put a small round metal disc about the size of a quarter and i easily slide the pick under the glass,5
44,i waited for the otterbox commuter and didn't like it so i gave it to my daughter to use,5
45,the rated charge in this device is legit and i can easily get a day out of a charge now,5
46,i've also fumbled my phone a few times now and the case has held up and hasnt fallen off like other cheap cases,5
47,we go overnight fishing and it is nice to know that the phone isn't going to die,5
48,update i've had this phone for about 2 months and it hasn't scratched or scuffed much,5
49,the case provides overall protection if you were to drop the phone in the water but that's always problematic,5
50,with a normal use the battery will last a full day of heavy use without running out of battery,5
51,it holds the phone tight so i don't have to worry that it won't reach the counter,5
52,it came in a 3 pack but i doubt if i will ever get tired of this cover,5
53,what can i say it has a simple job to do and it does it well and for a very fair price,5
54,she uses it daily and has nothing but good things to say about them for the price usually less than 110,5
55,a small slit glows yellow on the front of the unit and 2 on each side,5
56,great for a phone that wont be near a wall socket i bring it with me,5
57,bluetooth earpieces allow hands free talking or listening to music on a long flight draining the battery,5
58,but the phone was so pretty that i didn't want to pay a lot for them,5
59,i have been wearing it for 3 days now and so far so good,5
60,i got the black one and it looks great on my phone i love the button's too,5
61,charging is simple using a standard micro usb cable to charge your headset from any pc or external battery or wall charger,5
62,it works it's a little pricey but it's well worth the trade-off,5
63,i would extremely recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect thier investment,5
64,my wife has had the galaxy s3 version of this case for a year and has held up after numerous drops,5
65,it works really well and it really protects the phone and makes it feel safe,5
66,i can't wait to put it on my phone yet and the price that i paid was worse it,5
67,didn't think i would use the kickstand but have found it to be very convenient much more than i had expected,5
68,the metallic area around the camera window on the back is a bit ridiculous although some younger people may like it,5
69,definitely recommended if you don't have to carry it around,5
70,i've had this same case for my s3 and loved it as i love this one,5
71,the case fits well for the gsm version of the galaxy nexus and the case fits perfectly,5
72,i can confirm that these batteries last just as long as the stock battery and came fully pre-charged,5
73,i give them tons of credit because this is the first android phone that can challenge the iphone for best looking phone,5
74,super thin yet adds protection to the phone all the way around and in the front so you can place your phone many places,5
75,here is the beauty of this device i keep the phone in my pocket and don't see any scratches or peeling,5
76,i love the ability to retract the cable when it is not being used so that's a big plus,5
77,i consider myself a power-user as i am always on my phone the battery life is very short,5
78,which means that you will not have to worry about her phone ever running out of juice,5
79,price is great works great i can go all day and probably some of the next day,5
80,the ismooth 4 ft apple 30-pin cable is a very high quality cable that works well and is well made,5
81,right now i am charging an ipod an iphone and a backup battery charger all at once,5
82,i've dropped my phone a couple of times but the case protected it,5
83,its really cute and does protect my phone i like that i can use the usb cord as well on my laptop,5
84,if you like me buy two one for home and one for work this is a cost effective solution,5
85,figure out your method and make sure you don't bust the ribbon cables,5
86,they are very simple to use usually you just connect the device you want to charge if it is not a subminiature connector,5
87,would recommend very easy to put on and you cant even tell its on my iphone 5s,5
88,these are the best screen protector's i've used and i've tried many and still come back to it,5
89,and as i said before after a while you 8217ll get used to just tapping the screen until the phone responds,5
90,i can't wait to see how many charges i can get from my galaxy tab2,5
91,now that it is out i am enjoying this case so much that i ordered more for the other iphones in the house,5
92,i did test the dual output options and was able to simultaneously charge my kindle my android phone and a portable stereo speaker,5
93,overall you can't go wrong if you don't like it for whatever weirded out reason just return it,5
94,i've been using them for about two weeks now and it's held up very well too,5
95,i have had no troubles with this product and would recommend this to anybody looking for comfortand security if you are down with those,5
96,just recieved my case 2 days before it was supposed to and was packaged very professionally,5
97,people i spoke with had no clue i had a case on my phone and it fits well inside the case,5
98,i've been using the otterbox commuter for a couple months now and this is my honest viewpoint of this product,5
99,this case is a great protector without adding a lot of bulk and unsightly decorations to your phone,5
100,a few times now i have set the phone on the pad and within minutes the phone is fully charged,5
101,it is not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for and i don't like buying something twice,5
102,for a mid grade shock drop resistant case one of the best i've seen on any phone or point-and-shoot camera,5
103,it doesn't interfere with the use of the buttons on the phone but with a cover the button is not activated,5
104,it's not a deal breaker just be prepared to give it a bit of protection if it ever got dropped,5
105,my cousin has this phone she bought it about a year ago and it wore out just like the factory battery,5
106,this is very handy so that i don't have to carry my phone a wallet,5
107,so far has lasted for a long time and was very durable for the price i paid for two you get one on amazon,5
108,update 6 28 2014since using this case for a month and a half now,5
109,nice part it will charge a tablet and a phone at the same time while we travel,5
110,this was intended as a stop gap case because it was cheap and had good reviews so i thought i would help at t folks,5
111,fits the screen perfectly and can't even tell i have a screen protector on my phone's screen,5
112,this is completely out of jabra's control and this is a very well engineered screen protector that made me happy,5
113,i've tried several iphone covers and this is by far my favorite phone case i have yet,5
114,be h6 aboji-gythe material has a great matte finish and feels solid and well-built,5
115,i got this for my wifes ipod and i got another one for my wife and i got the black one,5
116,i bought these for backup since my son and i have the same phone so i needed something to tell them apart,5
117,i also charged my note 3 and my wife's is and 4s iphone,5
118,superior in every way and did i mention it's also comparatively inexpensive to buy and use,5
119,it makes the phone a little bulkier so you don't have the rubber cases getting stiff and old in a box,5
120,i usually get otterboxes or tridents but didn't want to make too many compromises in favor of cost,5
121,i have also used it to charge my ipad and iphone over night at hotels and trade shows,5
122,very happy with this as a back-up for plane rides and such,5
123,somehow i found this product and i am glad to have it in my flight bag,5
124,my only suggestion for the improvement of this product would be to allow you to keep your phone fully charged at all times,5
125,it takes a while to charge probably about 8 hours for a full charge had i used a 1a charger,5
126,went from a billfold case to this one and i must say that it's an attractive case for the phone,5
127,i am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone that asks me about them,5
128,i discover that i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices is increasingly becoming a major hassle,5
129,it sounded better than my laptop speakers so it's a good way to get another 5 cord and it works pretty well,5
130,for the price and size of the unit i have yet to see a qi charger that has a vertical design,5
131,i never had any issues with otterbox defender cases it really protects your phone i'm gon na order in black next,5
132,after charging and holding down the power button to turn on and a double press to turn off,5
133,my one issue with the case is that when i put it a holster it starts getting hot,5
134,i am so pleased with my purchase and i will recommend this to a friend,5
135,i've installed many screen protectors over the years and this one is another great product,5
136,in case you are having a real emergency it also has a built in fm radio which self tunes to the stations worked a treat,5
137,i have used other clear covers before and this is by far my favorite case of them all for my galaxy note ii,5
138,it protects my phone perfectly and it doesn't make my phone look bulky it still has its slim look,5
139,i have about 8 phone cases and i have to say i was nicely surprised when i received it,5
140,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great all-around case,5
141,in fact you won't hardly notice that there is a screen protector on my phone and the screen still looks great,5
142,just avoid the qcell if you plan on using the phone while it is charging even if they are in the back seat,5
143,i put this on my iphone 4 and it fits it very well,5
144,it's well built thin nice looking and doesn't add a ton of bulk to the phone which is very slippery without a case,5
145,4 hours to go from 10 % to 100 % 1440mah in 2 hours 30 minutes ends with 3 led lights on3,5
146,now i can charge my iphone and my ipad at the same time since i started using it so i can't speak to that,5
147,it works really well and it really protects the phone and it looks pretty good too,5
148,the mpow charger has a blue light to show that there is power coming through,5
149,the top of the phone is a little harder to depress but not overly difficult,5
150,i have also used it to charge my wife's ipad and my friend's android,5
151,i have had them for over 6 months and i can not complain about it not being big enough lol,5
152,installation it was very easy to install and is very durable,5
153,i accidentally broke the little kick stand the first day i got it 2 little tiny pearls fell of but,5
154,it fits well is easy to put on and take off,5
155,this will last as long as the screen protector is properly installed,5
156,the clip seems to stay on pretty securely and it appears to be a great protector for the full glass face of the watch,5
157,nothing bad to say especially for the price i'm still pretty satisfied with the protection,5
158,i don't know why they give you 3 but hey it's a good option to have if you really need it,5
159,ive had this for a while now and it doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all,5
160,the charger is light and small easy to carry in your purse or pocket while you're out clubbing,5
161,if any problems show up in the future i will update this review and let you guys nkow more,5
162,i bought a mk one for my iphone 4 and 5 on both mine and my wife's phones use that,5
163,it's a little tricky getting it in and out of my pocket but not so much to be annoying,5
164,the only thing i don 8217 t like about this charger is that the usb cord is attached to the base,5
165,the power bank is heavy and a bit larger than a deck of cards and it's got a impressive power capacity,5
166,this is by far the best case i've bought for my galaxy s4,5
167,otterbox defender series case and holster for samsung galaxy s4 retail packaging fits my new samsung galaxy s4 perfectly,5
168,the headset is very easy to wear for long periods of time than this but i found it to be extremely fast and very useful,5
169,i've had this july this year and let me tell you it surely does serve its purpose,5
170,i have owned several bluetooth headsets this is by far the best backup battery that i have,5
171,not sure if that turns out to be a good thing,5
172,it's durable holster securely holds my phone and the kickstand is just a bonus for the case it is not cheap,5
173,tech armor in my opinion make the best screen protectors out there so i absolutely recommend it,5
174,the suction cup is the best i've ever used for a cell phone,5
175,i wanted a battery pack for my phone because i don't any bloatware from t-mobile or att etc,5
176,bought this so i could carry it in my bag and i can charge my phone from 20 % to 65 %,5
177,i like how you can mix and match if you have more than one device to charge like phone and bluetooth,5
178,i like that it doesn't look like a cheap product,5
179,also it is much cheaper and i am happy with this product and good material it is made with,5
180,it seems to be very durable and it is extremely easy to put on and take apart,5
181,by this i mean that i am able to use the little stand when i need to,5
182,i adjusted it to fit my phone and all i have to do it pull out the phone,5
183,a nice velvet pouch contains everything and there is a nice set of adapters that also comes with a fabric storage pouch,5
184,it takes a lot longer to charge my phone but i don't mind because it feels a bit more well made,5
185,it is very practical and holds so much and like the fact that i can throw it in a purse glove box gym bag etc,5
186,i just wanted a case that provides a lay-on-the-table-design lip but it's very minimal,5
187,love the purple the only thing that sucks is it makes the back of the iphone 5 has two off sets,5
188,first of all i have so many of these cases and i love each and every one of these cases,5
189,it is exactly as described and it does exactly what it is supposed to do it fights a little against the protective shield,5
190,i emailed the seller and they sent me a replacement right away with no questions asked,5
191,it looks so simple clean buuuut make sure you wash your hands and clean the screen good,5
192,galaxy's are made to take a drop so we don't have to fight over who gets to charge their phone in the car,5
193,i forgot about this screen protector about a day after i put it on i was amazed at the quality of the film,5
194,i've got tech armor matte screen protectors on every one of my devices i feel they are the best to use,5
195,it could charge both my husband and my phones as well as my kindle fire hd at the same time was liberating,5
196,i own this same phone for over a year now and i recommended them to everyone,5
197,if something were to happen to mine i'm pretty sure i'd have to get a new phone even tho mine's not old,5
198,i had many bluetooth devices and this by far has been the best i've found so far for my needs,5
199,this is an awesome little device and i would recommend it to anyone with a 4 or 4s model,5
200,i was reluctant to buy this one because i wasn't sure i'd even keep it,5
201,there is really nothing about the battery pack that i don't mind carrying it with me,5
202,came with various sized ear covers so it doesn't have to be an exact fit to still work well,5
203,i love the retro look and i definitely recommend this case for someone looking to buy it,5
204,maxboost pro premium composite bought this one for my son-in-laws phone,5
205,the phone is held securely and you don't have to worry about this one getting tangled up in my tech drawer,5
206,this one has been my favorite case so far and sadly i've been through a lot of bluetooth earpieces,5
207,this charger is one of the best i've seen on a pouch in a long time,5
208,when you need extra power this is my go to case manufacturer when ever i switch phones,5
209,the truth is this product did not stand the test of time and i would buy a new one if it failed today,5
210,also the bumper has just enough of a lip on the front to prevent scratching or contacting directly on surface,5
211,15 applied increased my rating to 5 stars from 3 stars because device works as advertised,5
212,the charger connected to a power outlet takes a couple of hours to charge from less than 20 % to above 80 %,5
213,i've tested this lightning cable with an ipad and an iphone you can charge both simultaneously,5
214,i've been using an otterbox commuter case and it does not interfere with glasses and stays balanced,5
215,i also like the fact that you get so many for a good price,5
216,this cell phone holder was well worth the money and i will get more of them,5
217,this one looks like it's going to be a bit bulky,5
218,overall i'd say this is the perfect case for a perfect case,5
219,there's also a conventional usb outlet at the end of the power strip covering up two outlets or anything like that,5
220,result is that everything charges perfectly and i am able to dock it without taking off case,5
221,so far they have had no problems charging two devices at the same time i think it deserves its five stars,5
222,everything it describes is in fact true they fit perfectly on my iphone 4 and went on with minimal bubbles,5
223,i haven't tried plugging in more than one device at a time while not using 2 outlets,5
224,i feel confident that if i drop the phone it will be ok,5
225,the htc hub and photo enhancer are much more useful than the single output adapter we had been using,5
226,5 mm headphones has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to clothing or whatever when not in use,5
227,i've had my t610 for about 3 months now and i used it everyday without a hitch,5
228,no finger prints are ever on the screen and you can still see the beauty of the htc one show on the surface and ends,5
229,it's more precisely fit and easier to install remove than the one for the s2,5
230,for the price i think this is one of the best i've used,5
231,i took a few photos with it and i was very impressed with the rate at which the pack charged my verizon lgg2,5
232,not sure why so many bad reviews i've never had a problem using these with my phone,5
233,the phone was nice and clean and it was easy to put on and even came with a cleaning cloth,5
234,i had this case for about 6 months and it has held up well in day to day use,5
235,everything seemed to charge just as fast as the wall chargers at home,5
236,i got this bundle of ten cases because it was a good deal i got several in the pack but only needed one,5
237,of course the front is not protected or you would not be able to get one to fit the note 3,5
238,the sound quality has been very good and i 8217ve been able to charge my iphone ipad and wireless headphones,5
239,i'm impressed and so far can't find anything negative to say about this case its perfect for my lg,5
240,if you're like me you've been looking for a long time for a car charger that would actually output the maximum 1,5
241,it's small enough to carry in hand if you need to use your device when it is charging on the unit,5
242,i would extremely recommend this product to anyone who was looking for samsung captivate galaxys phone these work great,5
243,i feel comfortable holding the phone and don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans,5
244,it protects the phone screen in her purse and also doubles as a kick stand for watching you tube videos or tv,5
245,now onto this power bank in the package you'll find a charging block and a 30-pin cable,5
246,i love the band simply because it stays where i put it and i can easily put it in my pockets,5
247,highly recommended for those that require charging a lot of usb powered devices then this is your solution,5
248,took a while to get but i'm satisfied with the quality of the product ant the multiple charges it give my phone,5
249,i have bought 4 other cases for my note 3 and this is the best one,5
250,this really goes perfectly with a pair of bluetooth headphones the connection stays strong,5
251,many people don't even know i have a case on my phone so the slot is a bit big for the phone,5
252,fits very well took about a month to get to me other than that it is a decent mount,5
253,three usb ports i use it to charge my iphone when i'm stuck in class without a power outlet,5
254,it pairs easily with my ipad and the sound quality is good enough to keep me peddling and lifting,5
255,only had it a few weeks so i don't know how to set it up and use it at first she really enjoys it,5
256,it is after all a battery it's not bad at all for a 4 g phone with verizon wireless,5
257,very few things seem to work right out of the box or break after a few uses,5
258,i'm in the marketing digital design field so i use my phone a lot so it's battery is near death a lot,5
259,it's a snug fit but it's a lot easier to carry these around without worrying about a cord tangling,5
260,it is bright and friendly and i love it i would recomend it and it fits very nicely,5
261,i ran a stock battery for the first couple of days to ensure the best battery life,5
262,usb insertion is easy and you don 8217 t have to worry about running out of battery before i charge up at night,5
263,i tested the cable by connecting my kindle fire to a usb port on my laptop and it works great for both,5
264,they absolutely love the phone and say it is very easy to use and operate and overall vey intuitively designed,5
265,my only complaint is that this case is very stiff so it's a bit difficult to take photos in bright light,5
266,this charger will come in handy on a trip when i needed to charge an ipad and something else you will appreciate having that ability,5
267,i suspect this will loosen the more i use the phone the more i like it,5
268,what i especially liked about it is the fact that there is a laser pointer as well as the led flashlight,5
269,i bought this for my boyfriend and it is still in perfect condition thanks to the otter box,5
270,in my case it's a perfect travel companion for charging both my phone and tablet either in the hotel or in the car,5
271,that was a very frustrating experience as it took a while to get to me but i'm very happy,5
272,this has i be my most favorite iphone case i love it so much i want to buy another one,5
273,this is my first casecrown and it is just as good if not better than the more expensive ones as well,5
274,the downside is that it is not compatible with this phone,5
275,in fact if i get any more i'm pretty sure i'll have one of these for every phone and tablet in the house,5
276,and i can say that i would buy this product again and suggest it to my friends,5
277,it charges quickly usable within a half hour or so and mine was ready to go,5
278,it can be a little tedious to take it on and off my phone if i need to,5
279,the color is great and it is very easy to use on my ipad and iphone,5
280,it doesn't get in the way of the other cord,5
281,they call it satin which means it has a matte finish so it does wash out the colors barely noticeable,5
282,1 will give your device a charge while you continue to use it or slide it back into your pocket,5
283,they are more flexible than the round cables that came with my iphone and ipad when i'm on the road,5
284,the inbuilt voice tells you when it is turned on or off how much battery is left5,5
285,i charged my bluetooth headphones my iphone and my kindle fire both more than once from this charger,5
286,it is great to be able to pull this out of my purse and charge my phone when i need to,5
287,after just two weeks of use i don't know how i ever held on to my phone without this case,5
288,i have even managed to get two full charges for my iphone 4s out of the device,5
289,the plastic is durable and it fits my samsung galaxy s4 perfectly and was easy to put on my phone and i love it,5
290,i would highly recommend this product if you use your device a lot,5
291,i had been using the motorola h710 for the last couple of years with the only real difference being the type design,5
292,5 yrs since i had my iphone 4 and this one is by far the best of them all,5
293,short sweet review i've had my s4 for about 2 weeks now and though i haven't had to use the glue,5
294,it has a firm grip on the iphone as well as podcasts straight from the websites,5
295,i can honestly say that this has held up better than any case he has had for the past ten years,5
296,i think for the price of this case you can't ask for a better way to carry the massive note 3,5
297,i got ta say that this is the best phone i've ever owned,5
298,after buying this i bought one for my dad and i would recommend this product hands down to everyone,5
299,since it's oblong it doesn't take up much space on my nightstand when not in use,5
300,and best part if you have any problems they have great customer service and made sure the customer was satisfied,5
301,i also have to say that the noise reduction is not as good as my finger i can swype one handed using my thumb,5
302,i had originally gotten this item for my new phone but when i found it in purple omg i am ecstatic,5
303,i just hope the tech stays so i can use this on my office line at home as well,5
304,the case is exactly the right length and width for the note 2 and the only one i am completely happy with,5
305,but not my s3 sold it to a co-worker and she loves it to death,5
306,it's a great feeling knowing i dont have to be worried about my charger and where to plug in at,5
307,i wanted something for my galaxy s4 and decided to get this one as well and it's becoming an incredibly useful feature,5
308,dropped my phone on the same day i put this on it and it becomes a rugged looking fun toy,5
309,plus they don't add much bulk to the phone but it actually allows you to enjoy your evo once again,5
310,i'd recommend this seller to everyone and i look forward to buying more in the near future,5
311,the battery weighs a little sure but after a day or two it settles down and you can hardly see it,5
312,it's nice and thin and doesn't add too much thickness to the phone and slides into my back pocket nicely,5
313,love this case it has some rugged to it so it doesn't pick up fingerprints and stays pretty clean,5
314,would recommend it to anyone looking for a charger with high output,5
315,i have no complaints about this one except that there is no hard plastic or candyshell to it,5
316,this was a great buy on a 3 pack of screen protectors for my gf's phone for under 2,5
317,the cut out to the case is a perfect fit and relatively easy to install,5
318,car charger usb charger and an ac charger for a very reasonable price far exceeding generic quality cheapo units,5
319,it can hold a long charge however i wish it had a little more material in the front for better protection,5
320,it's sturdy durable and i love that you can charge two devices at the same time,5
321,peel and stick application no cutting required does not interfere with touch screen and touch sensitivity on the device,5
322,this phone literally blew me away and i will continue to use only blackberry products for my blackberry phone,5
323,i'm a very picky consumer but i really can't think of a scenario where i'd use this,5
324,i charged it up in the morning and has been using it for over a week and everything is still intact,5
325,i really like the fact that it has a place to clip the included stylus too,5
326,special note i actually received this about a month and a half of use mine are still going strong,5
327,it appears to be made well and i am sure it will stay as bestseller for a long time,5
328,the only things i didn't like about this case was that the color does not match what is displayed online,5
329,another really nice feature of the charger is that not only does it have a wonderful modern look the hard case really protects it,5
330,it's a very tight fit and i actually had to use some force to get it off the window,5
331,this will do exactly what you need it to do which is to allow me to charge two devices simultaneously,5
332,i recommend this product 100 % its been over a month and i've had consistent performance from it in our area,5
333,i've dropped the phone from a table with this on and no damage not that i recommend dropping your phone,5
334,after a year of use i can honestly say this is the best money i've spent,5
335,this was the easiest screen protector i have ever put on my phone and i am looking for more like it lol,5
336,however given how cheap they are i think it's a great success plus my thunderbolt has a much needed backup,5
337,it's the best screen protector i have ever bought in the past,5
338,the k-ble ultra series 10 ft usb data sync and charge cable worked great when charging her ipod,5
339,however i am really surprised at how much i like this case even upon just first glance,5
340,i will be upgrading soon so i don't want to make it bigger with a wide case,5
341,update 2 i contacted the seller and they were kind enough to help me and supplied me with another protector,5
342,these wrap around your neck or for me go under the collar of my shirt keeping almost the whole unit hidden,5
343,i bought two of these one for my phone and one for my wife's gs3 purple and we couldn't be happier,5
344,my research came up with few stand and for the price of this one that's what i was expecting,5
345,it fits in my pants pocket and i really like the matte look of the pink,5
346,hi i bought this for a friend and she loves it on her galaxy s4,5
347,with this cable plug set up i no longer have to take my gloves off every time,5
348,charging the case and phone at the same time with only 1 charger,5
349,i had a belkin cover on my iphone 4s and it worked just great,5
350,for the next four charge cycles you should let the battery drain to 0 and then charge it using the wall charger,5
351,there is a slight lip around the front of the phone so you can insert the microscope easily,5
352,i highly recommend this case if your looking to protect your galaxys iii then this is it,5
353,use a second piece of tape to remove the dust from the protector don't bend the corners up too much,5
354,the higher powered one can be used to charge a variety of different models,5
355,cell phone cases can be a bit tricky to get right to the edge of the touch screen by accident,5
356,i have only used it for a week but so far it's done it's job,5
357,i couldn't be happier with this product and it was exactly as described and very pretty and functions well,5
358,i love the colors and the fact that it has a matte finish instead of a high gloss,5
359,it makes the phone bigger but it's a case for a s3 galaxy and it's slate,5
360,this brightly colored protective case is made of a very flexible rubberized plastic,5
361,i have to admit it's definitely a step up from the powergen in a lot of ways,5
362,it stays on securely and you are able to still use the touch screen with the phone in there which is a plus,5
363,haven't used the screen protector yet so i'm not sure how durable it is but i think it could stand a drop,5
364,we got this for our daughter and it has proven to be much better than the one the phone came with,5
365,i think the light really adds a sleek look to it and blends well with the black of his phone,5
366,if you're going to get some sort of case to put the phone in the case it came out almost immediately,5
367,i use this for running and have had it for several months and it has not cracked or split,5
368,it fully charged a 10 8217 tablet and a phone at the same time for those really long airplane flights,5
369,i haven't yet dropped the phone from a height of 48 inches on each face corner and back,5
370,i love this product and purchased a second one for my wife and so far we are satisfied,5
371,it is especially nice for travel when i want to take my phone out of it's otterbox case,5
372,it feels good in the hand and it makes the phone easier to pick up and handle,5
373,i wasn't getting the 3 g status so i called t-mobile and had this sim card activated in 5 minutes,5
374,it doubles your battery power and now you can also charge the battery in the phone at the same time,5
375,of course it was a while for it to come in the mail so that i can use it in the car stereo as well,5
376,it works well and the color is just what i wanted and arrived quickly in the mail,5
377,it fits on easily and is easy to take off and put on very often,5
378,i always need the extra batteries thanks i use the battery all the time maybe once or twice a week,5
379,there is a lip along the edge so the phone can be placed face down but not if you have spigen's glas,5
380,the build of this case is very high quality it's made of a heavy metal alloy,5
381,i wanted a case that seemed to offer a good amount of protection while still being fairly slim,5
382,i forgot about this screen protector about a day after i put it on i forget the screen protector is even there,5
383,after thinking about it for a few days i'm on the phone all the time and someone that isn't clumsy with their devices,5
384,with this case my phone is protected and i don't have any problems at all with the new toy,5
385,another nicety is the color changing indicator to let you know roughly how much battery was left about 20 %,5
386,customer service sucks but when you get it going it does what its supposed to and only costs a couple of bucks,5
387,it's genius how you can use it as a little flashlight if you don't have enough room to plug it in,5
388,it will take me from 10 % to 100 % in less than 2 hours using the 2a port,5
389,it fits in my 2000 toyota camry but i have not tried it so i can not draw a comparison,5
390,bought for my wife she is very happy with it great fit and finish,5
391,i did not realize this bundle came with a screen protector that fit on with no issues,5
392,0a 8221 has a max output of 1 amp while is great for any non-tablet device,5
393,it literally only took me one try to put on a screen protector without trapping any dust underneath,5
394,i use the little insert most of the time but i am still happy i got this,5
395,very happy with the product and i highly recommend this to all galaxy s4 owners,5
396,this cd mount is a great way to keep it clean,5
397,i got so many compliments on this case when i go out for meeting friends and dinner,5
398,the additional time between it and the factory battery that comes with the phone but it's perfectly fine with me,5
399,the product is very well made and is holding up great,5
400,i have bought a few cheaper ones in the past and this is better than all of them,5
401,this is a must have for anyone who wants to protect their note and make it look cool,5
402,i have not yet used them for more than a couple of minutes when really traveling to get away,5
403,this is a very nice case for a samsung fascinate and is one of the best values i have seen in this category,5
404,although there are two usb ports the ipad will only charge at full speed if it is the only device connected,5
405,the price was awesome and was delivered in a great amount of time and the price was great and i am so happy,5
406,their regular microfiber stylus holds up for a long time keeps it's shine,5
407,i get a phone that looks good works good i want to show it off without risking it by dropping it,5
408,i currently have one an amazon one in my car and have this smaller one in my computer bag,5
409,the buttons power and volume don't protrude enough to make it easy to hold as well as out of your way,5
410,it has a smooth finish and is compact enough to fit into the front pocket of my jeans to not be bulky and unbearable,5
411,after leaving a review here on amazon i was contacted by anker's customer service and a new set was shipped out immediately,5
412,it's nice and light and doesn't make the phone look bulky and are much expensive,5
413,only thing that bothers me is that after a while it stared to fade and peel a little,5
414,the top cover part will fold all the way around the phone without leaving any sharp edges at all,5
415,while you can attach this to your computer via usb and charge it that way if necessary,5
416,as for the anti-glare it's hard to tell if they are oem or third party,5
417,it came exactly as described with a stylus and screen protector i set those items aside as backup,5
418,you can use these several hours a day for several days and still have half my battery on it,5
419,it took a bit of time to get here but i get alot of compliments on that case as well,5
420,i love that you can see the back of the phone while it protects the phone in style,5
421,-i have purchased these in the past and dropped my phone several times when a call comes in when i'm sleeping,5
422,i bought this case to use with my samsung galaxy s3 and mymediabridge usb 2,5
423,the carrying case is a welcome extra if for no other reason than to add it to your android arsenal,5
424,the quality of this is similar but this is not a deal breaker the oem cord works well,5
425,this means that you'll be able to use this as a hands free speaker,5
426,i have had this product for about a month now and item seems very sturdy,5
427,especially considering the price this is a great addition to our android smartphone experience,5
428,it is oem quality and is able to charge my iphone ipad and cameras,5
429,my car only has one lighter jack in the front so it's not completely flush with the phone,5
430,the case has a good feel to it and is not to bulky,5
431,it is very small and thin which adds no weight to the phone at all for 10 dollars this is a nice looking case,5
432,it is a great option for charging your phone when you don't feel the need to have this one in a case,5
433,my 2 yr old son broke mys pen that came with my device that i had lost,5
434,i've owned several different bluetooth headsets over the years and they were either damaged or lost,5
435,cant complain works great and for the money you won't get a better product,5
436,it has a minimal lip that covers the edges of the phone so the glass remains exposed and vulnerable,5
437,everything is in the right place and the volume and power buttons work just fine,5
438,uag case and the element eclipse case are arguably the best cases on the market low profile great feel and amazing looks,5
439,a car charger is a must for anyone who uses their phone much for anything,5
440,it will come off the phone fairly easily but i wouldn't want to think about the chance it would slip out,5
441,and of course we are able to charge two items at the same time freeing up that extra wall plug for something else,5
442,another great feature is that it comes with its own power cord so you don't have to worry about the two pieces becoming separated,5
443,the standard web browser is getting a bit long in the tooth compared to android and ios,5
444,i knew right away this speaker would be the perfect gift for my son who goes on fishing camping trips,5
445,i have had it for 3 months now and it has saved me a lot of money,5
446,since it's oblong it doesn't take up much space in the glove box or in your bag,5
447,in fact this phone is almost the same size as my nexus 5 phone slightly thicker,5
448,if it's angled it's going to have a hard time stopping dad from borrowing them,5
449,the only drawback to this case is that it does a good job of eliminating background noise,5
450,my recommendation would be to buy this if you can get it at a lower cost and serve the same purpose,5
451,with this charger i can charge them both at the same time and both phones were charging without any issues,5
452,charging my phone was extremely fast and it is just as fast with the protective case on the phone as off,5
453,i recommend if you're looking for a great case with a great look and gives an attitude of professionalism when used,5
454,this is the only issue i have with it is that i have to provide my own usb cord s,5
455,if you have been looking for a case that would protect my phone even better and i also wanted a holster,5
456,the capacity is enough to charge my nexus 4 phone around 3 times before i had to recharge the boost battery,5
457,i can take the battery pack with me and not have to leave it in my car to charge my iphone5,5
458,this product allows you to charge up to 2 devices at the same time if needed,5
459,it fits my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with this cord,5
460,it's a hard plastic not as rubbery as the original one that came in the box with my tablet,5
461,when i got this i couldn't wait to try it out and was pleased with the results,5
462,overall i highly recommend this product and this seller i couldn't be happier with this phone or the verizon service,5
463,the backbeat 903 are so comfortable and the band that goes around the back of my ear was a bit much,5
464,i like the fit and it doesn't take away from my ipohne 5c's green color backing,5
465,the noisy background is reduced so that it does not interfere with the charging port at all,5
466,be sure to clean the screen prior to applying the screen protector,5
467,i use it for my samsung galaxy ii phone it works perfectly and at a fraction of the price,5
468,the adapters come in handy and it makes it easy to keep my ios devices fully charged,5
469,this is so smooth i don't even know it's on my ear,5
470,the power pack holds 2 charges for my iphone 5 and it came with a screen protector so that was a nice surprise,5
471,from my wife it was so cute the first time i bought it but better than huge otterbox,5
472,i thought the whole case was tpu but the back is a hard clear plastic with can be easily scratch,5
473,as far as the battery it lasts a very long time and sound quality fit and usage are all very good,5
474,5 5 stars i recommend this product to everyone that needs a screen protector and i would not protect my screen in any other way,5
475,i like that i was able to quickly charge my ipod touch 4 g kindle fire hd at the same time with no problems,5
476,this was an easy application and i will buy this product again when i need to replace these,5
477,i have had this on my windshield for a couple of weeks and it is well adhered to my leather case,5
478,i had been so impressed with my old version i also got one for my daughter who uses hers with her ipad,5
479,this is perfect for charging two tablets at the same time at the full charge rate,5
480,i read most of the reviews on here i have no doubt that it will hold the phone up vertically,5
481,this was the first time i ordered these and it was easy to put on and easy to run my finger across,5
482,i feel like it is a mini computer and i don't have to sit right next to the outlet,5
483,it is easy to remove if you need to do that but i rather play it safe,5
484,i always misplace these so it's nice to have another one of those,5
485,this device is soo handy and so desperately needed i now have two of these and would not hesitate to buy it,5
486,the case adds minimal size and weight to the phone but very small amounts,5
487,i purchased this after reading the reviews and i must say that this one is awesome to be wireless,5
488,never worry about running out of battery on my iphone and now i dont have to charge it in the day,5
489,i can also charge my iphone at the same time using only one socket,5
490,it fit everything i needed plus my phone without having to take it out of the case,5
491,the skin fits nicely and has a good feel to it and is not to bulky,5
492,they are great and very easy to get on and off so i went with the external battery,5
493,i just bought it to my mother in law and she just loved it,5

495,overall it's a pretty neat device for those who like to have a cover matching every outfit,5

497,its a great device and can be used with any other micro-usb stuff,5
498,i broke my last voyager pro by taking it out of my pocket and pop it on the mount,5
499,bought this for my wife who had never owned a smart phone before and the first thing i noticed is the comfortable feel,5

501,i normally keep my phone in my pocket and dont have to worry about misplacing my cards,5
502,fits the phone perfectly samsung galaxy s4 and seems to charge faster than most products in its product line,5
503,i've only had the phone for a few days but so far i am very impressed,5
504,with a dual usb port it allows you to charge more than one device at a time it was still very impressive charging both,5
505,after using it for almost a month and so far i'm loving it touch wood,5
506,since the keys are much closer it took a bit to get used to the corners sticking out but it's not bulky,5
507,it a holster type case with a belt clip and i must say i am quite impressed,5
508,now that i've used it for a few days and it appears to resist scratches fairly well,5
509,i recommend this device to anyone looking for a good screen protector this is the one,5
510,easy to get on and off when you need to do that but i rather play it safe,5
511,i have used other android phones in the past and this is the best of both worlds,5
512,update as of summer 2012 i still think this is a amazing and attractive little speaker,5
513,i was able to charge my phone about 4 times before having to recharge the case,5
514,note that this is not intended to be a standalone charger,5
515,the colors are bright the case is very thin and gives no extra bulk,5
516,the phone is nice i've had it for about a month now and it is still scratch free it is perfectly clear too,5
517,it was a bit tricky at first because i didn't want to lose the thinness of the phone,5
518,i find that it handles low light better than most point and shoots and even hangs with dlsr's,5
519,it's kind of unattractive but that's a price i'm willing to pay to get a phone that'll last all day,5
520,i've been using skinomi covers for a couple of years now and it has never failed me with continuous use,5
521,i have a spigen neohybrid case on my white iphone 5 and this thing looks nice on it,5
522,i have dropped this phone many times and it has not cracked or broken at all,5
523,i can still use my iphone or ipod when it's plugged into the 12v slot but a very minor annoyance,5
524,doesnt add to much bulk and is very easy to take on and off that i left it at 5 stars,5
525,the silicon rubberize cases can be hard to get in and out of a man's pants or jean pocket,5

527,it worked out perfectly for my daughter's iphone 5 at a great price and it is sharp,5
528,it's protective lightweight and doesn't add much bulk or weight to the phone,5
529,video camera5 megapixel carl zeiss lens is the best i've ever used for a cell phone,5

531,it is super cute and i always get compliments on it and it doesn't leave my phone a heavy mess,5
532,now you can charge more than one device at the same time but i haven't had any problems with it,5
533,i'm putting one of them in my kindle fire case so i have it with me at all times,5
534,i can not tell any difference between this one and the oem screen i took off the device,5
535,liked the tpu material of the pixelskin hds but they just don't seem to have enough current to charge these devices,5
536,i've never been a fan of screen protectors in the past and this one is so much better,5
537,the built in stand for the samsung gs3 version is easy to use and is a great safeguard for most compact cameras,5
538,bought for my former blackberry and love it so much i like it better then those bulky cases,5
539,the surround is raised to protect the screen in case the phone lands on the screen and everything aligns perfectly,5
540,i just bought this screen because it was going to cost me more to replace the screen,5
541,i used this charger for a couple of weeks and it works perfectly,5
542,well labeled on the protective flap and both ports can be used simultaneously to charge ipads samsung products kindles android cell phones,5
543,they quickly sent me over a new chip to replace the one in the phone while the second one is still charging,5
544,perfect fit clicked in with a snap and doesn't seem like it will wear out as quickly as every other cord,5
545,the suction cup is very strong if you have to remove it often or maybe dropping it a couple of times,5
546,but i won't need the warranty because i'm sure it's not leather but it sure does look like it is,5
547,the phone will not lay flat with this case because of the look protection and decent grip,5
548,also love that it has another usb port so you can charge a battery and the battery in use by my phone is great,5
549,the labeling is clearly placed on the front of the unit to go to the previous or next track,5
550,it fits well and looks good on the phone and it's not bulky,5
551,wow i couldn't believe how easy it was to pair and the sound,5
552,they are adorable and function just as good as the apple one but costs way less,5
553,i knew this was true because when i had plugged it into the wrong usb port or not,5
554,skinomi has stayed in place since i put it on and it was crooked of course,5
555,i have used if for a long time now and these are some of the better screen protectors i've seen,5
556,this case hands down is the best case i've had protection and looks-wise,5
557,have been using this cover for about 4 months now and it works just as it was advertised,5
558,it's sturdy and you can take it off and put it back on now and then to clean up,5
559,i bought this case for my 23 year old son and he loves it and has gotten many compliments from his friends,5
560,you need to repair every time you want to use it with the phone in a window holster,5
561,i use it for my 3rd gen ipad and my iphone from it at the same time and charge both,5
562,my wife got me one and she liked it so much that i have purchased more than one after that from amazon,5

575,i can run on the treadmill and not have to worry about charging my phone all the time,5
576,could just be personal preference as i'm used to the power being at the top not the side,5
577,the on off button and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the market that i particularly liked,5
578,i don't like the way it doesn't allow me to pick up the call by using voice command,5

596,won't get into the tech specs you should know if you are using an older smart phone e,5
597,i used this for about a year and it works perfectly like the day i got it,5
598,videos would take up a lot of space and is ugly,5

608,the buttons are cute and its a snug fit on my phone much more so than my prior phone regardless of the name,5
609,i love that i don't have to keep it plugged in just to talk to someone,5
610,so you will need a wall charger if you want to keep it looking nice make the small sacrifice,5
611,1a a micro usb input port for charging the powerbank is on the side,5
612,love the fact that you can charge your phone with a 2,5
613,both times the product was very easy to apply and high quality and performance,5
614,the phone has fallen a couple of times and the case has not cracked and my phone has not been damaged,5
615,regarding the cut it is hard to get the phone in the holder,5
616,i have had my galaxy s3 for a few weeks now and it has retained its color unlike similar phone cases,5
617,it is a little big but i wish i had one like it for mysamsung galexy s3,5
618,the case would help prevent damage if i drop it but i'm not planning on dropping my brand new baby anytime soon,5
619,it quite charging so i bought this to have a small portable usb charger,5

628,it is also equipped with over-heating over-charging over-current over-heating built-in protections,5

630,i prefer the feel and smoothness of the glass on the phone and all the information of your contacts show up,5
631,the unit comes with a 1 year warranty which is great,5
632,i've tried 3 cases listed on amazon for my nexus 4's i have like 8 now,5

634,overall i think the battery is the best bang for your buck in the current world of smart phones,5
635,snaps on perfectly is light weight and doesn't add more weight to phone,5
636,this dual port usb charger is made for power users on the go with few places to plug in,5

645,and in practice as i own an iphone 5s i don't use it but my spouse does every day,5
646,does what it says and does not interfere with the screen quality as far as i can tell this is the real deal oem,5
647,if you dim the screen it's very hard to see what's on each key,5
648,i've only had this for a couple of weeks and i've been very pleased with the amount of coverage and protection,5
649,it gets flack for being massive but i don't see it being too much of a problem,5
650,i also purchased thediztronic matte back black flexible tpu case for motorola droid bionic 4 g verizon tpu-cases retail packaging,5
651,this replacement charger works well and it's very hard to clean off,5
652,it affixes itself so well it's as if there was no screen protector on there at all,5
653,if you know what you are doing this is so easy to install i keep it in the glove box when not in use,5

655,with that being said i still love it and it's my everyday case,5
656,as always the fit is perfect and the feel is better than any case i've ever had on a case,5

663,i love that i only use one outlet to charge two things at once,5
664,i've been useing it for over a year and it just crapped out after heavy use,5
665,i've had this case for 4 months now and it is still in excellent condition as the day i received it,5
666,but this time i bought an unlocked phone because i did not want to deal with those issues even with insurance,5
667,because of these results i recommend this device to anyone that is looking for a way to charge there laptop on the go,5
668,it is a little bulky but that is expected when it only cost about a dollar,5
669,with this little device i was able to charge my iphone around 6 times,5
670,the battery pack has four led lights that let you know how much of a hassle it starts to be,5
671,my gym sessions usually last around 1hr and i've used them for as long as two hours without any discomfort,5

673,it stands out a mile in my car and i no longer have to carry a charging cable with me where ever i go,5
674,considering all the features and the quality of the audio is very very good,5
675,just hit the speaker button and i can talk while i'm riding down the highway with my convertible top down,5
676,i like it a lot and i use it with my samsung note and it works like a charm,5
677,i am not sure how well it would protect the screen from a face down drop and feels great to hold,5
678,i love that it is white and it makes it easier to hit that little nub of a on off button,5
679,i have been using this oem cable for a month and i have not needed to recharge them,5
680,now no longer have to remove the case to plug in the charger,5
681,the side is a little higher than the glass on the front of my iphone and decided to replace the the screen myself,5
682,i use these every single day and i don't have to sit next to an outlet or plug unplug it from an outlet,5
683,i have an aux port in my car and was looking for a good car mount to hold my phone,5
684,they are designed to go on there and make it look like you have the more expensive and classic iphone,5
685,we stuck my wife's iphone 4 inside in a matter of seconds and worked perfectly from that point onward,5
686,i ordered this months ago and put it on my phone but something weird was afoot,5
687,it is easy to put on and i have used them for a ton of different cool and interesting things,5

693,so far i have had this case for about 3 months now and i'm still in love,5
694,i use this every single day and i do not think i would like the note as much without it,5
695,and it also doubles the thickness of the phone so it's not even any extra cost right now,5
696,fits phone great and i have purchased a lot of cases and this was the best,5
697,i've had it less than a week so i can't comment on it until i receive the update,5
698,in addition to the great battery i feel confident that if i drop it it will not brake love amazon,5
699,this is so great and it works very well with all of my bluetooth accessories,5

701,and while it is the best phone i have ever owned or used,5
702,same high quality battery that came with my phone i have to remove the case prior to connecting,5
703,thats the big selling point for me was the fact that you can pair 2 phones to it,5

716,the case very easily clips over the phone and is a perfect fit for the samsung galaxy s4,5
717,this wallet case was just what i needed and i use it continuously,5
718,i dropped my phone in this case and it protected it better than i though it would,5
719,i think the best part that i liked about this case is the fact that there are 2 different current outputs on this charger 2,5
720,i liked it very much now they need to make one that works with my kindle fire hd,5
721,the power blades collapse to get out of the way when i use my phone for gps and hot spot plugging in is necessary,5
722,1 amp car charger is a must have for those constantly on the go,5
723,i am really impressed at how new trent was able to pull off such an amazing stylus,5
724,best quality ever from a screensaver that i have ever used on any of my phones for fit durability and appearance,5
725,i had to use a charging extender to allow me to use this with my computer necessary drivers come with dongle,5

731,i was pleased before and i'm still very happy with it and ppl ask me about it,5
732,this one is lighter and works even better and the case is much easier to hang on to than most others i've tried,5
733,go directly to the samsung website for details and step-by-step directions spoken to you while still charging your phone,5
734,it was super to be able to charge 2 devices at a time is a big plus,5
735,sure it makes the phone bigger but it's a case for a s3 galaxy and it's slate,5
736,its so comfortable and it is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer,5
737,6 amps needs 1 amp at least to charge at a fast rate i did not need something for syncing data just charging,5

739,i use this in my toyota camry hybrid 2007 and it allows me to charge and sync my phone with no issues,5

751,other than its dash method of sticking i am quite satisfied with my purchase and for the price it is great,5
752,it does cover it up but it doesn't seem to be easily scatched or anything,5
753,i got it so i could charge both my iphone and ipad at the same time,5
754,th case is great for galaxy s4 i liked it so much i bought the ad free version,5
755,pros fully charges any of the devices i have tested it on so far,5

758,the larges view window is great and easy to use even with the silicone on top of some of the buttons,5
759,the cable is thicker and longer than the one that came with my phone,5
760,as with any screen protector it is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you,5
761,i purchased this for a friend and she loves it on her galaxy s4,5

772,if you are looking for a screen protector for my samsung galaxy s5,5
773,i didn't usually do much on my phone but since i got this battery thats not the case anymore,5
774,i didn't use the ones in the pack so i can't speak to the bluetooth ability feature in this device,5
775,after reading up on similar cases for the iphone 5 i looked forward to the opportunity,5
776,the first one was for my galaxy nexus and i loved it so i ordered one,5
777,sticks really well to the front windshield and hold my samsung note 3 perfectly and the phone looks even nicer in this case,5
778,looks great and offers some protection to my phone without making it too bulky,5
779,have only used it a few times so far but it gets the job done and i like feel of this screen protector,5

785,this full body protector is a great way to protect for a great price,5
786,it works great as a qi compatible charger and i have been using it excessively since last night and today,5
787,having a rubberized loop is great so you don't use it and it appears that it might break easily,5
788,i especially like that the case still allows easy access to the side buttons and a hole for the camera,5
789,it stays on tightly but is also easy to take off and put back on and no signs of stretching,5
790,almost lost it a few times when i had to get a new phone i needed a different car charger,5
791,protection i actually brought it so i can still see the beauty of the htc one show on the surface and ends,5
792,this case is very pretty and i get lots of compliments on all my 3d phone covers,5
793,i've purchased many screen protectors and this one is by far the best i've ever had,5
794,inside the box was the power bank a micro usb charging cable and a carrying pouch though not an ac wall adapter,5
795,if you've not had a bb before it's a good idea to protect it as best as you can,5
796,this case does exactly what it's supposed to do while being astectically pleasing,5
797,they have some of the best cases for the iphone 4 if you're so inclined,5
798,i thought the crystals would fall off immediately but i am happy to say it was worth the refurbished price of 5 dollars,5
799,it's sturdy and you can take it off with one hand without looking at it while i drive,5
800,i like it so much i'm buying one for my wife's iphone,5
801,it works well and seems to be as good as any i've tried and i've tried them all,5
802,the color makes it much easier to find in my purse because it is bright,5
803,then as you slide it on rotate it at the same time to the router and there is no loss in speed,5
804,i have owned a number of sony products over the years and have been very pleased with it,5
805,the only slight complaint i have is that there is a raised lip around the front glass to prevent face-down scratching,5
806,i have had this for several months now and it still looks beautiful despite daily use and occasional clumsy drops,5
807,this case exceeds my expectations and i would recommend it to other evo 4 g users,5
808,i got this as a christmas present for my mom's new iphone and i had to put it on the charger,5
809,the sound is good and it is easy to synch up with your telephone pad or computer,5
810,all you have to do is press the one button to turn it on and hold the button to shut it off,5
811,this charger and sync cable works great and i don't have to pay apple prices to replace it,5
812,-add an igo power splittersplitter and you get the flexibility of being able to accommodate all sizes of droids is really awesome,5
813,the jelly skin fits well and makes it easier to handle the phone specially on the iphone,5
814,i really like the looks of the sleeve and it provides the protection i need without adding bulk plus it looks nice,5
815,it is important to me that i do not run out of power with my electronic devices,5
816,i received this product at no cost from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review,5
817,phone switched to usb host mode and i was able to find a video or two on youtube regarding this case,5
818,it stays on and isn't bulky and is made of a material that unlike the other colors does not scratch,5
819,i have used these in the past and have been disappointed,5
820,button access is easier than some other cases i've tried yet doesn't make the phone feel bulky when you hold it,5
821,i am very pleased to report the battery lasts a long time and the sound is outstanding,5
822,i wouldn't buy this if you are hard on your phone this case won't help you,5
823,90 % of the people i talk to say that they can hear me very well just like i speak without the headset,5
824,i was looking for a good secure phone case and didn't want to spend that much on something so easily misplaced again,5
825,i use it for work daily and the only problem i have is i do not want black grey or red,5
826,update a friendly commenter brought to my attention that holding down the power button for a few seconds and it looks brand new again,5
827,i have had this for 5 months now and it is still in good shape,5
828,overall it's a great screen protector and you get 3 of them for a super good price,5
829,although very protective and solid this case doesn't add a bunch of weight with complicated metal hinges,5
830,after using the black one in the acura for a few days i'm on the phone nonstop and kill the battery,5
831,if you really want protection bsg is the way to go for great quality price screen protectors,5
832,and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone wanting a good look for their phone,5
833,who knew that this is all it would take to get the most out of this phone is to not gimp it out,5
834,perfect case but a little difficult to get off the phone but still very cute cases,5
835,the case also wraps over the front of the screen that if you place the phone face down,5
836,i don't use it all that often but it's nice to know that i have it if i need it,5
837,i tried it as a desktop speaker phone and the person on the other end could not hear anything but my voice,5
838,when i received my free sample for review i plugged it in to charge and it was completely charged again within two hours,5
839,this charger is designed with 4 four usb ports with a total of 8 a that can be used simultaneously,5
840,to release it you don't have to struggle with it because it doesn't stick to the phone and look blotchy,5
841,so far have it on my phone for a few weeks now and have not had any problems,5
842,however it would be nice if it was louder however i can hear everyone just fine even if i'm roaring down the highway,5
843,the rubber protrudes far enough in the front to protect the screen when it's being layed on its front,5
844,very convenient and have had no issues at all with this item and has held up very well,5
845,after using one myself for two weeks i got one for my girlfriend to keep in her purse and it works well for that purpose,5
846,i did opt to install adb on my computer so i could move around and not be tied to my desk,5
847,the case does add some weight to the phone but its well worth it to have it protected,5
848,it has a little lip around the front of the screen which has been a lifesaver,5
849,it's great to be able to charge two items at the same time but that's because it came from china,5
850,all ports can be accessed and the case was easy to put on and i would definitely recommend,5
851,i have started to rely on this power pack to get me through the day this device is a lifesaver for sure,5
852,i charged my iphone at the same time with the iphone playing music,5
853,i was skeptical but i now don't need to worry about running out of electricity,5
854,6 amps the first necessary for more power hungry devices like the ipad the other is 1 a and is for phones,5
855,i mean it usually takes 2-3 hours to charge but provides 7-8 hours of listening time,5
856,solar panel feature the solar panel is on one side of the case and the pink looks so good with my white s3,5
857,i like the color of it and the fact that it charges my phone and tablet quite well,5
858,has a nice sized lip to protect the screen when it's being layed on its front,5
859,stick all these icons on one row so i don't have to worry about anything touching the camera lens,5
860,the call quality is the best of any bluetooth headset i've ever had,5
861,it really cuts down the glare now i can see who's calling without taking your eyes off the road,5
862,for the money this should be a no-brainer if you need to charge more than one or two items,5
863,there is a screw on the back so that you can hang it up on a wall,5
864,they are awesome i would really get these i've only used one and it has lasted and done it's job,5
865,one thing to be aware of is that the case will not protect the iphone as well as a variety of other usb chargeable devices,5
866,i have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to charge both my phone and ipad at the same time,5
867,but it does come with a screen protector but it didn't hold up as well as skinomi,5
868,i'm using this with my galaxy s3 and it works just as good as hers,5
869,it isn't bulky at all fits the phone like a glove and protects it very well,5
870,it has 2 usb ports so i can charge my iphone ipad kindle and power accessory all at the same time,5
871,i bought it for easter and have had it on my phone for months and dont plan on changing it anytime soon,5
872,i'm ordering 4 of them now so i never have to worry about leaving the house with a dead battery again,5
873,i have the at t iphone 4s and the only part of the phone exposed is the trackball,5
874,it came as described and i would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of stellar headphones,5
875,the unit is very easy to use and has endless possibilities,5
876,charges my ipad and iphone at the same time and it saves me space in my outlets,5
877,if you were using it with the otterbox i'm sure it would fit future phones you might have too,5
878,led is bright but not blindingi will have to see if i can get my money back and purchase a different brand,5
879,that 8217s what convinced me to put one on my iphone 4s and now the iphone 5,5
880,with my permission lol now i will be buying another one soon but a different color,5
881,the usb outlets are on the face of the charger glows when you plug it into your power in the car,5
882,the ears are super cute and i love the way the phone is shaped,5
883,i don't know what more to say other than it gives a clear view of your screen,5
884,this has a frosted back but when you put it on a white phone it looks completely clear,5
885,let me start by saying that this is a really good wall charger,5
886,this charger charges the battery fairly quickly and i like that i can retract the tip when it is not in use,5
887,it is a great relief to be able to plug my mp3 player into it when i return from bike rides,5
888,keep in mind that this screen protector is a must have for your truck if you travel or experience low signal reception,5
889,it is difficult to find a quality bluetooth headset that will work with my android phone for voice dialing,5
890,no background noise and no one can really hear that i am on a headset when i am using the jabra supreme,5
891,i almost didn't buy it because of the fact that it was difficult to fit into a purse or briefcase,5
892,my personal use scenario is when i need to charge it twice a day,5
893,people seem to be able to hear me clearly no matter where i am and what i'm using the iphone for,5
894,i have also used this to charge my cell phone and i love it,5
895,i was very pleased with the performance of this charger and i highly recommend giving them a read,5
896,oddly i'm surprised how often i need to charge more than one device without needing to immediately recharge the moonstone,5
897,it has enough juice to charge my phone while i'm out and about or on the road for business,5
898,summary first and foremost it has protected my phone from scratches and never came off,5
899,the bow appears much sturdier than i thought it was going to feel cheap or not fit right,5
900,i am extrememly happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone,5
901,i've never had a problem with these shields and love the fact that they have thick pliable 6 foot cords,5
902,this provides a nice lift so you can set the phone down screen facing downward without worry,5
903,by randomness my friend bought the same type of case for some of my other phones,5
904,i charged two things at once a couple of times and didn't recieve any damage to my phone,5
905,i never change the screen protector on my phone since i revived it,5
906,i am very satisfied with this device and would recommend this to friends if they had a samsung galaxy s4,5
907,for my galaxy nexus it lasts approximately two and a half charges for my phone from a fully charged battery pack,5
908,i let it charge long enough to be able to charge them on the go this is what you need,5
909,i found the range to be under 30 feet but that is not a problem with this device but with qi charging in general,5
910,i have tried the various 3 m screen protectors and this one is by far the most premium,5
911,there's also a pull-out micro usb cable built into the side of the unit see attached photo collage,5
912,long story short i had a mophie juice pack for my old iphone 4 and i loved it,5
913,you can pretty much drop the phone and it protects it very well for my personal daily use,5
914,0 with aptx and enhanced data rate works every bit as well as the 200 counterpart i got from best by,5
915,there is a mini usb input to charge the battery and a spare or two to use while charging,5
916,this provides a nice margin of back-up for those days when you are using your phone as a gps to reach your destination,5
917,i love this case so much that when i upgraded my phone the first thing i did was pop off that screen protector,5
918,i get a lot of compliments and when i tell them how much i paid for some of my older speakers,5
919,plenty of sound and for the price you'd be hard pressed to tell it's got a cover,5
920,i've had this for a month and have had no issues with any of my cables hooking up to my phone,5
921,the one downfall of its sleek design is that it does not have some s-pen functionality,5
922,the only negative i found is that it does not work so well in vertical format,5
923,the ct14 from plantronics is by far the best i've ever come across,5
924,5 mm headphones has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to clothing or whatever when not in use,5
925,the plastic edges are perfect if you tend to drop your phone on a concrete floor every now and then,5
926,i had to relocate it and had a heck of a time making fine adjustments on the gain,5
927,first of all let me start by saying that i work for a company that requires me to travel and be outside a lot,5
928,this case add's the right amount of grip to the phone without adding much size and it looks good,5
929,i can use the manufacturer supplied usb cable for my phone and it still fits into the cellphone pocket in my purse,5
930,everything that i say in this review is based on my wife's feedback on the case,5
931,it fits great and i like that it has a solar panel on it and charges itself,5
932,overall i can recommend the sabrent to anyone who wants a very subtle slim case on their gs4,5
933,bought for my 3 yr old son to be able to use my devices in other location,5
934,you can do this as many times as you want as long as you have the stated model s2,5
935,i also like the texture of the case as well as its ability to protect the phone,5
936,they were perfect and i love that i can put the case in my pocket with the backside out,5
937,work outside with gloves and this makes it so nice i don't have to look for where did my phone fell great tool,5
938,it works great to improve my grip on the phone while i am in the shower but others might be,5
939,protective screen was very easy to install and is very durable,5
940,the phone sticks up a little so it's easy to take them out when needed and place them back in,5
941,i have tried several screen protectors and this is one of the nicest phones i have used,5
942,it may be a cheaper product but as long as it works i will live with a rather short cord,5
943,then i told them it still had power left to charge these just about one more time,5
944,i am always careful with my phone so i don't need anything heavy duty to protect it,5
945,this is really a great phone holder and i am using it for my kindle fire and kodak sport hd cam recharged quick,5
946,this powergen 8400mah mobile juice pack ultra packs a lot of power into a small and cost-effective device,5
947,a little tough to remove but that's not a big deal and it may fit your vehicle differently,5
948,but once the product is installed in the equipment it's a very good product for the price d would recommend to anyone,5
949,it was an awesome case i use it almost every day and friends love it too,5
950,9830 look and installation the product came in a clear professional looking box with product information on all sides,5
951,i can honestly say that this screen protector is the best on the market for the price,5
952,the seller did follow up via email to let me know that this charger also worked just fine on her home charge,5
953,the charger is pretty solid and rugged so i don't worry about the screen getting scratched on the table,5
954,the phone also charges more slowly however i can get a full charge of iphone 5s from 5 % to 100 % twice,5
955,i have had this for a few months now it is by far the best car charger that i've ever used,5
956,the only thing it needs is the ability to charge both the devices up to 100 % using the pack,5
957,so far my wife hasn't had any problems with the case interfering with the screen protector,5
958,also the plastic screen protector is terrible it would be better if it came witha removable screen protector,5
959,this case can withstand everything i love these cases bought this one for my wife and it is very well put together,5
960,this case is much higher quality than other kits i have purchased in the past plus it's a lot cheaper,5
961,the dual ports are great able to charge my iphone and ipad mini at the same time,5
962,there's a small neoprene case as well if you are going to take it on the road and stream google's music,5
963,i purchased this item initially for myself to use with my new htc evo 4 g lte,5
964,what i wasn't too sure about the quality when i first read the reviews with everyone having mixed but over all good reviews,5
965,this one actually charges my s4 all the way to 100 % i usually do this while sleeping,5
966,this case is one of the best i have ordered yet,5
967,i bought two of these one for myself and another for a friend and she is pleased as well,5
968,upgraded from a galaxys iii and i couldn't be more happier with now cute it is,5
969,note that i received a review sample and was a little put off by the anti glare look,5
970,mine came 2 led's charged and it took less than 2 hours to charge an iphone in full sun,5
971,it fit so perfect that i bought another one for my wife's car once we upgrade her phone,5
972,besides being a great product it was delivered very quickly and is very cost effective,5
973,attractive it's got a snazzy look to it and doesn't smudge like some other ones,5
974,it comes with two usb ports so you can charge 2 i phones or 2 androids,5
975,this is an awesome product that i use for my iphone 5 but i like this case better and it was cheaper,5
976,looks as it does in the picture and it fits the iphone 5,5
977,a full charge takes about 2 hours with a micro-usb cable but it also takes commonly available usb 3,5
978,this case is just wonderful battery charges my phone from 10 % to full took around an hour or so,5
979,maybe because it's new and i used it right out of the box the charger came with 75 % 3 lights charge,5
980,i got it on in one try with no bubbles to even push out,5
981,i had read that many chargers can be a bit of a worry that it won't last out,5
982,it's perfect for the price and very easy to use so that you do not have to increase the volume,5
983,the tip is a fine mesh that is much more responsive than the rubber plastic ones out there,5
984,its like i'm able to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great,5
985,i got this in a little early which is always a good thing from amazon and free shipping too,5
986,i like the fact that it fits tightly enough to protect the back and sides from scratches and it served this purpose perfectly,5
987,it is super easy to use simply plug it in to charge it or have something charging from it,5
988,i can not have a cover on my phone and it fit very well,5
989,not a scratch or scuff and i've had this for several weeks now and absolutely love it,5
990,i been replacing iphone screens for about 3 years now and have gone through so many cases,5
991,the iphone hides its single external speaker on the bottom of the speaker and is held in place by magnets,5
992,i have to say this case is by far the best iphone 5 case on the market for price and style,5
993,with on-ear headphones in the past this has been the case for the rest of the iphones including the iphone 5,5
994,i tried several inane tricks including attempting to install the protector in the bathroom after running a hot shower for the steam,5
995,the sides of the case extend to protect the screen when it stick it in my pocket or purse,5
996,i have dropped my phone a bunch of times and it held up nicely,5
997,i sync my phone at home and at work and i bought this one to replace it,5
998,1a a micro usb input port for charging the powerbank is on the side,5
999,the august wireless speaker comes with its own usb cable to charge the device you can use with this adapter,5
1000,so just remember to push it in once or twice a week and this is one of her fav ones,5
1001,this phone case is great its great quality and it really protects your phone that i purchase this green one,5
1002,one of the best things about this headset is it doesn't have a button that need to be pressed before activating the charge,5
1003,i absolutely love this case it fits perfectly and i love the bright fun color,5
1004,anker is a great product and i highly recommend this to all ya new gs3 owners to consider purchasing this,5
1005,it's plastic and the color is exactly as pictured and protects the phone like no other yep,5
1006,i bought two one for a friend of mine and the person loved it,5
1007,there is an exception to this the charger is not compatible with ipd hp touchpad asus transformer or motorola xoom,5
1008,untill then it's one of the best that i have seen,5
1009,not much to say here other than this is exactly what i wanted and it is so easy to clean,5
1010,the commuter version corrected this for and i feel that my phone is well protected without too muck bulk,5
1011,in addition i can use the same charger i use for my cell phone gps and my mp3 player universal for all,5
1012,i have this for a travel phone and don't have to dig around in my purse to find it and the cords,5
1013,at first i thought the blue light would be too bright but it is accurately represented on the website,5
1014,can not complain as the price is the best you can get because it is made for samsung hardware not all hardware,5
1015,it still has charge left at the end of the day this is a business tool,5
1016,i wish it had an option for charging in the car but no charging adapter for 110vac power,5
1017,installation it was easy to install i have been using screen protectors for years going back to my palm pilot days,5
1018,1 amps total current it has plenty of juice to charge my phone with plenty of capacity to spare,5
1019,if your an outdoors man or a mechanic like me this is a must have to get the extra battery life juice you need,5
1020,i was looking for an extra cheap cable to charge my nexus 7 and nexus and my gf's ipad 2,5
1021,it still shows off the phone and provides good protection without making the phone even bigger,5
1022,this case is one of my favorites because it has a front and a back which is nice,5
1023,this is a nice product useful and i use it almost daily for either running or biking,5
1024,it is very easy to insert into the phone and the back cover also fits snugly with the phone,5
1025,it's on my phone now and i love the fact that it came with a screen protector,5
1026,it works perfectly in my 2006 mini cooper holding the phone just above the radio superior to resting on the dash,5
1027,bought this for the girlfriend and she loves the looks and the sturdiness of the product makes it even better,5
1028,i love that it is so quick to take my phone in and out of my pocket without catching on anything,5
1029,the first screen protector from many that i didn't have to sink it like the others,5
1030,so if you use a case and don't want to have a bulge in your pocket,5
1031,i would suggest getting a larger battery if you intend to use this at work you better recharge it during lunch,5
1032,inside the box you will find everything you need to charge your phone tablet and you need to use the gps,5
1033,provides good grip and an edge around the screen so if you place your phone face-down on a table,5
1034,it keeps the slim profile the material lets you take it in and out the worse that looseness will get,5
1035,there are a million ipod cases out there but this one is more than good enough for reading and browsing outdoors on a sunny day,5
1036,i've caught the attention of many of my co-workers with one and ask her about it,5
1037,i've already dropped my phone with this case on it inside another case,5
1038,i would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for good protection and privacy,5
1039,so if you use a case and don't want to have to worry about bringing my cords,5
1040,i actually have a few of these in different colors and they are so cute and durable for the phone,5
1041,i love this is is really great to be able to charge apple and android devices at the same time,5
1042,a small slit glows yellow on the front of the unit and the other is basically the same as the airstash,5
1043,as for me i have had this battery for over a year now and it's still holding up strong,5
1044,it does fit on the phone and the colors of the case match great,5
1045,it even comes with a dash adhesive if you want to mount it it comes with 2 mounting screws,5
1046,it is a very low price for a case that will protect your phone against drops cracking it,5
1047,the size of this battery will be a little big compared to the one i used to buy at apple store,5
1048,includes a 2 gb micro sd card in it but so far i haven't had that problem,5
1049,i choose this item because the original one that came with the phone and hold it's charge well no cheap knock off,5
1050,in the end the second time was the charm and it is on there perfectly with no bubbles or peeling on the edges,5
1051,it works well i've been using it for over 3 months without any issues,5
1052,i tested the charger with my samsung android cellphone 1800mah battery and an amazon kindle fire hd 7 4400mah battery,5
1053,i got this for my brother and he fell in love with it and with the other colours that it came with,5
1054,now my nexus feels more solid in the hand and i can not complain so far,5
1055,it works beautiful and i am glad i was able to get a replacement quickly and this one works well,5
1056,as others have said the suction cup is very strong if you have to remove it often or maybe dropping it a couple of times,5
1057,i still give this 5 stars because it is so much better than having the phone in my pocket,5
1058,overall this is a great charger that is definitely worth the money if you need a replacement or second charger-cable set,5
1059,like many has said it makes the phone feel more sturdy in my hand,5
1060,i read using the kindle app on my phone a lot and it still in one piece with no cracks,5
1061,it has a built in speakerphone function if you want to use it as an alarm clock an ambient sound machine and charger,5
1062,this phone by far is the best i have ever had and from what i've read the experiences others have had,5
1063,i recommend this case for a simple reason it does a good job protecting her phone while not being bulky,5
1064,it worked with just about any tablet some cases won't work with car chargers and speakers but this does,5
1065,i have accidentally dropped the phone a couple of times on concrete no damage to the phone and only minor scrapes on the plastic itself,5
1066,cons like any protector like this you have to take your time and do the prep-work,5
1067,very easy to get in and out of your pocket for every day use,5
1068,it's definitely something that would be excellent to carry in your laptop bag or in my case a fanny pack,5
1069,i had some bad luck and the one i received didn't even need a charge right away,5
1070,great for a phone that wont be near a wall socket i bring it with me,5
1071,7 strong i've dropped it a couple of time and it worked perfectly,5
1072,finally i can say that i will stop having to run out of power on your mobile device at a critical moment,5
1073,these luxe lean cases have to be one of the best modern day gadgets accessories to date,5
1074,it took a little getting used to but once you got it charges great,5
1075,i charged my bluetooth headphones my iphone and my kindle fire both more than once from this charger,5
1076,i bought this item two months ago and it still works as well as it did when i first made my purchase on amazon,5
1077,with a 6 foot cable i can lay in bed and play with my phone now,5
1078,at this price i bought 4 more so i don't have to reach to get to it,5
1079,it fits the front of the phone from edge to edge and does a really good job at protecting my investment,5
1080,i did try fixing it a couple of times and it still worked perfectly,5
1081,with day to day use i love how thin it is but does a great deal of proction,5
1082,i also love that it is slightly see through and you can see the color on the back edges but that's it,5
1083,the two immediately recognized one another and i was able to play music spotify itunes pandora whatever i wanted,5
1084,i tested charging an ipad 3 and an iphone 5 at the same time but the incredicharge has the capability to do it,5
1085,they are about five times more thick than the one that came with my phone and for that price you can't go wrong,5
1086,this makes the buttons a little hard to push which is a good thing because the case does a good job of protecting the phone,5
1087,i did tighten the strap significantly around the back of my head doesn't interfere much with my neck,5
1088,i have a spring epic 4 g and was looking for a vent mount and this combo is a great price and quality,5
1089,while this thing sure can take a while to charge it up fully but once you do you can really fly on it,5
1090,it is easy to snap on and relatively easy to take off when i feel like changing it,5
1091,if the galaxy s3 is top of the line and for the price there is nothing better then this,5
1092,it took a bit long to get here but when it arrived i was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset,5
1093,just received my case today and put it on my phone right away and i love it,5
1094,i've been using this for several months now and it still works as if its brand new,5
1095,i think they are original but if not you wont be able to give a strong current to 2 tablets simultaneously,5
1096,i just got this a few days ago and let's just say it's no longer his back up,5
1097,the grips interfer with the buttons on the side of the phone or that it has sharp edges,5
1098,i purchased this item a couple months ago and have to say that i am even more impressed with this screen than before,5
1099,this battery is flawless and is by far the best stylus pen i have ever used,5
1100,i currently use it with my nexus 5 and nexus 7 as fast as my other charging pads,5
1101,even though it's a little darker than the picture but i bought it for my mom and she loves it,5
1102,its nice to have another charging cable i keep this one in my purse along with my charging cable,5
1103,3 remove one screen protector from the package and place it on top of the dash so you can then install the suction cup,5
1104,it's a simple media cable that does what it needs to do without any issues or flaws,5
1105,i liked this product so much i bought one for my dad as well,5
1106,they haven't had any issues with not being able to hear the person on the other end,5
1107,my phone screen is always protected when i'm not using my mophie i love the various colors too,5
1108,this is a great screen protector easy to put on and off of your phone,5
1109,the protector is made of durable material and feels good in your hand so as not to slip right out,5
1110,the iphone 5 is my 4th iphone and i've never used a screen protector on any phone i've owned,5
1111,well i accidentally dropped it again and there was no damage to the screen or any dents in the phone,5
1112,first off i'm careful with my phone so there was no need to get a knife to open it,5
1113,i am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others,5
1114,the case wraps all the way around to the front of the phone and a little lip for the camera,5
1115,the fit is spot on and after using it for a couple weeks now and has withstood significant jarring,5
1116,it tells you exactly what's using battery on your phone so you can listen to tunes while holding the phone,5
1117,i definitely recommend this product as a matter of fact i have them on my head right now,5
1118,i use the cover while i work and have dropped it several times and i cant find a scratch,5
1119,i'm glad i didn't have to buy anything additional,5
1120,bought this case thinking it was for the iphone 5 and not the 4,5
1121,i keep this in my car and the one that came with my phone samsung giii and for a great price,5
1122,my family does have others newtrent products but i like the sleek look and it has a great feel and the kickstand is brilliantly implemented,5
1123,this case fills out around the phone and gives you a beep that it's beginning to charge,5
1124,the tips should last a while as long as i don't have my portenzo case on it,5
1125,nice not the base but it won't slip out of my hands like my glide case,5
1126,i bought this for my wife she has had it several months and it hasn't stretched out one bit,5
1127,in the morning i wake up to a 100 % charged phone and battery,5
1128,i have a note 3 and i was curious to see if i could play games online,5
1129,as if you had a photoshop app i love this phone and i am still using it every day as i drive for a living,5
1130,i felt that was very reasonable and it was nice to have this back-up battery for my ipod 4th generation,5
1131,i highly recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a great charger for their 4s,5
1132,this is a great charger the convenience of being able to easily place it on a pad,5
1133,but for the fact that this thing is basically the size of a sharpie pen cap clipped to your shirt,5
1134,it is so convenient to be able to charge my phone on the go,5
1135,while a bit bigger than a deck of cards and it slips easily into my pocket,5
1136,i also get lots of compliments on it and it was well worth the wait,5
1137,the build seems pretty good and i expect to last about as long as the battery that came with the phone,5
1138,i've tested it by charging my cell phone from dead empty to a complete charge,5
1139,no comparison to the original it works just as well and even better then some of those other expensive phone chagers,5
1140,bought this case thinking it was for the iphone 5 but it's drop resistant,5
1141,i have been using my bolkin s-100 charger for over a week now and hasn't needed to re-charge it yet,5
1142,but man it took me three tries to figure out what to do with the excess cable,5
1143,when i received the new magicbox i immediately paired it with my ipod touch and my cellphone,5
1144,it was in perfect condition and works fine again i am very pleased with this phone and still amazed it only costs 230 unlocked,5
1145,the elements don't bother the case at all and the battery cover should stay in place,5
1146,better to have an extra port and not need it than to need it and not have it,5
1147,i love hello kitty and i love this phone case i bought it for my wife's phone motorola droid razr m,5
1148,just budget enough time to recharge it because it takes a long time to charge ok though because it has a large capacity,5
1149,holding mechanismthis is what i really like about this iflash wall charger is that it comes with a carrying bag so easy to pack,5
1150,blue light is fairly bright and i wouldn't want to be taking it on and off,5
1151,some people complain about the case coming around the front of the screen which is really nice with a phone this expensive,5
1152,i've had it less than a week so i can't speak for how well it works with them,5
1153,a year later it's still on my phone and it's low on battery,5
1154,the rubber bumps built into the bezel help with the lay on the table design to protect the screen when you place it face down,5
1155,this is a good case for the price i bought it i really have nothing to complain about,5
1156,my car only has one lighter jack in the front so it's not completely flush with the phone,5
1157,get this you get three protectors in case you mess one up and have to do it again,5
1158,the plug even folds into the body of the device for easy storage travel,5
1159,the case goes on easy and the buttons are all easy to push and all ports are easily accessible,5
1160,the jewels have stayed on amid the case fits my phone perfectly and it is exactly what i want,5
1161,that last point is the price you pay for protection of the phone and it keeps my phone very securely in place,5
1162,it is a great case that doesn't add a lot of mass to the nexus,5
1163,the mytouch 4 g had 35 % battery charge when i plugged it into the wall and it read % 001 charge which seemed odd,5
1164,the raised lip allows you to put you phone face down and not worry about it being directly on the table,5
1165,i have had several iphones for a few years and i'm sure this one will too,5
1166,since it's oblong it doesn't take up much space in my purse,5
1167,you need one of these if you drop your phone a lot it may not be as tight as when it was first put on,5
1168,i works just a little static when calling but other than that it works great and the instructions are relatively accurate,5
1169,i was a little skeptical about this considering some of the bad reviews but it seems like this is the only way,5
1170,just to be clear it does not come with any type of screen protector,5
1171,this is my second purchase of this product because i wanted to have a spare charger to leave at my office,5
1172,it was pretty easy to install if you take the time to really learn them,5
1173,on my first full charge i was able to charge my iphone twice,5
1174,this is pretty much the size of a stick of juicy fruit gum,5
1175,and finally a tough rubbery outer shell that hugs around the back of the phone which matches the stock completely when it comes to cosmetics,5
1176,we go overnight fishing and it is nice to know that the phone isn't going crazy trying to figure out whether it has power,5
1177,this battery has 4 blue led to indicate the amount of charge remaining 1 25 % 2 50 % etc,5
1178,the protection seems great i've dropped my phone once or twice and it's protected the phone quite well,5
1179,i received the blackberry bold a little over a year ago i might by the new version,5
1180,just squeegee to the sides of the phone so that's what i did on the second try,5
1181,i like this case becasue it really does protect the phone and the fit is flawless,5
1182,i got the trasluscent gray case and it looks and feels great except for the on off button are all touch sensitive,5
1183,i was skeptical after reading some of the reviews for this item are being merged from different sellers,5
1184,feels like a phone feels nice in my hand and it offers the protection i desired,5
1185,this privacy screen is great it does exactly what it was intended to do and i had no problem recieving it,5
1186,some will complain about the installation but i have never had any problems with air bubbles or fingerprints,5
1187,it's still a little bit shiny but does a very good job of protecting the body of the phone and the screen,5
1188,the battery has four lights to indicate how much of a charge is left 4-3-2-1,5
1189,my girlfriend was all the time talking on the phone and all the information of your contacts show up,5
1190,fix the root problem and you don't need the other things otterbox has to offer,5
1191,i'm no camera expert but i do a fair amount of buying and selling of iphones,5
1192,great for on the go as i use my phone all day cause of the type of work i do,5
1193,she has had it for over 2 years now and i still love it,5
1194,i feel more confident being oncall 24 7 and i don't want to install one just for that button,5
1195,i was skeptical because of the low price but i have had it for several months and still in great condition,5
1196,otterbox continually keeps making some great products and i have never had any problems with air bubbles or fingerprints,5
1197,i also love the fact that i can charge two devices at once typically with power left over,5
1198,this is a durable case that goes on easily and fits perfectly but can be removed quickly if necessary,5
1199,it's very handy to be able to have a fully charged phone in 15 minutes but works great otherwise,5
1200,first of all the sound is better than i would have ever expected from something of it's size,5
1201,you can also sync and charge at the same time no need to look for an outlet at the airports,5
1202,slim enough to allow pocketing slick enough to get in and out of my pants pocket without any trouble,5
1203,the case is extremely cute i always get compliments when i've got them plugged into my phone,5
1204,i've noticed that some of the other reviews have complained that it doesn't cover the complete phone and wish they offer back covers,5
1205,i bought one for my note 2 blue and one for my wife's car and iphone 4s cell phone,5
1206,it's super thin and the back has a nice silky rubber like feel,5
1207,i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review,5
1208,doesn't take away any features of the phone and it is just as good as any other case in its class,5
1209,i had the otterbox for my iphone 4s but did not want to spend a lot of money on a apple plug anymore,5
1210,it keeps my necessities as well as having openings so i can charge my phone garmin gps bluetooth headset bluetooth music receiver etc,5
1211,i received this case the other day and so far i'm averaging 32-35 hours 100 % 10 %,5
1212,not even the face of the phone because it seems to be exactly what they are looking for,5
1213,go into a bathroom close the door and turn the shower on hot to fill the bathroom with steam,5
1214,i have had this product for about a month or so and it hasn't given me any trouble,5
1215,love the fold out on the back i use it all the time when i go out walking running,5
1216,the material is sturdy and all the buttons are easy to push unlike the last case i had purchased,5
1217,perfect length so i don't have cords all over the place both when in use and when being stored,5
1218,the people i called could not tell that i was pressing the mute button,5
1219,my original battery was good for about 5-6 hours a day with no battery issues,5
1220,it cleared up my sockets and now i can use the 5 pin or 11 pin,5
1221,i've been through a bunch of cases for my iphone 5 and there have been a couple of standouts,5
1222,my husband loves the matte flat finish on the back of the case which looks awesome and is unique,5
1223,the ambient noise is significantly less and i don't have to deal with the overhead lighting glaring off my screen,5
1224,this one didn't say qi charger and i don't know the systems so i use google maps to get around,5
1225,usability when being put on the device and usability when the device is in use 8211 particularly pretty and helpful at night,5
1226,it's been a week and i'm still impressed with it's features and easy quick navigation,5
1227,sturdy sleek still bigger than i wanted but it is really well made and will not tilt over since it feels solid,5
1228,overall the otterbox case is an attractive case that fits the iphone 4 great and looks good while doing it,5
1229,i will highly recommend and will buy from them again and will use more of these as the need arises,5
1230,when i got this i couldn't wait to try it out ohhhh and the shipping was fast amazing,5
1231,i've used a lot of bluetooth headsets over the years and this is easily my favorites,5
1232,the price is great and it is a very good quality headset for use all day long,5
1233,nice to have a backup for travel so i don't have to carry a purse all the time with it,5
1234,great when you need a quick charge you just lay it on the charging pad and the charging station will do the rest,5
1235,my only complaint is that it is a bit heavy but not to big to carry around,5
1236,now that i've had this longer i can say that it's still working great after a year,5
1237,if you need a cell phone mount you won't find one better in this case style so don't even bother,5
1238,i bought it thinking it was for the iphone 5 but it turned out to be almost like a peach color,5
1239,first for my tablet and now i bought it for a friend but may have to get another for another friend,5
1240,good value for the money if you are looking for a low price high quality plastic case,5
1241,she says it is so nice that it is clear so i can show the white nexus logo,5
1242,the case is thin enough that it's easy to carry in my pouch,5
1243,i'm very pleased with this case and i would definitely buy more if they started making them in more colors,5
1244,the sound quality is very good and the person on the other end can't tell i'm on a headset,5
1245,the price is right it adds grip to the phone when in my hand,5
1246,i would not hesitate to recommend this device to anyone looking for a solid phone free of contract,5
1247,good to be able to charge two things at one time,5
1248,it does not feel like it is going to fall off,5
1249,the case looks great and i really like how it looks from the back of the phone,5
1250,it is durable and i will definitely be purchasing more in the near future unhappy with the clips,5
1251,the voice recognition software is the best i've tried and rival apple cables in quality,5
1252,for some reason you lose the click you feel when you press the power button on the battery and the device should begin to charge,5
1253,i have actually had this for awhile now and it shows no signs of wear and tear after several months of daily use,5
1254,protection i actually brought it so i can still see the beautiful wooden back my phone has,5
1255,had a spec of debris under one corner but i was able to lift readjust and put it on straight,5
1256,i received it on time and it is just like it plugged into a regular wall charger,5
1257,the only bad thing i can say is that it does take about 18 hours to fully charge this battery,5
1258,it also clips on your belt if you don't want to get the case or the phone covered in paint,5
1259,was used in a diy project so don't know how it works but it looks cool on her phone,5
1260,i'm able to charge my phone and my son's kindle charged,5
1261,holds the phone very securely and i do not worry about dropping the phone at all,5
1262,the only con i can think of is the fact that the phone is upright instead of laying flat on my desk,5
1263,when its plugged in it takes up very little room 4 34 x 3,5
1264,i was pleasantly surprised to find it comes with a built-in cord so i can keep my original cable,5
1265,i have order 3 of these cases in different colors in the future but for now this does the job well,5
1266,this is the best bumper i have ever bought and when i get a new iphone i will use this comapny again,5
1267,also i'd read so much about the material it's made of it's a strong rubber,5
1268,this time around i skipped buying anything extra because i was in search of a comfortable set of ear buds headphones,5
1269,i know since that's how long it takes to get the phone that far,5
1270,this is one of the best ones in the market for the price at which it is advertised,5
1271,the screen protector that came with the case was easy to apply and i love looking at hello kitty all the time,5
1272,nothing else can describe it better than the fact that it is very slim yet seems to protect well,5
1273,that means you can charge 3 devices at the same time but it allows you to carry the essentials with you everywhere,5
1274,i have used many iphone and android screen protectors and this is by far the highest capacity at 9000mah and also amps,5
1275,i thought it was ok and it certainly protected my phone from the car accident i was in,5
1276,detailed review 9830 look and installation the product came in a clear professional looking box with product information on it,5
1277,the only downside i have to this case is that the corners have slipped off my phone a couple of times and it was protected,5
1278,i have charged the following devices at the same time with no fear of running out of juice,5
1279,favorite feature many iphone 5 cases make pressing the on off button on the side as opposed to the top,5
1280,it is easy to keep in my purse for when i am in someone else's car,5
1281,first of all think about being able to charge your device over and over,5
1282,my main gripe right away is the power and volume buttons on the side but that is okay,5
1283,the only down fall is i can not find a cover like this one for it,5
1284,shipped on time and it was exactly what i ordered and fit i would recommend this as a convenient phone mounting option,5
1285,it's small enough to carry around in my laptop bag so i can charge my phone,5
1286,this holder was supplied to me in exchange for an unbiased review of this product,5
1287,so i am thrilled that i finally have a headset that stayed on my ears while working out,5
1288,i put the headset on and my phone in my pocket and that is why i went with the iphone 5,5
1289,this had to the best case i have ever had for a phone,5
1290,first of all i received a free sample of this product for purposes of honest review,5
1291,i would like to have it a little smaller to make it easier to fit into a front or back pocket with ease,5
1292,pros powerful enough to charge every device i've tried so far and is inexpensive compared to others,5
1293,battery life i've had it on for over a week now i can say that i definitely made the right choice,5
1294,if you do data heavy tasks or talk on the phone a lot the case has held up,5
1295,the sides are grippy enough to make the phone much easier to grip and it doesn't feel so fragile,5
1296,one thing that i really like about this charger is the fact that it has an internal spring output plug,5
1297,it has 5v 12v 16v and 19v output so i can charge my iphone and my tablet at the same time,5
1298,i have had this mount for a few weeks and i'm pretty impressed,5
1299,although it's pretty big doesn't fit in my pocket or store conveniently at all,5
1300,i've been using one of these for a couple of months and the best part is there is a lifetime warranty,5
1301,plus with the screen protector i don't have to worry about recharging it or having a cable draped across my dashboard,5
1302,i love the color of this case as well as it's small size,5
1303,the only thig i don't really like about it is that it's small and handy and holds 10400mah in capacity,5
1304,the sound quality is quite good they have a long enough cord and i absolutely love the flat cord,5
1305,was very happy with the quality of this case's construction,5
1306,also it has a nice subtle edge in the front so it's great to keep both devices running on long trips,5
1307,we've always used invisible shield produts but i don't like the circle around the apple logo,5
1308,the realook protectors were very easy to apply and seem to protect the screen beautifully,5
1309,i switched from a spigen slim armor case which was a major fingerprint magnet,5
1310,at one full charge this battery is able to charge my iphone 5 regardless of the message,5
1311,this item was bought for my wife's new iphone 4s,5
1312,there is even room to plug in the recharger while the phone is in the carry case but not for the power cord,5
1313,if i'm going to be out and about for the day and my phone shows a remaining 20 % 30 % charge,5
1314,okay i really like this one it came on time and was well packaged,5
1315,it doesn't in my opinion i tried the otterbox commuter and replaced it with the q card case,5
1316,update 9 9 11 i've been using this for about 6 months now on my note and am completely satisfied,5
1317,i was able to fit my iphone 5 with a case on it though,5
1318,i like it so much that i have been using it quite heavily for the past week,5
1319,there is also the feature that allows you to charge the phone as well as access data,5
1320,if you want the charger cord to be attached to the phone making it bigger and more obtuse,5
1321,the case offers decent protection too i dropped my phone the other day and it landed at the bottom without a scratch,5
1322,i've had this case for 4 months now and there is no problem with using the touchid,5
1323,i charged my iphone 4 from 19 % charge and my ipad 2 that had 62 % charge and charged them simultaneously,5
1324,went on easy and i have only had to charge them once and have gotten a lot of compliments from men and women,5
1325,i've had this for about a month now and it's pretty bad,5
1326,i give this product five stars because it works perfectly with my iphone 5s gs3 even blackberry z10,5
1327,if you want a case that will protect your phone without making it look like crap,5
1328,this cover is thin and adds very little size to the phonehighly recommend,5
1329,it has a front lip so you can place the phone in the belt clip face out,5
1330,this case is so great like perfect for when i don't want a bulky case in my pocket,5
1331,i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of any phone i've ever owned,5
1332,it costs a little more than others like it but it's a great cable and i've bought and tested many,5
1333,i did not mind because this way i was able to buy 2 sets for christmas presents,5
1334,i just put this on my phone and i love it,5
1335,i've been looking for a case like this one for my tablet,5
1336,i place the speaker phone on my visor so it is always ready to use while it is connected to the speaker,5
1337,update after over a week of use i have not found any cons with this case all pros,5
1338,well made and i have been using it for a couple months and still is in pretty good condition,5
1339,i have been using the case for about two months now and it's fantastic,5
1340,it hooks up my tablet with my tv so i am able to watch movies without having to look down all the time,5
1341,seidio fixed that little oversite by including an adapter so you can use all the galaxy phones with mhl enabled hardware,5
1342,makes a great timer cam and a bunch of other stuff so it can't be dead ever,5
1343,the ball grip that connects the holder to the base of the mount is all that needs to be adjusted,5
1344,not obnoxious and adds a little bit of flair to their phone,5
1345,even though its several months old its still 1 of the best on the market second to only spigen's ultra optics screen protectors,5
1346,phone snaps in nice and snug and it's easy to get the phone in very solid looks very good,5
1347,more importantly it also fits in my backpack nicely so that is also a bonus when working outdoors with the phone near you,5
1348,it adds a small lip to the screen side which will protect the screen from scratches but it will eventually become scratched,5
1349,something to render your phone readily accessible so that you don't need to pay lots of for great quality earbuds,5
1350,this wireless charging feature is a plus i use it to charge my note 2 and get almost three full charges,5
1351,it is sooo nice looking and is very comfortable in my hand and i loved the honeycomb design,5
1352,but once i got it set i have had no problems with cell phone service in my house at all,5
1353,it looks and feels very sturdy and i haven't had any connection issues errors or loss of speed,5
1354,the perfectness of the battery is that it adds very little added weight to the iphone 5,5
1355,i compared the new trent dual usb car charger is a great little charger that performs well as a travel charger,5
1356,i've had one on my phone for about 6 weeks now,5
1357,if i had paid 40 for this i would say it's an improvement over the old otterbox,5
1358,there is plenty of space for cards and cash in the case and i don't have to worry about it slipping and falling out,5
1359,i have the orange one for my iphone 4s and this is so far the best battery i have owned,5
1360,the price made it the best purchase i've made in a long time,5
1361,overall it's a pretty neat device for those who like to have their phone match what they wear everyday like me,5
1362,i bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it,5
1363,i highly recommend this product to anyone who is on the go all day,5
1364,i'm ordering another for the office and one for your suitcase when travel,5
1365,i have had this device a couple of weeks now and i don't see anything wrong with it i really recommend this case,5
1366,bluetooth distance superb so i paired this with my phone and i bought another one for my kid,5
1367,just plugging a device in does not initiate charging you have to press the button to start charging the phone which is fast,5
1368,its got a lot of power and it fits comfortably in my pocket and appears to be very well constructed,5
1369,i accidentally broke the little kick stand the first day i got it 2 little tiny pearls fell of but,5
1370,of course the phone was broke within 2 months but i think that was because i put it on a bit hastily,5
1371,i thought mine was broke but after a little research i found this charger which seemed to fit my needs,5
1372,when it opens from the side it does not get in the way of any buttons nor the qwerty slide,5
1373,it works perfect with my nexus 4 i can put the phone anywhere except in my backpack and it never loses signal,5
1374,i carry two credit cards and my driver's license in the case and cash in your pocket,5
1375,however it fits the moto g perfectly although getting the phone out of the case to charge or use headphones,5
1376,would certainly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality bluetooth speaker,5
1377,this is my 2nd screen protector on my samsung galaxys 4 g so far have had no issues,5
1378,not sure on that but when it's fully charged electronics better watch out,5
1379,so far so good battery works very well i've only had it a couple weeks but no problems so far,5
1380,i love the color and i have dropped the phone a few times and the cover has protected it well,5
1381,negative yes they include a usb to micro-usb cable to charge your headset instead of the proprietary one that comes with it,5
1382,right out of the box it takes some getting used to removing your phone from the sticky backing,5
1383,the only issue i currently have is that i am going to have to down the line since i can be clumsy,5
1384,to switch it on you press and hold a button on the back of it to start recharging,5
1385,no problems pulling the device from my jean pocket with this case on it and not1 scratch or issue with phone,5
1386,the product was shipped quickly and arrived in less than a week well packed and via usps,5
1387,this case is built solid and to me it looks like its going to work fine and i am done thanks and end,5
1388,to wrap up great phone overall and if you are looking for a good screen protector that will last long,5
1389,the rubberized surface for the on off switch and the feel of the phone,5
1390,the battery is better than the one that came with the samsung note phone i just bought,5
1391,then i realised they were to go around the back of my head vs hang rub on my neck,5
1392,of course it adds some bulk but surprisingly it doesn't look like a square garage opene and the shape isn't overwrought,5
1393,oh and the word belkin is inset on the side of the case however the speaker continues to work just fine,5
1394,i recently got my new galaxy sii from t-mobile and this thing worked fine,5
1395,i put the battery on the charger and let it charge for a couple of hours and then synced it up with my iphone 5,5
1396,the droid's sound quality is as good or better than some other plastic flagship devices cough galaxy,5
1397,i knew this was true because when i had plugged it into the wrong usb port or not,5
1398,the front of the case is not flush with the phone which i like,5
1399,that way i can have it in my purse and not have to worry that it will scratch my screen,5
1400,the cable served it's purpose well and it's too bad that meego hasn't taken off,5
1401,the speakers and lighting port on the bottom of the phone bigger to make room for the microphone,5
1402,i have had this cord for a few months now and it is still working,5
1403,i'm using this case on an iphone 5s and it works great holds the phone well,5
1404,it is very comfortable and i sometimes forget that i am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable,5
1405,i also have a slim case on my phone and that tends to make it fall off,5
1406,here is what i have found iphone 5 from 0 % to 100 % almost a full hour quicker than my s3 charger,5
1407,i love my phone and i will always order from here in the future,5
1408,i'm using it to charge my iphone ipad2 ipad mini and i have not had to change the first one yet,5
1409,nice secure fit perfect for galaxy s4 i have for a long time now and randomly came across this one the other day,5
1410,the white one got very dirty very quickly if you are a person who drops their phone allot this otterbox is for you,5
1411,my screen looks just as good as it did the day i bought it,5
1412,that guy must have thought that the case was going to be a hard case but it really isn't,5
1413,also it comes with screen protectors for the front and back so it fully encloses my iphone 5s,5
1414,i have tested a lot of power banks but this one with the read out display is wonderful,5
1415,i keep an extra battery with me and i dont have to take 2 adapters for 2 phones,5
1416,i tested it with my ipad and my iphone and is very nicely constructed,5
1417,high compatibility charges most devices that can be charged via a regular micro usb cable,5
1418,the itorch charges up quickly and was able to charge my samsung galaxy tab 3 8,5
1419,this product worked great and i had no problem with those,5
1420,they all were so inexpensive and so cute but this one by far is the best one that i have ever used,5
1421,i had iphone 4s worked great with that phone just got the iphone 5 and bought to put on and they work very well,5
1422,when your out shopping and you do not want to carry a purse with her credit cards and drivers license,5
1423,will purchase from this seller again when the time comes to replace after expected wear and tear,5
1424,the material is good smudge and fingerprint resistant and i love the matte look and it lets my fingers swipe easily across,5
1425,this beautiful case has a built-in light indicator to show you how much battery life is left in the unit,5
1426,defiantly recommended for you only if you have a samsung galaxy s4 you won't be disappointed with this purchase,5
1427,generally theravpower knightrider 14000mah external batteryis a very good portable power supply that u can take anywhere and charge your phone,5
1428,also i have dropped it a bunch of times and it held up nicely,5
1429,i use to have the same brand of case for my s3 and when i upgraded to the 4s it was no different,5
1430,while colors can vary from monitor to monitor the color of the case i received very closely matched that of the picture,5
1431,the nt81 t charged both of them at the same time when we go on trips,5
1432,my wife and i have been using these for a few months now and no complaints,5
1433,this fit my iphone great and the price was great also it is always nice to have some back up,5
1434,the case is big enough to fit my iphone 5 with the protective otterbox case,5
1435,i've used a lot of bluetooth headsets over the past few years you really do get what you pay for,5
1436,this charger was purchased with the expectation that it would charge my phone quickly and possibly work with my kindle,5
1437,tight fit but not too hard to get on and off but that is an otterbox,5
1438,i have rarely come across anything that will charge my samsung galaxy tab 2 10 34 tablet very well,5
1439,i was happy that all of the buttons are in a recess so no accidental pushing,5
1440,i use this everyday in my car and i haven't had any problems with the case feeling too slippery,5
1441,but it's ok since i didn't buy it there but on amazon,5
1442,it is very easy to simply put the phone in the holder and squeeze the brackets closed,5
1443,i received it really quickly and it was the best decision i've ever made in regards to a smartphone purchase,5
1444,i have had this on my phone for almost a month and it's still kicking,5
1445,in another couple days my front screen is going to be sliding all over the table,5
1446,i updated it to android ice cream sandwich and i don't even need to have an extra charger in my car,5
1447,i've dropped it a few times and nothing happened to my cell or the case,5
1448,everything on the phone can be replaced with another app of your choice to replace how your droid experience is well,5
1449,the case fits the iphone 5c perfectly and includes a built-in screen protector it should be good when dropped,5
1450,all of the buttons work perfectly and the cut-outs are spot on including the one for the isight camera,5
1451,the concept behind this snap on hard shell case for the iphone 5 5s and it is a perfect fit,5
1452,the photos referenced in the review can be located by following customer photo link under the main photo,5
1453,this chager is not long if that is what you are looking for this is a great option,5
1454,this product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative,5
1455,i owned a mophie juice pack for my iphone 4s and my fiance has one for his iphone 5,5
1456,i'm very partial to otterbox when it comes to phone cases and this one was so pretty,5
1457,i have had no problem charging my iphone 5 and an ipod touch as well as a pantech touchscreen phone,5
1458,i'd had a big expensive phone for more than a year and would not be without it,5
1459,this is a great product and if you are looking for a water weatherproof case do not buy this,5
1460,not only that but i suspect that if i were to drop my phone it would protect it just fine,5
1461,the armband is great item to have especially if you have multiple devices that you use this is perfect,5
1462,i only wish they would come out with a waterproof version,5
1463,the dknight magicbox ultra-portable wireless bluetooth speaker is a luxurious piece of heaven to be had,5
1464,the sound quality is very good and the price was even better,5
1465,but i will play with the settings to see if i can get a better seal to block extraneous noise,5
1466,5 mm audio port making it easy to plug in two devices without tangling the cords,5
1467,there is a lip around the front of the phone is left open,5
1468,this screen protector has a nice matte finish that does not interfere with the touch screen,5
1469,the surface has just enough texture to keep the phone from sliding off a desk top or table if bumped,5
1470,it's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the similar-looking nokia mount,5
1471,i charged my bluetooth headphones my iphone and my kindle fire both more than once from this charger,5
1472,this is very well-implemented and easy to use and makes the phone accessible without taking it out of the case,5
1473,i love this little case and i really like the color protects the phone without being bulky,5
1474,i like the feel of it it makes the phone easier to spot in a backpack or purse,5
1475,when i hang out with my buddies at the end of the day and i'll have over 25 %,5
1476,instead of buying a new camera that i was not sure if it would have one and am i glad,5
1477,just as described a replacement extra battery for my phone so i can dress it up like the old barbie dolls,5
1478,it fits well on the phone and has a charging port so you don't have to keep you phone plugged in,5
1479,i never had any issues with otterbox defender cases it really protects your phone i'm gon na order in black next,5
1480,absolute perfect fit and like an earlier reviewer mentioned this is the only type of phone he swears by because of its sleekness,5
1481,he also loves that it is very thin and light while providing superior protection,5
1482,also this is able to charge my ipad mini and my iphone 4s together in about 8,5
1483,also happy to report after she dropped the phone in the toilet and it shorted the usb port,5
1484,this really isn't an issue if you plan to use a screen protector get a case-friendly one,5
1485,this is also an incredible feature if you use your phone for things like watching video reading documents and such,5
1486,the best part is that it can be used with or without the case,5
1487,this company has outstanding reviews and that is why i purchased a voyage legend,5
1488,i am happy with the case and would highly recommend it to you,5
1489,having said that this is the best phone on the market except for the large note type phones,5
1490,i have no interests financial or otherwise in the manufacturer its employees or suppliers,5
1491,why would anybody complain about it when the product is exactly as described cheaper from the company website,5
1492,i have a very slim case on my phone and that's a plus for me,5
1493,i bought this product for backup for my cell phone i'm not very good at putting these things on,5
1494,these are by far the best case for the money that i have seen,5
1495,99 and it isn't nearly as bulky as otter boxes,5
1496,i love that i can use it to listen to music since my car is not bluetooth enabled,5
1497,i would buy one myself if they came out with a new version of the 510,5
1498,i do love this one because it does what it says it should do and i'm all about that,5
1499,the cable is thin enough so it takes up little space in my carry on bag or tote bag,5
1500,with a little patience and a fingernail i finally got it open and got my phone inside and it works perfectly,5
1501,and in practice as i own an iphone 5s i don't use it but may in the future,5
1502,i'll update my review if i notice anything else but at this point i would not hesitate to recommend this product,5
1503,the one thing i don't really care for about this battery is that it was much cheaper than even the regular battery,5
1504,so i'm thinking you can get 2 1 2 charges out of my galaxy note 3 and it was a great choice,5
1505,no complaints and i would recommend it to anyone who loves cases like these,5
1506,he works in construction and needed something that would protect his phone from all that and look good,5
1507,need to use provided otg cable unit also has over-charge protection which stops supplying current once the battery is full,5
1508,and very easy to use and easy to get used to,5
1509,both can be used for what ever you want but overall it is a very nice product in terms of build and reliability,5
1510,i am attaching a collage of several photos which can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo,5
1511,but i like the fact that the fosmon screen protector is anti-glare and does it's job once applied,5
1512,it fits the phone well and i am pleased with the phone and 4 g service from verizon,5
1513,the case is fairly unobtrusive and shows off the phone which is what i was looking for in a iphone case,5
1514,i purchased several cases for my note 3 but this one was by far the best in terms of performance and durability,5
1515,as for the fit of the headset it is very secure on my arm and on the phone,5
1516,it holds the phone very securely and i dont have any problems with them whil moving around,5
1517,i been using this battery for about a month and have been very happy with it including the price vs,5
1518,i am constantly on my electronics and playing games and this device is perfect for keeping my small devices like my itouch powered up,5
1519,i have had the 9250 nexus phone for a few years now which finally started having issues,5
1520,i would highly recommend this car charger to anyone who wants to be able to see the usb slot,5
1521,i inserted and removed the phone a dozen times and it did crack or anything i love it,5
1522,it's sleek and about the size of a normal persons pinky finger,5
1523,the leather back case is by far the best for 3 reasons 1,5
1524,i received no compensation and this review is my honest unbiased and fair review,5
1525,the case offers decent protection too i dropped my phone the other day and it didn't even scratch the rubber surface,5
1526,perfect fit for my iphone 4s and i don't feel it i do not use a case,5
1527,i had major issues with the other case i decided to give this one a go and i'm glad i did,5
1528,if you hold the power button for a few seconds and it starts charging the iphone,5
1529,very comfortable used it right out of the box and then started using it,5
1530,it is perfect for users that have many devices that need to be recharged on a regular basis,5
1531,cons only thing i could possibly think of would be that the holster belt clip isn't adjustable,5
1532,its something about the design of the curves on the back of the device showed 1 out of 4 lights,5
1533,it is snug stays put although i have only had it for a week now and it does hold more charge,5
1534,i charged my iphone at the same time while i travelled,5
1535,the one other great thing about this case is that it gets dirty but what do you expect from a rear speaker,5
1536,that is ideal for charging two tablets at the same time it will protect your phone,5
1537,1a for ipads and larger devices and the other is a 5v 1a charge for most other devices,5
1538,a soft muted white led in the headset flashes to let you know it's got power so be aware of that,5
1539,this round i was looking for something rugged so i do not have to worry about carrying the phone in my hand,5
1540,when i received my free sample for review i plugged it in to charge and it was completely charged again within two hours,5
1541,it doesn't feel cheap at all and it's perfect because it protects well and does not add much bulk,5
1542,this is a huge plus and i like the fact that the ma rating is next to each usb outlet,5
1543,so if you're looking for a power bank that you can carry in your pocket i don't see much value to,5
1544,it was bright outdoors had to crank the brightness all the way up and i've been running videos and music,5
1545,the slim armor case is easy to install and protects the phone great,5
1546,it also easy to get the case on and off but it doesn't bother me to walk around with it,5
1547,the case also comes with a screen protector as a bonus,5
1548,and also it is made by samsung so it is not one of those ugly mega phone cases i hate,5
1549,i love the feel look fit and finish of this case is really exceptional for the money,5
1550,pros it is slim and light without adding too much bulk to the phone like my son's otterbox,5
1551,it's durable holster securely holds my phone and the kickstand is just a bonus for the case it is not cheap,5
1552,though i did misalign hers on my first try i was still able to pull the phone holder out of the cd slot,5
1553,the audio cord is only about 6 inches long which is longer than the phone itself,5
1554,i got the white one and i was pleasantly surprised when i put it on my phone i got a lot of compliments about them,5
1555,this case is awesome it fits the phone well and has easy grip on the sides so the phone edges its way out,5
1556,ihave bought 3-4 of these keep them all over the house and work so you always have one accessable,5
1557,the dual ports are great able to charge my iphone and ipad by using this cable when connected to a pc,5
1558,the color is nice the holes are in the right places permitting usage for all phone functions,5
1559,btw i do get many compliments on it and i would definitely recommend because of its performance and price,5
1560,it looks very nice and fits the phone perfectly i don't know what else to say about them,5
1561,easy to install just like any other screen protector i've ever used,5
1562,the edges are beveled a feature that makes it easier to hold onto the phone with some extra size,5
1563,we've used it a few times and for the price it does the job very well,5
1564,not the best quality of sound but for the price you cant go wrong with zagg,5
1565,bought a bunch for everyone in the family as well as other devices that i own owned,5
1566,the product was shipped quickly and arrived in less than a week well packed and via usps,5
1567,it gets a little warm but that's to be expected with this type of case,5
1568,i tested this on my apple wall charger block to charge my iphone 4s and ipad 4th gen over the few days,5
1569,would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot on screen protectors,5
1570,i wanted to get a bluetooth so i can listen to music audio books or make calls,5
1571,i got this case for my work phone and this fit the bill perfectly for a great price,5
1572,5 x 2 x 1 this compact wall charger is one of the best chargers for your car out there,5
1573,photo 2 shows the top of the unit which shows you how much charge is left on it,5
1574,if you want to protect your new iphone 5 but you don't want the plastic where you grip the phone,5
1575,quality is excellent and people on the other end can hear me clearly and vice versa,5
1576,i have a car charger as well but there are times when i found myself missing the stylus from my old palm,5
1577,used it for a day now and it doesn't collect fingerprints like the glossy kind of cases do,5
1578,i still can't believe i have a screen protector on it too prevent scratches,5
1579,i ordered this case for both my phone and my daughter's android tablet without slowing down the charging time,5
1580,the only thing is they're just a little short for me but i'm a bigger guy,5
1581,i have had in for a few months now and have had no problems,5
1582,secondly i really like the look of the phone in this case but it does increase the weight,5
1583,the mini side metal part is long enough that my phone is within easy reach and view,5
1584,if you're considering buying this product just note that i was able to find their products for my new phone,5
1585,this became a problem because in my state just passed a no cell phone talking while driving except with bluetooth or speakers,5
1586,the only down side is that you have to push a little harder but for the price it is well worth the hassle,5
1587,when i realized this was a perfect fit for my iphone 5 and have gotten many compliments,5
1588,this was great charged quickly and didn't have any issues with my ipad 2 and iphone 5s simutaneously,5
1589,given my activities i prefer theotterbox defender series case for iphone 5 retail packaging black but slightly more light-weight,5
1590,i was a little skeptical because of the price but i'm glad i bought it,5
1591,this device comes with a micro-usb to usb cable for charging,5
1592,have had it about a month now and am still on the first one out of the set,5
1593,a small detail that i like about it is that it slips out of my hands easily,5
1594,it's slim enough that it slides in and out of your pockets with ease and wont slide around in the car,5
1595,i have one on my iphone and i love it just as much as i do,5
1596,i have charged my wife's iphone 5 and they are as good if not better than the original samsung battery,5
1597,those jaws are released by one small button on the side of the electron a digital display comes on,5
1598,the color was just as pictured and it fit my phone perfectly iphone4 i love this case,5
1599,it outputs 720p in my phone not sure if it's a new process or material but i love it,5
1600,i ordered this case because i had the same case for my iphone 4 and didnt want to change,5
1601,i will list the possible reasons below you are on the road a lot and their devices start to run low on charge,5
1602,i just received this in the mail and it's a very nice calming color,5
1603,i used it again to fully charge my phone from 1 % to 28 % on the third attempt,5
1604,i was looking for a car charger for my iphone in my car is ok but not ideal,5
1605,first of all i have to say i love this case,5
1606,great little charger the end is small enough to still be able to touch the screen and control the phone,5
1607,the primary attribute i was looking for was a silicon case but when it got here i was very satisfied,5
1608,have had one on my phone for about 6 weeks now,5
1609,i have dropped the phone a few times and i have only had it for a day or two,5
1610,battery life indicator case is easy to put on and seems to be a great product,5
1611,they kinda scratch easy but i don't mind i knew this would happen,5
1612,it gives you a much better grip on thegalaxy s4 and i would recommend this for anyone who has a phone that it will fit,5
1613,they work great for calls sound wonderful with music were easy to connect to my iphone and it is loud and easy to undestand,5
1614,it's still got enough to charge an ipad 2 almost three full times,5
1615,i carry it in my backpack and it allows me to charge my ipad and iphone on one outlet,5
1616,i received this unit for free in exchange for a fair and honest review,5
1617,i couldn't be happier with this product and it was exactly as described and came to my po box as promised,5
1618,this stylus packs what you need when it comes to buying a charger,5
1619,it provides extra protection when slipping the phone into my pocket which is a big plus,5
1620,not only can it charge tow devices at the same time but it takes a little bit longer,5
1621,i'm super happy and my screen looks like there is nothing there it still has all the brightness and colors,5
1622,it is well made and is just as good as the one that came with my phone,5
1623,but it's not too difficult to get the phone on and off even with my slim case,5
1624,these items arrived before estimated arrival and i am very happy with the purchased of the hyperion extended battery,5
1625,i use it for my iphone 4s and kindle fire at the same time fast with easy,5
1626,i have been using it for about 2 weeks and it's been great,5
1627,i only recently purchased my first new trent dual port high speed wall charger rated at 2,5
1628,who wants to worry about charging up if you are stuck in an airport or just want to charge it at work,5
1629,i suspect this will loosen the more i use the phone the more i like it,5
1630,each of these batteries work at least as long as the oem battery maybe marginally longer,5
1631,i like the charging and the fact that i can have it white to match my samsung phone,5
1632,in daily use this hasn't been a problem for me so far,5
1633,that one stayed on for a long time and protects the phone it came with what it said and looked like it says,5
1634,after a short tutorial she was able to charge the unit and use a headphone without taking the case off,5
1635,these cables are rock solid and definitely a great choice if you're serious about protecting your device,5
1636,i would recommend the product and vendor to anyone that asks me and the price was great,5
1637,with my old band i would have to take the case off when i have to plug it in at the end of the day,5
1638,i really like the fact that it doesn't make your phone bulky,5
1639,the bass isn't deep and doesn't seem to have any processor induced lag at all,5
1640,the only thing i can think of is i haven't had any problems with it so far,5
1641,i would highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a replacement charger or just need a longer cord,5
1642,this is by far the best case that i have bought for my iphone since i got it,5
1643,keeps the phone slim and has a great feel in your hand feels solid and not cheesy,5
1644,sent it back and ordered another one of these for the house as well,5
1645,the cord is exactly what i was looking for and for a good price as i did,5
1646,this thing fits perfectly all the holes are in the right places to include the microphone holes,5
1647,i ordered this case mostly because the price was so low how can you go wrong,5
1648,i have had this battery for a week now and all i can say is you get what you pay for,5
1649,this car mount is the best i've ever seen from any screen protector,5
1650,the back is raised enough to where you dont have to worry if the battery pack can handle ypur devices,5
1651,the price was great the cover is really cute and it protected my phone very well great perfect fit and design,5
1652,it holds my phone and keys while i go for a walk or do something that could cause damage to the phone,5
1653,had no issues installing screen protector and installed it is almost impossible to see to answer a call or to place a call,5
1654,i tried several inane tricks including attempting to install the protector in the bathroom after someone takes a hot shower,5
1655,and it fits my samsung galaxy s4 perfectly and was easy to put the phone on,5
1656,1 galaxy note 2 at the same time and it's oem,5
1657,i got the droid 3 when it first came out and was happy with the oem battery capacity,5
1658,well worth the price i liked them so much i purchased a second one for my husband,5
1659,plus with the screen protector i don't have to worry about scratching or dropping my new phone,5
1660,if you charge two devices at once which is a nice feature if you have a tight space to deal with,5
1661,the mirror is way better than a regular protector and is very handy when you want to walk around with your phone,5
1662,the 510 connects seamlessly with my iphone via bluetooth and i have had no problems at all and now his cell is always charged,5
1663,the flexible rubber material makes it extremely easy to put on and the edges don't curl,5
1664,audio to user's ear is not as clear as i would like it to be even louder,5
1665,i got so many compliments on it and sound quality is very good for it's size price,5
1666,however after having it for a week i must admit that i am partial to behind the ear type,5
1667,the good its hard to find a screen protector that does not appear to be there at all,5
1668,it protects everything but the bezel which i can't see how you could damage your phone with this case on it inside another case,5
1669,it easily cut through the ambient shower noise and i was able to enjoy the clear sound and great bluetooth connection,5
1670,he was very pleased with the quality of the phone i just bought,5
1671,the screen protector was easy to apply and was able to use my phone while it's charging,5
1672,pretty pissed that this was happening but not a big deal since i dont really use it for phone calls,5
1673,the inclusion of iphone adapter is very convenient for those of us who constantly lose or misplace accessories like that,5
1674,it's cool that i can charge not only my phone but my dad 8217s phone too,5
1675,update so mine stopped working after a couple of months and then i upgraded to the pro plus,5
1676,the lip around the front glass allows me to turn the phone so that the face is towards the holster,5
1677,this phone comes already unlocked from the provider and you don't have to poke with it or jam it down,5
1678,i can't even tell you how many times i've had earphones snatched out of my ears ow,5
1679,one minor thing is that the suction is so strong it works without locking it in,5
1680,what sets it apart from the other chargers it has a built-in light and two volume buttons which are pretty small but usable,5
1681,this was a gift for my daughter who wanted a touch phone,5
1682,i wish belkin made this for my galaxy note 2 it works wonderfully great,5
1683,the qi charger from ravpower is just as good if not better than the otterbox it replaced,5
1684,i've been using this charger for a year and it works flawlessly,5
1685,mounting position was very important in order for the person on the other end without having to smash the bluetooth into my ear,5
1686,the item came on time and the price was good i would buy it again if i needed another one,5
1687,it's simple and provides a good grip of the phone just what i was looking for,5
1688,my requirement for a great screen protector is something that's going to protect your phone all that well though,5
1689,also it slides in and out of my pockets and get some scratches dents,5
1690,it's not too bulky but it protects the phone and i love having my cards in there,5
1691,all in all a good product for the price and give production output,5
1692,i have had this phone case on my phone for a dressy date or nice event,5
1693,it has these grippers on the side so you can turn it into a stand,5
1694,i love this case just the same as what you pay twice as much for at stores or cell phone outlets,5
1695,the powerbank has a micro usb charging port on the bottom of the phone so your phone actually has a shelf to sit on,5
1696,i love this and it is great to have a fully charged battery at work if necessary,5
1697,i was a little skeptical about trying this speaker but i'm glad i didn't take it off by accident,5
1698,by the way it fits great with that screen protector so i don't have to dig around for the stylus in your purse,5
1699,if you use the speaker during a phone call people on the other end have said it has good clear quality when i talk,5
1700,i purchased a case that came with a screen protector which was not mentioned in the product details,5
1701,looks very similar to a pmag and the color is a little darker than the picture but i bought it for my mom,5
1702,with the introduction of the lightning port it makes it much easier to change the volume take pictures lock my screen etc,5
1703,operation is easy and straightforward 8211 just connect the device you want to recharge and turn the power bank on,5
1704,i have never has a problem and i have used them for other phones i have had since,5
1705,would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive case for my new droid dna,5
1706,if i'm gon na be away from an outlet for a long time and uses their phone often,5
1707,this phone is usually at 60-70 % battery at the end of the day this is a business tool,5
1708,i'm more likely to use my phone as a mirror,5
1709,just as described and much better than the one i have at home that i paid 150,5
1710,it's indeed a speedy charger and the fact that it allows me to be comfortable using it in the field,5
1711,it picked up a lot more stations than i thought it would and much better than the ol cheapy ones i bought,5
1712,i may start setting it down on the screen side to avoid potential heartache,5
1713,i'm very happy i don't have to take the case off for it to plug in,5
1714,there's a lip around the screen so you can lay it face down,5
1715,took a chance on this case and i am happy that i purchased it,5
1716,it also includes a mic so that you can use the stylus for years to come,5
1717,i think it gets a little louder than the only other bluetooth speaker i've ever used is theplantronics k100 bluetooth speakerphone,5
1718,well made just had it for a week but it seems very durable,5
1719,will perform like zagg no but for the price it does a great job of it too,5
1720,it comes with a dashboard mount disk if you don't want to take your wallet or purse,5
1721,it's been on my phone for about 3 weeks now and i am very pleased with my purchase,5
1722,i can not speak to it messing up the screen protector as i don't think the other one would have worked at all,5
1723,of course i ordered a replacement for the one that came with my tablet,5
1724,i would recommend this case if you are looking for a great phone case look no further,5
1725,the first i had was the one that came with the phone and they are awesome,5
1726,does everything the big names do at a fraction of the cost of some of the others i tried,5
1727,my favorite part is how you turn it on and off regardless of the song volume you set,5
1728,and this is one of the nicer ones i've received,5
1729,when i got the set i was surprised at how small it was no bigger than my thumb,5
1730,i did not look for a whole lot of protection but it fits well and looks nice,5
1731,i purchased this as a christmas gift for my dad and he loved it,5
1732,overall i am happy with my order and i would recommend to anyone to who has a smartphone to use it,5
1733,i just received my case and i like it a-lot,5
1734,this is a durable case that goes on easily and fits perfectly but can be removed quickly if necessary,5
1735,phone snaps in nice and snug and it's not hard to put on,5
1736,it comes with two usb ports so you can charge two devices at 1 amp or one at 2,5
1737,the camera cut-out on the back of the case and i love it,5
1738,they are thin and i can charge my phone from 20 % to 65 %,5
1739,i rushed over made the trade and i wake up the next day and bam my phone has a full battery,5
1740,not to slick not to sticky slides in and out of my pocket coat car cradle and more,5
1741,i ordered this for my daughter's iphone 5 at a great price and it is doing the job it was designed to do,5
1742,it is nicely weighted so it feels comfortable in the hand and it is tightly fitted so it should protect the phone from small drops,5
1743,i would recommend this case to anyone looking for a slim and head turner water proof case,5
1744,i also was forced to keep popping my phone out of its case and put it in the water for overnight,5
1745,i am a slim case lover but this one is one of the better parts i've used,5
1746,cons the phone won't fit in my armband as is,5
1747,i use this in my car and it allows me to have backup chargers just in case,5
1748,this is the fastest and smoothest phone i have ever owned and i have the oem apple earphones,5
1749,still i think it's a great case with good protection and a great feel get this case,5
1750,the case is thick enough to protect the screen but not so much to get on the way,5
1751,i do have to say that i would not have to purchase this cutter,5
1752,these batteries in my opinion are the best you can get and don't mind the bulk otherwise look elsewhere,5
1753,i like the way the phone easily slips in and out of the pocket easily sturdy and generally well-made,5
1754,this one fits a little looser but i think that is a plus because they won't disconnect,5
1755,i have bought many cases for my iphone 5 but i didn't want to take a chance,5
1756,update i've had this phone for a week now and i wouldn't use any other case,5
1757,what i really like most about it is that it's small and light,5
1758,i am an htc one x user and i can honestly say that these are the nicest screen protectors i've ever used,5
1759,features are similar as well as the sound as far as i can tell it's only for android phones,5
1760,thus far we are very happy with this product and it was exactly as described and would tell others about it it awesome,5
1761,to release the phone you just depress the two buttons on the side and your phone is instantly released,5
1762,it does add significant bulk to the iphoneoverall i've been using this case for a couple of months now,5
1763,i have to say that i am very pleased with this screen protector does a great job,5
1764,the color is very bright and makes it easier to find in my purse or briefcase,5
1765,both devices can be connected at the same time such as a cell phone ipad and bluetooth zomm,5
1766,when i need to go and don't want to carry a purse while shopping or running on a quick errand,5
1767,kept my phone protected very strong and sturdy i dropped it a few times and it hasn't even made a dent in it,5
1768,comes with 5 for a great price and you will be amazed how much you use it,5
1769,i always have my phone with me and my phone is rarely charging thanks to the extra charger,5
1770,whole install process took about 30 seconds i've been using screen protectors on all of my iphones and really liked all of them,5
1771,i have used bluetooth headsets in the past but this is worth it,5
1772,i decided this morning that i would write a review for the case i've bought for my new phone and i just love it,5
1773,its the mosy durable case i have ever owned and that is saying something,5
1774,i would purchase this item again and i would recommend it to other friend who is using s3,5
1775,i've been using this with a samsung galaxy s4 and my hp touchpad yes i still use it,5
1776,i like to listen to music when i am at work and have the ability to charge it in my pc,5
1777,easier to find and see in the car when i need to be plugged into power,5
1778,they are so soft and flexible that i can use any of my headphones and make them wireless,5
1779,if your a professional on the road all the time for work and personal uses,5
1780,however seller included tool and replace the back of the iphone is not very visible on black iphone 5,5
1781,the touch screen is very easy to use and holds more than enough power for a full day of high phone usage,5
1782,this case is very nice i love the way that it fits on my galaxy note 2,5
1783,where you see white spots use the included microfiber cloth to get rid of any dust particles that end up under the screen protector,5
1784,this was very easy to travel with and slipped easily in and out of my pockets while covered with this double outershell,5
1785,it slides off easily but i have dropped my phone on cement and it landed face down,5
1786,all in all this is a great cover and it meets all my needs and then some,5
1787,thanks so much i love the price of the case and i love it it came quick and it looks so nice on my phone,5
1788,do not waste your time and or money on any other screen protector for your ipod touch 5,5
1789,awesome case for a fraction of the price i would have had to pay 40 for on the website,5
1790,my old one lasted a few years and i'm very happy with it overall,5
1791,great case for everyday use not too complicated and does add some protection to the back as well but none to the sides,5
1792,both batteries worked fine and the charger worked after i figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back,5
1793,it didn't seem to matter whether i had it plugged into a usb port with a retractable usb micro cable,5
1794,it's been a year with this holster now and i can't believe how good this case is and how inexpensive it is,5
1795,i am not sure since i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's mother,5
1796,the film does not interfere with the use of the buttons on the side worked with no problem,5
1797,it fits great on her iphone and protects well would recommend to anyone looking for cheap reliable protection for their device,5
1798,i would recommend this to anyone with a device that uses a usb 3,5
1799,one time i ordered a 30-pin cable for my first generation ipad and was satisfied with the steady boost of power,5
1800,i have never been crazy about the wrap around the back of the head band interferes with any coat collar i am wearing,5
1801,i gave it a good workout charging my kindle fire hd 7 34 to listen to music wirelessly,5
1802,i've had it for months now and it is still going strong no issues at all,5
1803,voila thats just what i wanted i work in a place where there is no dust mmmmm,5
1804,the unit itself is heavier than i thought it would be it measures 4 x 2 and almost 3 4 thick,5
1805,the blackberry came as said and i am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to my friends,5
1806,first impressions look a lot better than the ones that don't have a cord attached,5
1807,i like the feel of the matte finish was strange but after a couple of days it's now just as smooth as the glass,5
1808,putting on the eartip cover was tough because it's a tight fit to to get the usb into the phone,5
1809,the oxa 4 port usb charger does exactly what it says it does love it i am going to order another,5
1810,if you got a 5c and you want to take advantage of the technology bluetooth has to offer,5
1811,i need to mention i have an otter box case on my phone and the charger works right through it,5
1812,the remote is very convenient when you don't want to be ripping it off and on,5
1813,the case is a definite bonus and i think it will protect your phone from scratches and minor falls,5
1814,i normally use the external battery packs to charge my phone but this is so convenient,5
1815,i originally got an incipio case when i got the phone but soon after they decided to make the case,5
1816,i have only had it a week but so far it's done what it says,5
1817,i bought the black and green one and liked it so much that i bought their ipad version for my new ipad air,5
1818,but for now i am very pleased with my purchase and will be using ballistic cases for my future phone cases,5
1819,luckily it fits the phone even with the case on the phone it will close the gap,5
1820,the construction is solid so you don't have to buy a case or cover for your phone,5
1821,the only issue i have with this case and it is not an easy task to accomplish in this case category,5
1822,i am extrememly happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who owns a motorola atrix phone,5
1823,huge bonus that it charges via micro usb so you can use the non-standard usb cable your sony camera e,5
1824,this is not an issue for me as i have a charger in my kitchen as well as in my bedroom very handy,5
1825,love it it looks great on my phone it is also very easy to wipe on your shirt and clean,5
1826,and since i dislike carrying a purse i love the fact that i am not afraid to crack the screen,5
1827,now that i own the droid razr maxx i decided to get the same battery for my galaxy note ii,5
1828,after shattering my iphone screen i wanted a case with a few little pockets and it has them,5
1829,bought this so i could carry it in my bag and i can charge my iphone 5s 3,5
1830,i charged my kindle fire hd my iflash 4400 mah power bank at the same time so each one always stays fully charged as well,5
1831,it does what it's advertised to do and it does it quickly and seamlessly,5
1832,seems to protect okay i dropped my phone a couple of times and it still worked perfectly,5
1833,it fits my phone perfect and it was better than i thought so i recommend you buy one or more,5
1834,i threw it on the floor then dropped it into a sink full of water to see if it really is waterproof,5
1835,they are cut to exactly fit my galaxy s3 and i'm using it in my car and havent had any problems with case,5
1836,it is cheap works perfectly and is a great size so you can take this speaker anywhere,5
1837,bluetooth gets better all the time and i don't have to worry about it falling and dropping my brand new galaxy s4,5
1838,i ordered this for my iphone 5 and it works like a charm,5
1839,this case is exactly what i was looking for to use with my iphone 4s and ipad and found that it quickly recharges both,5
1840,but it did take a long time for it to come yeah me,5
1841,the reason for the smaller protector size is due to the fact that all five ports are universal,5
1842,i'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive phone holder,5
1843,if you have a 16 gb or 32 gb micro sd card and a usb reader combination,5
1844,don't buy it if you're prone to dropping your phone a lot then get a more heavy duty case,5
1845,i love this screen i like it because you don't have to charge the darn thing,5
1846,it was able to charge my droid dna at about 1 % per minute and the power bank never went dead,5
1847,i would never intentionally drop the phone in this case it will be protected,5
1848,and as for this anker walkpower i'll be buying another one the same exact one lol,5
1849,if it weren't for having this i would not be able to call anyone because i don't have my phone in the mount,5
1850,when i ordered this to use with my iphone 4s with an otterbox case ipod and nexus 4,5
1851,this process makes sure that no air gets trapped in the center of the protector and it pretty much adheres itself,5
1852,i can not have a cover on my phone and it fit very well,5
1853,in its natural landscape orientation you would not be able to get one to fit the note 3,5
1854,i've had cell phones for over 30 years and i must say this is by far the best and most reliable one,5
1855,but i have a dry bag for that when my phone is in the dock it looks like part of the car,5
1856,these days you really do have to keep track of the adapter for my 2,5
1857,very nice quality dual port high current charger for a very reasonable price i will recommend it to anyone interested,5
1858,the only downside to the pack is that it doesn't come in the iphone 4 size so that sucks,5
1859,the equalizer has a number of pre-sets and gives you the ability to still use it while protecting it,5
1860,the inside is also very well made as long as you don't touch the back sticky part they can be reused,5
1861,reaching buttons are intuitive and you don't have to cut it and piece it in there,5
1862,still it is small lightweight and portable and does a great job of allowing for four items to charge simultaneously,5
1863,definitely look into getting this bad boy if you are in need of an amazing speaker i highly recommend you get this for your phone,5
1864,i paired it with an iphone4 all you have to do is hit the button located on the headset handle,5
1865,i ordered this hoping it would work for my nexus 4 and it didn't let me down,5
1866,i've used other cases but this is the one i use on my tablet and have reviewed it as well,5
1867,very well made actually kind of hard to get on and off but snug enough that it doesn't fall off,5
1868,but to my surprise it held is so well that i had to get a new headset is because it was physically damaged,5
1869,i've had the case for a few weeks now and noticed no drop in quality,5
1870,for a man this is important because you don't feel like you are going to drop it like the slippery di tronic,5
1871,also it look really good from what i've been told and read it takes about 3 hours to fully charged from 0 %,5
1872,it is a great product and i would recommend to everyone,5
1873,the ability to leave my mp3 music cell phone in my gym bag and walked over 20 feet away never lost the connection,5
1874,this wall charger does exactly what it says it can do,5
1875,not a scratch or scuff and i've had this for a while and it still reported 1 cent per hour,5
1876,it was a perfect fit for my samsung galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy tab 2 10,5
1877,overall it looks like i could get nearly two full charges on my iphone 5s while constantly using the phone as well,5
1878,unlike those other rubber tipped styli i bought a long time ago but they did fit perfectly and held up well,5
1879,great case i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for any kind of protection for their phone,5
1880,and with the usb and micro-usb ports it will charge just about any device that has a usb cable,5
1881,i also love the fact that this can also plug into a wall outlet via an ac adapter not included,5
1882,they paired up with her iphone without any issues and without a lot of fuss or headaches like other bluetooth solutions i've tried,5
1883,i like that it's easy on and off i found the buttons are hard to press at first but you get used to it,5
1884,it got here quickly and it protects the phone very well and looks good while doing so,5
1885,shortly after receiving the charger in the mail my wife and i needed to charge both our phones at once,5
1886,the magnet is stronger than most would assume but if you have a thick case it might not reach the contacts,5
1887,i am very satisfied with this case and i don't see why anyone can complain about it,5
1888,the only thing is they're just a little short for me but i'm a bigger guy,5
1889,this mount holder can fit many sized phones and i don't have to carry around a compact i just use my phone,5
1890,have dropped my phone numerous times on concrete and the phone is fine and the case isn't even scratched,5
1891,update i've had this for well over a year and still no problems with any of them,5
1892,i've used a plantronics discovery 925 bluetooth for the last four years and i won't buy anything else,5
1893,you do have to hold the button down for a few seconds and bam it began to charge,5
1894,true it's not water proof and this model is difficult to remove but that's good i don't want it to budget,5
1895,it is not as bulky as the otterbox so you don't lose the slimness of the phone,5
1896,it looked exactly like it did online when i got it and it was worth the long wait for shipping,5
1897,if it weren't for having this i would not be able to use the original jabra charger with this setup,5
1898,it has 4 hours of talk time which is a big plus for me,5
1899,below you will find my review of the aero wireless charging battery case to test and review by unu,5
1900,it charged up my cell phone and will be using this in the car and need as few additional hassles as possible,5
1901,i live off battery packs as i use my phone a lot so it's battery is near death a lot,5
1902,i just plug them in when i go to bed and forget i have them on,5
1903,i liked the feel of it so much that i ordered a set for my father,5
1904,this all took a little getting used to but once you got it charges great,5
1905,i have big hands and i've found these to be the best use em everyday lightweight and incredible battery life,5
1906,all the ports can be easily accessed and the case was easy to put on my phone just slid right into it,5
1907,it comes with a detachable lightning cable so you can use it for your ipad i suppose,5
1908,this also has a wrap around micro usb cable that stores on the charger is a thick piece of rubber,5
1909,this battery pack works great it's one of the best sounding devices i've ever owned and i have a canon digital slr too,5
1910,doesnt add to much bulk and is very easy to take off which i believe is a negative feature,5
1911,much better than my skyrocket but i knew it would be because its not a rubber case,5
1912,unbelievable it just diappears and you can't even tell there's a cover protective skin on my phone,5
1913,if you have any specific questions please feel free to ask i'm constantly checking this thread,5
1914,im happy with the case and it does not bother me one bit,5
1915,this product is worth the money and i would recommend these to anyone who wants quality sound,5
1916,1a usb car charger for a while now and i am really impressed with the quality of this product,5
1917,he's had it a couple months now and it has held up well,5
1918,the second thing i like is the fact that i can charge two iphone's from this charger at once,5
1919,it plays really well worth the money spent i would recommend it to anyone who's a user of ram mount products,5
1920,the buttons power and volume don't protrude enough to make it easy to see where you stand charge-wise,5
1921,i have it on my phone and i was looking for something with a similar texture,5
1922,my two year old has thrown and dropped my phone numerous times and its seems to protect it,5
1923,i got one for myself and my daughter and son-in-law to use while running he loves it,5
1924,i have a habit of setting the phone on my lap while driving and have a hands free phone conversation,5
1925,slim design i like the fact that it does not have the kick stand on the back,5
1926,i love it and i am going to buy more for my bestie when i can,5
1927,i know for a fact that there is no way to set it to default save to gmail,5
1928,it takes about two hours for the battery to charge but it works well,5
1929,kind of like this because it is easy to insert and remove but stays firmly in place,5
1930,while easily slipped into a front jeans pocket it's a breeze to slip on and no bubbles with minimum effort,5
1931,i've applied screen protectors on many devices over the years and have generally been very pleased with both the value and quality,5
1932,flexibility is a real selling point i love being able to use this bluetooth headset and have my hands free,5
1933,my old one lasted a few years and i'm very happy with it,5
1934,as a experiment i tried using three fingers and i was still able to hear the movie without blasting the volume,5
1935,-the 8 mp camera is one of the best phone cases i have used,5
1936,i use it back and forth from my living room to the kitchen and the sound was not distorted,5
1937,i am using this speaker on a samsung galaxy s4 and a motorola droid razr maxx hd and a verizon hotspot for over a day,5
1938,she loves that it covers the front of the phone slightly elevated as well,5
1939,it was nice but it added a lot of bulk to my phone i like that a lot,5
1940,i have 3 of these cables and this one by far is the most impressive screen protector i've ever used,5
1941,the pen twists for the pen to appear on the opposite end of the cable to connect to the bracelet,5
1942,as a compulsive phone-checker this is a great thing to say for a case with this affordable price,5
1943,also love that you can see the back of the phone with this 1x1 inch sticky cleaning pad,5
1944,i bought it for my htc-hd2 and it fits like a glove love the design on it and the colors,5
1945,super slim so it doesn't take away from the look of the item,5
1946,these came in handy as i have had my phone for a week and it has made my use of time much more efficient,5
1947,i like this case because it protects my phone and makes it looks nice,5
1948,it's also a very nice car charger with an extra usb port for an additional 200 mah,5
1949,i love this case it's sleek and the buttons are easy to press though an improvement over my old t616,5
1950,this was preform cut so it fit my iphone 5 perfectly with one snap it was on,5
1951,34 three inches can be just as good as the one that came with your iphone or your jambox,5
1952,the batteries work just as well as the ones from store,5
1953,i gave one to my daughter and she has dropped her phone like a hundred times and nothing,5
1954,it only slightly changes the screen feeling but i haven't noticed any problems with thes pen yet,5
1955,i have tried a lot of different cases for my iphones over the years but i think i like this nt120 t better,5
1956,i've never been able to get the right one to fit your phone they are all different,5
1957,i almost wish they would have centered it in the middle of the bed while charging the phone without pulling the cord out,5
1958,everyone that has seen it thinks it is a great cover for iphone owners with small children,5
1959,the batteries so far seem to discharge at about the same rate as using the normal apple charging cord,5
1960,it works great and it is nice to have a case that could do both portrait and landscape,5
1961,samsung makes a great product and i would recommend it to my friends,5
1962,the brightly colored cable makes it easy to find when i toss it in my messenger bag,5
1963,but man it took me three tries to figure out what to do with all of them,5
1964,i have the blue galaxy s4 active phone so i was looking for a hard case that not a lot of people had,5
1965,got this when i got my phone and i couldn't find one within 50 miles,5
1966,granted i've never dropped my phone with this case on a few times and it's never cracked and my phone is fine,5
1967,i bought some for myself and i'm going to buy another one if anything happened to it,5
1968,the iphone 5 fits perfectly and it's easy to get in and out even with my diztronic form fitting case on it,5
1969,i bought it for my daughter over a year ago and she still has it on her phone,5
1970,the only thing that some people might not like is that it's short,5
1971,each port is the same output so you don't have to cut them down to fit your phone great quality too,5
1972,they work quite well as long as you don't demand ultimate perfection,5
1973,as for apps they keep coming every day and i don't feel like it will slip out when holding it,5
1974,for the price this is certainly a must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all,5
1975,i was looking for a smart looking case to keep my new iphone safe and free of scratches,5
1976,it is light weight not bulky like some of the cases tend to be,5
1977,i wanted to get a solid case for my phone so i haven't put it on yet so i can't speak from experience,5
1978,i do have to say that the screen protector is very smooth to the touch,5
1979,i get battery backups like these as gifts for my friends as they upgraded their phones,5
1980,this charger does exactly what i would have expected it to do which is to sit still plugged into a sound dock,5
1981,others have complained that the home button is hard to push but i've gotten used to the weight and added size,5
1982,only time will tell but i'm very pleased with the weight and build quality,5
1983,the system doubles the battery capacity so you can listen to your ipod without strangling yourself with the cables,5
1984,cable and plug does what it claims and i can't complain about the price of this package,5
1985,i charge my iphone as well as my wife's purple nexus 7 case,5
1986,i like how it's transparent and you can still see the flawless red color of my ipod,5
1987,i've had it for about a week but so far i love it,5
1988,i didn't receive the white pink yet but when i do i'll let you guys know what's up with it,5
1989,the cut-out doesn't bother me enough to knock it down to 4 stars but i'll give these speakers a 4,5
1990,all the ports are accessible so there is no need to run a cable to the cigarette lighter,5
1991,i was looking for a invisible shield protector for my iphone 5s and bought this one for my boyfriend's galaxy s4,5
1992,these work great but it is confusing that it comes with two different sized cords to plug the unit in,5
1993,bluetooth range when i used the speaker outside i was able to get about two and a half hours of solid music,5
1994,i was a little hesitant in purchasing this after reading some of the reviews for this item are being merged from different sellers,5
1995,this charger is exactly like the one i got with my phone and it works flawlessly,5
1996,my first bluetooth speaker this is not but it is the first time i felt satisfied with a bluetooth device,5
1997,the rubber has a slight bumper all around the edge of the phone that will give good face down protection,5
1998,it has rubber grips where the clamp meets the phone so it won't sink if it slips off your wrist,5
1999,i read how zagg invisibleshield felt rubbery and didn't want that so i finally settled on the techmatte qi receiver coil,5
2000,now the other great thing i love about this charger is that it fits in nice and tight,5
2001,that is really a cool feature because you do not have to take up separate outlets to do it,5
2002,it is a great feel in my hand looks classy and works perfectly,5
2003,strike that you have to click and hold the button to start charging the phone which is fast,5
2004,this little green box is about the size of a really thick smart phone,5
2005,to start charging your iphone you have to hold the power button for a few seconds and a sweet little led flashlight lights up,5
2006,the case also extends over the power and volume buttons so you can actually use them and they actually work very well,5
2007,the power switch is in the back of the phone without their getting stuck,5
2008,second time i purchase these protectors and all i can say is that she is a happy camper,5
2009,i've had this for that time and it looks the same as the pix and it protects my phone really well,5
2010,this thing fits perfectly all the holes are in the right places and the volume rocker button is fine for me,5
2011,its been dropped many times and the case protects very effectively,5
2012,excellent for camping hiking and anywhere else you don't have access to electricity or the car charger,5
2013,these are the best screen protector's i've used and i've been impressed with how it's performed so far,5
2014,you'll still need to order a screen protector if you're clumsy like me this is the case for you,5
2015,it protects my phone in case it drops the case is cute and doesn't really add that much bulk to it,5
2016,amazon was great also phone arrived fast and all i had to do was click the device and it synced,5
2017,i have not experienced any muffled or garbled conversations and i have not had it fall off like some other mounts,5
2018,have had this product on my phone for a month or so and there's no signs of wear and tear,5
2019,i love the quality of this case it doesn't get much better than this,5
2020,love this case because it fits perfectly the new htc one m8 and the new galaxy s5 are not qi ready,5
2021,although the shipping may take forever you really do get a great product here for under 20 dollars,5
2022,the price is great and so far i am very pleased with the functionality of both devices,5
2023,use compressed air and tape one of the sides to the side of the phone and it would adjust ringer volume,5
2024,it's a case for your iphone 5 this is great,5
2025,all in all i'm very satisfied with the price and quality of the product,5
2026,i was continually having to charge my phone took a chance and bought this after seeing how easy the repair was,5
2027,these are okay right now but i'll have to update my review and let you guys know what happens,5
2028,it works great as a convenience to keep around if you don't want a visible light this might not be for you,5
2029,i have purchased tech armor for iphones and now i have to put another one on my new phone,5
2030,i've had it for several months now and it continues to perform,5
2031,i had one of these with my galaxy s4 and it works great and charges fast,5
2032,i toss it in my gym bag and never have to worry about a dead tablet or phone again,5
2033,recently i've also been using this headset more as a hands-free headset when connected to your phone,5
2034,please note the connector is larger than the apple if you use a case you won't have a problem returning it,5
2035,this type of cord can be used with a charger or you can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone usb charger,5
2036,i purchased this charger because i travel quite a bit and carry it everywhere,5
2037,like the title says does what it's supposed to at a great price,5
2038,0amp claimed to be after reading all the negative reviews of this charger and frankly i'm flummoxed,5
2039,my first review this dual-tone screen protector is by far the best i've had well worth the price,5
2040,the only con i have is that the power button is a bit more difficult to slide than with the case off,5
2041,the case is a perfect fit and is very easy to put on and provides good protection for the phone,5
2042,i love the style and it fits perfectly on my iphone i have no complains about it,5
2043,that is really a cool feature because you do not have to take up separate outlets to do it,5
2044,i like touching the actual screen of thephone and the built in screen protector is the protection clincher for me,5
2045,i was so happy when i recieved this case in the mail yesterday and i am super excited about it,5
2046,it's attractive i got the orange color and has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone,5
2047,i'm a girly girl type of woman but i'm not at all worried that it won't do its job,5
2048,the shipping is free but it takes a while to get used to the additional size this type of case adds,5
2049,but it is also thoroughly protective and i feel confident it will and has protected my phone,5
2050,it has a raised edge along the front to protect the screen when it drops and the stylus is a nice size,5
2051,this has been such a nice addition that i not only use it for travel i use it as an emergency power boost,5
2052,no bubbles no fingerprints i definitely recommend this to anyone who is a tracfone user,5
2053,basically if i want to go out and don't want to carry loose cards and cash,5
2054,the built-in screen protector is much better than my old contracted provided,5
2055,it was great at church camp because i didn't really want to destroy the aesthetic of the phone,5
2056,i've used the urban armor gear case for a week now and it's been on my phone since i got this screen protector,5
2057,you spray the included solution onto the sticky side of the protector which i have no idea how they got there,5
2058,so far it works very good it is nice to be able to charge it when i am away from home,5
2059,she has had this case for 3 months now and it hasn't let me down,5
2060,the cable does feel different than the cable that came with it and with one i already had,5
2061,a couple of things i love about this lightening charger especially the fact that it comes with several size ear pieces,5
2062,the headphone ear pieces use what seems to be a high quality product for a very reasonable price,5
2063,definitely don't want to have this case if you drop your phone a lot you owe it to yourself to give these a try,5
2064,its not as rubberized as i thought it would be but it feels like a real solid phone,5
2065,the free screen protector fits perfectly and i was able to install without a single air pockets,5
2066,i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good cheap screen protector,5
2067,once in there it fits like a glove and is just as good as the highly expensive cases and in better colors,5
2068,i'm very very satisfied with this product and i am very pleased with its performance,5
2069,the battery comes with a usb micro cable which can be used to charge the battery and to charge microusb devices,5
2070,i got this for my husband and it's really nice because it looks like it's a part of the phone itself,5
2071,there are 2 belt loops that i don't use and the touchscreen keyboard is very good,5
2072,i like this case very nice looking and fit the phone very well i would buy this product agian very happy,5
2073,it is exactly the same as the charger that came with my phone except the cables aren't as long,5
2074,overall however it is a nice case and does what it needs to do and it is worth under ten dollars,5
2075,the iphone app is very well designed and easy to use bluetooth headsets i've ever used period,5
2076,i carry it with me all of the time but it is perfect for my grand daughter,5
2077,0all of the cutouts on the front of the phone that should keep the glass off of surfaces,5
2078,after using mine and liking it so much i just ordered a pink one for my wife here on amazon,5
2079,the charge time on the device is a couple of hours but it's a good size for me,5
2080,the cut outs match right up to the phone and it does not come out at all and sits well,5
2081,all of the inputs have a rubber seal and it does a great job allows you to adjust the image too,5
2082,this device was just what i was looking for for a good price,5
2083,first off i love the color of this case and that it has the little kickstand on it,5
2084,i well tell you that when i got the phone i would have the case for it already,5
2085,my son dropped his phone a bunch of times and it has worked flawlessly every time,5
2086,it a simple piece of silicone but it's easy to put on take off and does a great job preventing slips of the phone,5
2087,i thought putting the strap on everytime would bother me but it doesn't really affect how you use your iphone,5
2088,i've had the case for almost a year now and has not failed on me,5
2089,we've used this unit for a week now and i love the sleek size but still feels solid,5
2090,great case i really like it and recommend it to my friends and family members than i call,5
2091,the operation is very simple just hold down the power button to charge the case and presto,5
2092,i find that i do not have to worry about it falling apart or getting dirty,5
2093,i used them on my samsung gs3 and i also use them on my note 2 have have had no problems with them,5
2094,while on the bottom there's two usb ports for charging two devices at once but i am confident it will work great,5
2095,i've dropped my phone 2-3 times a day because of marks and oils,5
2096,the protectors are clear and you can't even tell the protector is there unless i look very close,5
2097,buy this case if you are on a budget this is the one you get,5
2098,with the remaining battery charge i was able to charge my iphone and ipad whenever i need to,5
2099,i can lay it down and don't have to worry about snagging a cable attached to your phone,5
2100,all things considered i love this product and it fits perfect on my phone,5
2101,quite literally you've got to compare them yourself side-by-side to truly appreciate it but that is my personal opinion,5
2102,having three in the package is nice just in case you mess up installation and you get a lifetime warranty,5
2103,this technology provides you the ability to charge your phone and a spare battery,5
2104,however this is by no means a protective case but i don't think the case gets in the way of that,5
2105,i absolutely love this case and i'm certain it will help protect my investment,5
2106,i would buy this product again if i need another cable,5
2107,love this case it has some rugged to it so it doesn't pick up fingerprints the diztronic did,5
2108,got sick of how bulky it was and am very happy with this product thus far and would highly recommend,5
2109,the stock battery just never has enough juice to get me through the day this device is a lifesaver for sure,5
2110,it looks as it will last as long as i own the phone,5
2111,they work great and i love that you can charge two devices at once one device usually being an ipad,5
2112,in non-direct sunlight this is the best screen protector ever i have used for any phone,5
2113,first off i want to say that this is a nice charger for the samsung galaxy note,5
2114,i personally like the soft plastic as it makes the phone easier to grip and not so slippery,5
2115,great charger i've been using this for a couple of days it still looks great,5
2116,if you are a teenager on the go and can't get to a wall or car charger,5
2117,if you need a very specific battery charger and don't want to take my whole wallet this works perfect fits phone pefect,5
2118,i actually bought one for a friend and she loves it hasnt taken it off,5
2119,the led lets me know if it's on or off battery status is really tiny,5
2120,yes the device is quite expensive but it works as it should and charges all of my samsung devices,5
2121,i loved the sound quality but disliked the fact that i had to bring the charger with me,5
2122,it will charge the phone and allow you to use it either as a magnetic mount or a clip-type mount,5
2123,this case is really cute and looks exactly like in the picture it's super cute and it fit perfectly,5
2124,battery capacity at 8400 mah astro2 is the largest-capacity external battery that i've ever tested,5
2125,this is a quality item and i'm sure glad i didn't waste the money,5
2126,this device lets me charge a battery and charge my phone at the same rate as plugging it in to your computer,5
2127,i have used several screen protectors and these seem to be the best dual product for the price that i order,5
2128,i don't use a stylus all the time for my iphone 4s but kept losing it,5
2129,this device is simple to use and i love being able to pop in and take out my phone with one hand,5
2130,i love the style and it fits perfectly on my iphone 4s all openings line up just right,5
2131,i won't kid you i have to buy a new one at a much higher price,5
2132,i'm very easy on my phones so i don't need a power strip laying next to my bed,5
2133,good protection for the htc droid good fit and has a good grip to it which makes it easy to hold,5
2134,for the low price of just 12 dollars i am very pleased with this purchase and glad to have another anker product,5
2135,this is actually a very great product i would recommend it if you're thinking about purchasing this for the galaxy s3,5
2136,go stand at the bottom so you can plug your phone in at the same time while you charge it,5
2137,the unit features two usb ports on the side i can charge more than one device at a time,5
2138,i didn't often use it so i gave it to my daughter as she tends to use the phone as a smartphone,5
2139,i also tested the battery pack on my wife's iphone 4 and it worked fine on a one-hour drive,5
2140,as an owner of other new trent products i knew what to expect when installing this skin on my tmobile g2,5
2141,looks great performs great and also does offer some protection to my phone without feeling like i'm carrying a brick,5
2142,it is so comfortable that you actually forget that you have it on the majority of the time,5
2143,people i am talking with tell me that the sound quality on their end sounds distant,5
2144,i d recommend this case to anyone that is looking to condense your charging needs,5
2145,i love this charger and i would recommend this to anyone who wants a clear and protected screen,5
2146,a really nice cable that actually works better at charging my iphone 5 or ipad and my girlfriends iphone 4,5
2147,when i go without a purse this is the perfect way to keep one with you all the time,5
2148,i purchased them for the iphone 5 and nexus 4 and i wouldn't trust my phone to anything else,5
2149,i have also used this to charge my cell phone and it does its job,5
2150,he is very happy with his new phone and i'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to a friend,5
2151,it may not be for everyone but for anyone who doesn't mind a little bit thicker phone,5
2152,works as well if not better than the stock samsung battery that came with the phone is also awesome,5
2153,i 8217ve been using it for a few days now and love how well it works,5
2154,i recently went to las vegas and i ordered another one of this type of case for him,5
2155,just take out the insert at the back of the dock and it is ready to go the next day,5
2156,i have not tried charging two things at the same time lights up when it's plugged into the charger,5
2157,i must say that this was by far the easiest and highest quality screen protector i have ever ordered,5
2158,all the buttons line up right and there is plenty of room to access the buttons and charging port,5
2159,overall this case does its job well without adding a ton of bulk to this already oversized phone,5
2160,the inside is also very well made as long as you don't need 4 g this is a great phone,5
2161,worked really well and allows me to charge my phone anywhere i go,5
2162,it holds my phone and keys while i go for a walk or do something that could cause damage to the phone,5
2163,the device is very easy to use and the battery life is excellent,5
2164,i'm pretty sure i am going to get another one for my razar when my old one broke,5
2165,great grip to it and seems like it's one of the best mounts but good luck getting it off,5
2166,the construction is solid and i like the size of the button cut outs,5
2167,i purchased this battery as a replacement and it works just as good on that phone too,5
2168,i have put a lot of apps on this phone and have not been disappointed in the slightest,5
2169,i am able to have both my iphone 5 and my kindle fire while i was on vacation and away from power sources,5
2170,but seriously i bought some for my iphone 5 and there have been a couple of standouts,5
2171,i needed a cheap fast usb to micro usb cable for charging the power bank itself the other for charging devices with micro usb ports,5
2172,the top 1 4 of the case folds back so it is very easy to remove and feels great in my hand,5
2173,it holds the phone securely and is easy to adjust to any angle and very secure on the dashboard,5
2174,it has a micro usb connection so i can use the same cord to charge my phone during the day,5
2175,if the edge meets the side of the case it makes it easier to hold on to,5
2176,i love the blue one it is so pretty and it doesn't feel like a piece of junk,5
2177,this was the first time i ordered these and it was easy to put on my phone and made the screen crisp and clear,5
2178,but this is about the 4-port charger and if you're on the fence about this case go ahead and get it,5
2179,i have recieved this case and i must say i am quite impressed,5
2180,this is a really great screen protector for the iphone 5 is a very good basic case,5
2181,bought through aliexpress and it arrived in less than a week after i ordered it,5
2182,i've had my anker for 5 months now and i'm really happy with this purchase for my phone and ipad,5
2183,i highly recommend this case it offers good protection for your iphone as it is water-proofish,5
2184,i have been using one for a couple of weeks and i've been very pleased with it,5
2185,i've only been using it for a day and it did not fall off,5
2186,she said it was very easy to set up and convenient to use,5
2187,that is probably the only thing i would change is the plastic over the home screen button,5
2188,i'm pretty picky when it comes to my iphone 5 case and i love it,5
2189,i drop my phone all the time and i don't think i'm going to need to anymore,5
2190,this product takes the guesswork out of putting on a screen protector and it works looks and feels great,5
2191,the case is light and doesn't bulk up the tablet in any way,5
2192,these headphones do not disappoint on any front as far as i can tell this is the real deal and not a knock-off,5
2193,it definitely helps with the antenna issue so i am more than satisfied with this device and would definitely recommend it to others,5
2194,other than that it is the perfect length for my needs as well,5
2195,it comes with a usb charging cable so if you don't have a powermat to charge this wirelessly,5
2196,it also won't hold your phone if you have a phone that is4 4,5
2197,if you are in the market for a smartphone so that i could have the convenience of the longer cord on my ipad4,5
2198,great features and by far the best headset i've ever tried and i'm very pleased with my purchase,5
2199,the case feels very good in your hand i would say the price is a little to high for a plastic stand like this,5
2200,the length is perfect almost if not the same as the original one for the galaxys 3 note,5
2201,hopefully this nice little charger won't get lost in the sea of comments already here but anker deserves the positive feedback,5
2202,i would recommend it to anyone who wants a very affordable durable bluetooth speaker,5
2203,if you're somewhat klutzy and or you tend to drop your phone this is not for you,5
2204,i ended up buying two and i highly recommend this product to any one who bought there child an i-phone,5
2205,i love this phone case out of all the cases i bought this one seems to rattle a little,5
2206,bought this for the inlaws as a gift and of course i had to put 2 aaa batteries in it and voila it worked,5
2207,you will be very pleased and i don't see a suitable alternative from anyone else,5
2208,i've had this external battery pack for several weeks now and i'm very happy with it,5
2209,my only real complaint is that the strip that covers the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4 g tower,5
2210,the power bank itself is rechargeable and it's easy to see when driving to make sure your charging your phone,5
2211,it also seems to snap on with just the right amount of protection without all the bulk of the defender,5
2212,this case took a few weeks to get but worth the wait and the case is still in perfect condition,5
2213,i like that you can power 2 devices at the same time-built in led flashlight,5
2214,this is about the best brand of screen protectors i've bought from illumishield for 2 different phones,5
2215,i have this one in my office so i can charge my phone about 4 times before fully depleting the battery,5
2216,i just keep it at my desk or in my bag in case i drain the charged one in my phone,5
2217,i saw this and ordered it and it is exactly what i thought it would be very cute,5
2218,i'm happy to say this case did it's job and protected my phone from almost 3 story drop,5
2219,the charger works just fine and it's not that difficult to get it right the first time,5
2220,that works just as well for me as i have a charger in my husband's car as well,5
2221,i plugged in my android phone and my wife's ipad simultaneously when we travel together by car,5
2222,use compressed air and tape one of the sides to the side of the phone makes it easier to hold the phone,5
2223,i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good screen protector for your products,5
2224,if a call comes in during music play the music pauses and you can talk through the speaker as it has a built in microphone,5
2225,this isn't an otterbox but it was pretty inexpensive so i ran the risk of not liking it,5
2226,besides outdoor uses the battery is perfect for when you want to watch movies on your phone,5
2227,doesn't add too much weight and it actually makes the phone easier to use as your finger slides easier across the screen,5
2228,only minor complain is that it makes the phone easy to hold and less slippery,5
2229,it works as well as the otterbox then this case is a no brainer for those looking for an upgrade,5
2230,after a few weeks of regular usage the case is still in pristine condition after about 9 months of constant use,5
2231,this is one of the best cases i've had for any phone and i've bought a lot,5
2232,this case is not only beautiful but is one of my favorites because of the matte texture and translucent color,5
2233,over the past two months they have worked just as good if not better due to the anti-fingerprint coating,5
2234,i drop my phone all the time and if it weren't for android there still would be nothing in its class,5
2235,but to my surprise it fit my phone perfect and was easy to use,5
2236,if you want a basic protection for your phone i recommend this case for anyone who has kids works with kids they love it,5
2237,i have owned the previous versions of this bluetooth in the past and have had the chance to compare them against other products,5
2238,one feature i really like about this battery pack is that it is an awesome little flash light,5
2239,i love having a dedicated iphone charger for my car so i can charge my ipad and iphone before needing to recharge the powerpak,5
2240,this is a terrific device if like me you have multiple devices that you use this is perfect,5
2241,i do not know how long it will last but it was free,5
2242,i'm going to give this 5 stars because it is more durable than the dagi and much less expensive,5
2243,i wanted a case to help protect against scratches and such but i didn't have to take it apart to get it dried out,5
2244,i updated it to android ice cream sandwich and i don't even need to take the phone out of the case,5
2245,just chiming in with the other reviews this is a great case and it fits the iphone 4 g perfectly,5
2246,so far i'm very happy with this case over the past few weeks i've been researching wireless qi charging,5
2247,the quality is very good and it's one of the best mounts but good luck getting it off,5
2248,i bought it from here on amazon prime wasn't available at the time and is now just available in india,5
2249,its fits the phone good does add bulk to the phone and it really does stick to the dash,5
2250,bluetooth gets better all the time and i don't think i'll be needing any lol,5
2251,its a nice thin case that is easy to take off but more of a challenge to put back on,5
2252,the colors are great and she's dropped her phone a few times with no problems and barely a scratch on the case,5
2253,if you have any specific questions please feel free to ask i'm constantly checking this thread,5
2254,i haven't even used this because i can't bring myself to take it off my iphone,5
2255,because it was so so inexpensive i'm not sure how long the talk time is on this device,5
2256,the best part is that the case does not interfere with the functionality of the phone,5
2257,after opening the box i was very happy with the fact that it is a 5 pack for the price of a 3 pack,5
2258,this mount fits perfect and is very secure i use it with my phone and so far it's been great,5
2259,as for compatible devices i used the bolse to charge my kindle fire hd ipad samsung galaxy 3 fitbit flex and kindle paperwhite,5
2260,plus note in my opinion these are one of the best cases on the market but they also make the best screen protectors,5
2261,the only thing to watch out is that the headphone jack is too narrow and deep to fit wider headphone plugs,5
2262,it fits snuggly in the socket and does the job of charging two devices in the space of one plug,5
2263,overall i am pleasantly surprised by the speed of the charging,5
2264,i have no complaints about this product and think it's a great deal for anyone out there,5
2265,i used the larger of the two to go around the phone and clip everything in place well,5
2266,i've had this case on my gold iphone 5s for a little over a month and my iphone is still sitting pretty in it,5
2267,if they give out in a few months i will be purchasing these again,5
2268,i was looking for a invisible shield protector for my iphone 5s and i must say they look great and work as advertised,5
2269,if that's the case then it's not the case it's me as i would like to say,5
2270,to turn on the device you need to press and hold the button for a few seconds to get it to power on or off,5
2271,i also like the glowing orange when the device is in use i actually think it looks great,5
2272,i've had for about a year and a half now i recommend them to everyone i know,5
2273,this looks really good and i am glad that i found this dash mount,5
2274,very subtle and low profile and doesn't take away from the feel of the iphone itself,5
2275,i had a belkin cover on my iphone 4s and it does a great job keeping it charged when it is not plugged in,5
2276,it's also got a lcd readout so you can see how much capacity it has left in it,5
2277,i feel like my phone is very well protected and i would buy this again if i ever have the need to use one,5
2278,hands down one of the best cases i have bought for my iphone since i got it,5
2279,it is a very noticably difference in the time it takes to fully charge an empty case battery,5
2280,5 mm audio cable you can plug into any device that has a 3,5
2281,used it for a day now and it doesn't collect fingerprints like the glossy kind of cases do,5
2282,i haven't dropped it yet so don't know how it works but it looks cool on her phone,5
2283,the color is similar to the photo is easy to place on the windshield and holds in place very well,5
2284,it charges quickly and the batteries seem to work just as well as the ones sold for a lot more at stores,5
2285,this is pretty neat caused it protects the phone one thing i dont like about this phone is the simplicity of the user interface,5
2286,i think my favorite thing about this case has to be the best one so far,5
2287,i bought this for my brother who has a habit of dropping her phone,5
2288,i like that it is matte and not shiny at all,5
2289,both ports were able to charge my iphone and ipad and it has functioned exceptionally well in that capacity,5
2290,one of the things i was looking for in a case for my new iphone 5s,5
2291,my wife and i can both charge our phones at the same time what's not to like about them,5
2292,i have had tracfone service for about 6 months now and i have zero complaints about its use,5
2293,i definately didn't want that so i went with this one and i am not dissapointed,5
2294,it provides a lot of functionality with almost no additional bulk or weight and best of all it looks cool,5
2295,high quality screen protector can't even tell that it is on the screen,5
2296,i got these batteries for my htc evo v 4 g perfect does not ad to much bulk,5
2297,i mounted the button about an inch and a half and didn't feel like it would work without ripping the nail,5

2299,i have one in my travel case one in my bedroom one in my day bag and one at work,5

2302,my favorite color is green when i put this on my phone i can not get them off,5
2303,i've had this case for about three weeks and i think it is an excellent little unit,5
2304,the new trent trentium is exactly what i was looking for to help spice up my white phone,5
2305,it was easy to install and there were no spraying involved,5
2306,i would call and say it didn't come with a sim card so i don't know if it will fit the 4,5
2307,i feels right and does not take away from the screen so there is no annoying air pocket,5
2308,it adds very little bulk to the phone but still get the job done,5
2309,the front provides good protection to the screen as well as a plastic squeegee to remove air bubbles when applying,5
2310,it is heavy but a must have item if you have a cell phone that holds mp3 music,5
2311,i am using it to charge my cell phones i can also use it to charge any device that accepts a micro usb connector,5
2312,the stand is adjustable 8211 you need to press the button on the side of the headset that is a multifunction control,5
2313,also the phone can be laid down on it's face without the screen touching the surface,5
2314,since i needed an extra long usb cable for my iphone really is nice,5
2315,it was great at first but then after using for a couple of weeks now but so far i love it,5
2316,i was able to easily maintain a signal from my samsung galaxy note 3 from almost no battery to a full charge in an hour,5
2317,a bright blue light makes it easy to tell how much charge you have left in it,5
2318,in the past i've dropped my phone and it's a protector,5
2319,luckily it can also be charged with a micro usb cable since those are a lot more common,5
2320,great find and happily discovering new things i like about the phone the phone is a very basic look which i find better,5
2321,haven't had an accident with this one but it's something to consider when choosing a portable charger,5
2322,i use a stylus all the time but there are times when i found myself missing the stylus from my old palm,5
2323,when on the go it's so much easier to understand the other party,5
2324,i assumed that and got exactly what i was expecting it to be a bit smaller,5
2325,my regular samsung charger that i got with my phone and it works fine,5
2326,it works fine it protects the screen yet does not interfere with the touch sensitivity at all,5
2327,the snap on the flap is very secure and will not let your phone drop easily,5
2328,i already had the h700 and really liked it so i was skeptical to switch brands,5
2329,the sound is loud and clear on both ends of the call and is very simple to use,5

2351,when the unit is pairing the blue and red lights flash alternately to put it into pairing mode,5
2352,everything was good and delivered just missing directions on how to get the most out of my battery,5
2353,it is worth the price if you are looking for a very short connector,5
2354,the fogging clears up fairly quickly and is not a problem but i wanted to know the time frame,5
2355,i thought i would always want a case with a kick stand so i went for it,5
2356,i was hoping to be able to use the phone while it's charging unless you use the long cord,5
2357,it does not improve the sound quality of the music is excellent that can blow your mind,5
2358,the design is solid that seems like it will hold up to day-to-day abuse it usually takes,5

2364,as with the rest of the ravpower line this is a well-built case that fits the s3 perfectly,5
2365,i had read all the bad reviews and thus far i've had no real problems with it,5
2366,i can tilt my phone to all angles and no one can see whats going on on my phone,5

2378,bows are so nice and people ask me where i got my case bc they had the same phone,5
2379,not sure if that turns out to be a good thing,5
2380,this is the second time i purchased this case for 3,5
2381,and i love the color is not as bright as the red in the picture it looks like a dark pink more than red,5
2382,i have had these for a while now and they keep upping their game,5
2383,i've had this for at least a month now and no problems what so ever,5
2384,i thought it was going to be a normal screen protector but i prefer to go without so not an issue for me,5
2385,great to own a second one of these for my daughter and she is please with it,5
2386,there are 4 small blue leds on the front face of the aon5 blink sequentially to indicate charging is taking place,5

2398,i love the neo hybrid case it's the best of all worlds and i highly recommend it,5
2399,i ordered this case as a filler because i was trying to get up the protector to get a small piece of dirt under it,5
2400,so i had accepted the fact i would have to go with bluetooth for streaming music from my phone,5
2401,the tips for application make sure you take your time and do it right,5
2402,it is so clear that you can't even tell that it's on the phone once you put it on,5
2403,sound quality has been generally excellent as long as you don't intentionally slam it into the pavement,5

2410,i got the wall charger so i can always charge my ipod when i need to,5
2411,the cloth tip is something that few styluses have and it makes a huge difference to the range i can get in the house,5
2412,once i found out that this would work with my samsung galaxy tab 2 7,5
2413,when i recieved my package i didn't think it would but i thought i'd try it since it's water resistant,5
2414,this case has a great feels and it is easy to find a replacement it is just a standard cable,5
2415,i am a slim case lover but this one is one of the good ones and is made solid and strong,5
2416,in summary theampen ultra-sensitive capacitive stylusis an excellent choice for users of android phones with their interactive touchscreens,5
2417,so far i find the phone to be easy to use like any other droid device,5
2418,how many times have you been out and you need to use your phone all day get something like this,5
2419,we'll find out over time and i'll come back and update further in a few days weeks with anything relevant,5
2420,i now have a few of these zebra cases and i love that i can listen to music while i work out,5
2421,was skeptical at first when i bought it now that i have it i can't live without it anymore,5
2422,i am partially deaf and i have a hard time finding my phone coz its too black lol,5
2423,i ordered this and it's a very good quality and is pretty loud,5
2424,the only issue is that it's hard to get out of a pocket,5
2425,if you want a well-made well-fitted case that i think is well worth the money if you want a stylus,5
2426,hold both my iphone and my wife's samsung galaxy siii and she is absolutely thrilled with it,5
2427,this adaptor works very well so that i can use the cable to charge my phone through my otter box,5
2428,i've actually dropped my phone twice recently and i am happy to say that the battery is a bargain,5
2429,i have only used the phone for a few days but so far it is amazing,5
2430,anyway it works well and i recommend this if you need a spare battery for your inspire,5
2431,it also fits very well and it is definitely better than a scratch you can't repair,5
2432,the larges view window is great and easy to use even with the silicone on top of some of the buttons,5
2433,while not the fastest and most powerful android device it does exactly what it is designed to do and does it beautifully,5
2434,this cable is a good length and works great with my htc one nexus 10 and gopro hd hero2,5
2435,cons none that i can think of disclosure i was supplied a sample for the purpose of review and evaluation and promised an unbiased review,5
2436,after breaking my phone this is just what i needed and i would definitely recommend this over any other extended battery,5
2437,well worth 20 now i don't have to spend a arm and and a leg,5
2438,i ordered this battery because i thought my original battery might be going bad,5
2439,and i'm very much happy it does want i need it to do and you certainly can't beat the price,5
2440,4 amps labeled and other usb port has a max output of 1 amp and the other is labeled 8220 2,5
2441,even when music is playing and you get a call it automatically pauses the music and starts playing a little tune,5
2442,this new battery makes the s3 very similar in size and weight and it has the standard 1 8 3,5
2443,the blue light is easy on the eyes and my finger glides across the screen with zero resistance,5
2444,you will notice that it has two usb ports and feels very sturdy,5
2445,i used this to charge my iphone 5s and my ipad air and it works perfectly on both,5
2446,i also order the metal closure that can be used with this charger are currently listed on their site,5
2447,the tudia case is hands down the best value for the money anywhere,5
2448,it stays put keeps a good grip on the phone and i've dropped it a lot and it kept my phone safe,5
2449,it's great to have a few bucks so you don't have to worry about extra cable from regular headphones,5
2450,it's cheaper but it's more durable and protects the phone just as good as any 50 case so why spend the big bucks,5
2451,cover sections over volume rocker and on off button are uncovered which is the only thing i would put on my phones,5
2452,i keep it in my camera gear bag and have used it to charge the things i listed in the title,5
2453,a really nice case that still keeps the phone slim and less like a 34 brick 34,5
2454,thankfully i remembered bringing my anker slimtalk 3200mah portable power bank backup external battery charger rapid-recharge 3a output dual-port,5
2455,i can change the color when i get tired of one color i can switch it up,5
2456,on the second time i charged the external battery i was able to charge my phone about 4 times before fully depleting the battery,5
2457,my wife has an iphone 5 and it works as designed,5
2458,it is very small and thin which adds no weight to the phone and has a good feel in hand,5
2459,when i use it to charge my phone and my kindle both at once,5
2460,the black rubber part works good to keep the phone from being pressed forward and snapping the connector,5
2461,i am satisfied with this product and i am very pleased with this charger,5
2462,comes with a variety of connector tips or you can use your own usb charging cable with this power bank,5
2463,i have dropped my phone a couple times with the case on and only a few scratches got on it,5
2464,the plastic material is great and it doesn't get stuck in my pocket while still not being slippery in hand,5
2465,i wouldn't recommend a full day of use right out of the box it performed an ota update to 4,5
2466,i previously had nowhere to safely place my phone when i was in the car and once i received this i was very pleased,5
2467,not much reason not to get one if you don't mind the wires and are looking for a dual purpose device,5
2468,its a super good fit and all the holes line up perfectly with the features on the phone,5
2469,i knew that the battery would be a good fit for the camera etc,5
2470,so i looked for this one it's like the one i had for my original phone but had trouble finding something i liked,5
2471,dont feel like there is a screen protector on my phone,5
2472,its great at blocking out background noise and the sound quality is good along with the play time,5
2473,i recommend these cases to anyone who like to have their phone on a stand and a traditional handset,5
2474,exactly what i was looking for to use with my iphone 4s with an otter box case,5
2475,this product is exactly as described it does what it is supposed to do and writing on the ipad works very well,5
2476,it's nice looking with the white case which has a grey silicone slip on it,5
2477,bought this for my 16 year old daughter and when it arrived it was better than ever,5
2478,protection as i said in 1 there is a soft inner shell and a rugged outer shell that protects the phone if dropped,5
2479,it is only one piece easy to get on and off the phone if you need to,5
2480,with my old band i would have to take the case off for it to work,5
2481,been using these for a week in an htc evo 4 g and i liked it because it's namebrand,5
2482,she loves the way it doesnt slip out of your hand when plugging devices into it,5
2483,i did notice that the case is a little stretched if you are using the oem wireless charging cover,5
2484,the screen protector is a perfect fit for my samsung galaxy,5
2485,it has 2 ports for any usb cord so i don't need to buy the cheaply-made plantronics case,5
2486,so this battery is really good for when you forget to charge or when going on long drives,5
2487,also if you have an android phone then you shouldn't have to change it more than once if at all,5
2488,it charges my iphone and my tablet at the same time with two seperate frequencies specialized for most mobile devices,5
2489,new openmic technology is very useful so you don't have to worry about accidentally breaking the phone,5
2490,very nice screen protectors of portable and easy to put on i would recommend them for anyone who likes diamonds,5
2491,i am forever trying to find my phone but now i don't have to worry that it won't reach the counter,5
2492,i bought two i love that it has a cover for the screen,5
2493,this means that you will not have to worry about whether or not you will have enough battery,5
2494,one unique feature of this external power pack is that it has a micro usb for charging and not need batteries,5
2495,i have been using it for a few months now and it is still staying strong,5
2496,i've only used this for a couple of weeks and i'm still on my first one having 5 left,5
2497,now i feel totally comfortable when taking my iphone out of my pocket because all the controls are on the front,5
2498,i had the 1st jabra halo and it had a lot of positive reviews oh and very good price,5
2499,the fit of this is perfect and you can easily press the silence volume and sleep buttons,5
2500,21 removes all bloatware and now they make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger,5
2501,these screen protectors are really easy to install and didnt had any bubbles coming up,5
2502,i like the clean crisp color and it fits really well on my phone and it feels about the same to me,5
2503,it's basically a small bluetooth receiver that you can plug into any standard usb port on a computer but at a slower rate,5
2504,it is very sturdy and protects the phone very well for the cost of the case it is a great deal,5
2505,i just wanted to have an additional charger for my samsung galaxy ii phone which needs a lot of charging,5
2506,the built in stand for the samsung gs3 version is easy to use and is a quality battery with expected life span according to use,5
2507,thicker than other screen protectors but that's to be expected from a defender series case,5
2508,i loved the price and they were easy to put on and saved my screen from being scratched,5
2509,i have been looking for a dual plug car charger for a while now and can honestly state that it has served me well,5
2510,have owned it for 4 months and it is very easy to take the phone in out of the cradle,5
2511,i'm going to buy a second one to keep as a spare in case i drop my phone again,5
2512,i had no problem putting it on the phone and have not had a problem with it since i have owned it approx 2 years,5
2513,i love the way it feels and the way it fits the sg s3,5
2514,it's a little heavy to carry in a pocket but it is perfect if you are staying with the factory battery,5
2515,this however will ware off soon i hope and i don't think it will do much if it falls face first,5
2516,it fits very comfortable in my ear and i love the fact that it brings everything you need to apply it successfully,5
2517,the battery pack works great but you need to make sure your phone is qi-compliant wireless charging capable,5
2518,it fits my nokia lumia 928 well and does a good job protecting my galaxys iii from bumps and sliding around,5
2519,i use this on extended trips when i'll be away from a place to charge up for a while,5
2520,i have had the anker battery for a month now and it is still scratch free it is perfectly clear too,5
2521,i didn't need the ground loop isolator and the audio is loud and clear and the charge lasts up to 5 hours,5
2522,the mesh covering has held up to 6-8 hours a day and this works better than expected,5
2523,i'm pretty confident i can get through the day without having to plug in then this is the way to go,5
2524,item came in a timely manner i bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it,5
2525,nicely made silicone-type material it doesn't add too much to the size of the phone or the armband itself,5
2526,i have used it for my iphone 4s and ipad 2 at the same time,5
2527,number one iphone screen protectors i like to keep my phone handy when out for a walk,5
2528,this case is a rubbery plastic tpu and looks like it will do a much better job protecting it if dropped,5
2529,before proceeding i want to let you know that i am very happy with the rest of the capabilities of this phone,5
2530,after shelling out so much on the phone i didn't have much to lose by giving them a shot,5
2531,having purchased the tech armor clear screen protector for my galaxy iii works well no bubbles om install,5
2532,i like this little case for when i go out and don't want to take my purse,5
2533,i would recommend getting this to be able to use with my iphone 5,5
2534,it took me no more than three minutes and i'm writing this review i get lots of compliments on it,5
2535,no the apple iphone 4s has glass on the front and the back on top of the screen protectors,5
2536,i have been using otterbox for over three years now and i don't have a ac plug with me,5
2537,it even has a built in led light quickly press the power button twice to turn on off the led flashlight,5
2538,i have purchased several cases for my phone and this has been the best,5
2539,not just that but the seller got it to me much faster than advertised,5
2540,i received this charger for reviewing purposes we have put it to the test and tried all manner of sharp objects to scratch it,5
2541,these work great but it is confusing that it comes with two different sized cords to plug the unit in,5
2542,i plan on getting a lot of use out of it on my travels,5
2543,i really like having this screen protector on my phone since i revived it,5
2544,hold the power button down until the led flashes red blue and pair i with your device,5
2545,the equalizer has a number of pre-sets and gives you the ability to still use it while protecting it,5
2546,not a bad deals since you get 3 in the pack and i'm still using the first screen protector,5
2547,i got this as a gift but think i need to buy another for the same phone or smart phone,5
2548,these are not as flimsy as the ones they sell in the mall for many times more,5
2549,cons what i didn't like was that this does not come with the actual button that you press i,5
2550,its the best unit i have used to date and i really like it,5
2551,in between the phone and the back of the case and the battery turns on,5
2552,simple to use many additional features if you want to use them everyday to replace the stock they will work great,5
2553,its always good to have a spare fully charged battery now as a backup,5
2554,i am very pleased with this case and it is still intact,5
2555,so it would probably charge up to 100 % in less than a minute and the sounds quality was indistinguishable from direct wire,5
2556,but if you just drop it from time to time and found it easy to use,5
2557,much less expensive than anything from the at t store and it was applied by the rep there,5
2558,i had 3 other otterbox cases in the past and they always work well,5
2559,it is so awesome that i ordered two one for home and the other to keep in my travel bag,5
2560,i like to use a stylus at times with my ipad and i noticed it didn't really work,5
2561,i have had my charger for a few weeks and i have found it to be perfect for garage sale shopping and county fairs,5
2562,using the car charger is super easy because all you have to do is to call h2o customer services to port my number,5
2563,i just received this item today and i must say that they are exactly what i wanted and they are flexible and durable,5
2564,i already dropped it 2-3 times and nothing happened to my phone really a great case fast shipping,5
2565,this comes with a 10 inch micro usb cable to charge the power bank and compatible mobile devices,5
2566,i highly recommend this product if you are looking for extra battery life for your iphone and that is a big deal,5
2567,now my dad does not have to worry about breaking my original one so that's great,5
2568,i love that this screen protector doesn't go all the way around the home button at the bottom,5
2569,i plugged it into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in less than an hour in an operational vehicle,5
2570,i had the original palm pre and found that this is one of the more versatile models out for this holiday season,5
2571,i've had a blackberry playbook for a couple of years now and they consistently deliver high quality solid products,5
2572,i began charging an ipod at 75 % and it was fully charged within an hour and a half,5
2573,this minisuit case is the 3rd case i purchased from amazon over the past few years they all still work,5
2574,i paid 30 for my first glass screen protector and i will not go back to i-phone,5
2575,highly recommend the product to anyone who is looking for a cheaper cellular service,5
2576,i really like that it includes a screen protector for the back of the iphone 5 but right now i do not have anything,5
2577,most important of all it doesn't make your phone that much bigger either,5
2578,its stylish the texure on the back of the phone and the case behind becomes the battery cover,5
2579,i do occasionally play games on my iphone 4 and the color is bright a vibrant,5
2580,it is very comfortable in my ear that i can barely feel it there while in my ear,5
2581,just recieved my case 2 days before it was supposed to and the color is perfect,5
2582,i got this and already have it on my iphone 4 and it still works great,5
2583,i purchased the frosted tpu case for my samsung galaxy s4 and it charges much quicker,5
2584,be sure to use the correct port you need for the device you are needing to charge,5
2585,this bluetooth speaker is great and i love it because it's actually pretty thick so it protects my phone screen,5
2586,the cell phone opener kit was just what i needed for a cross country trip lately,5
2587,blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing i've bought for my phone,5
2588,why buy the more expensive brand when you can get the same performance from a slightly used battery,5
2589,i ordered it for my cell phone and my tablet at the same time,5
2590,i switched to this charger and it is able to charge my phone several times over on just one charge,5
2591,i am new to bluetooth and i purchased this item as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it,5
2592,it works as advertised the item arrived promptly and was just as it was described,5
2593,very subtle and low profile and doesn't take away from the slim look and feel of the device,5
2594,the answer end button is backlit so it's easy to find for any first time user,5
2595,dropped the white phone on ceramic tile and when i picked it up my phone was unscathed no scratches or cracks whatsoever,5
2596,i was really impressed that it doesn't add much bulk maybe just enough to make it feel more solid imo,5
2597,i've been using it for about a week now and so far the screen is holding up well,5
2598,this thing is a beast of a screen protector and i would buy from these guys again a,5
2599,the range is not that great but i can't fault the product for that because it clearly states 4 feet,5
2600,this case is great it is super durable and has a great feel to it and didn't seem to be made of cheap material,5
2601,slim protects the corners and my phone when i drop it and i just love it,5
2602,i like being able to see the apple sign on the back of the case tends to fade after a while,5
2603,so with this charger i can put one micro-usb cable for my android phone and sony camcorder were no exceptions,5
2604,i use this every single day and i do not think i would like the note as much without it,5
2605,i ordered this stylus because i do a lot of traveling and have an ipod touch iphone,5
2606,received on time and exactly as described and works perfectly with my digital camera,5
2607,it fits my phone perfectly allowing easy access to the side buttons and a hole for the camera,5
2608,i hate putting these things on but if you follow the directions exactly and take your time it works great,5
2609,i have found that i only have to charge my battery every day,5
2610,a red light comes on to let you know it is plugged in and working,5
2611,i charged it when i bought it and have been using it for about a month now and no problems so far,5
2612,they fit the phone perfectly and they were easy to put on and i can listen to music and never miss a call,5
2613,the screen protector is not the greatest but i did not buy this for myself i did purchase them as christmas gifts,5
2614,although the shipping may take forever you really do get a great product here for under 20 dollars,5
2615,what i really like is that it did not come with a wall plug but that is now standard for these,5
2616,this thing has really made dealing with the phone in the car a whole lot quicker than this,5
2617,in situations where you want to listen to music or talk on the phone,5
2618,with on-ear headphones in the past this has been the case for the rest of the iphones including the iphone 5,5
2619,have had it for a few months now and am very please with it,5
2620,i've used several car chargers and this one ranks up there with the very best and my favorite,5
2621,the rhinestones case are very secure and i get tons of compliments on the cell phone case,5
2622,i have purchased tech armor products in the past and have always found them to be reliable beutifully designed and durable,5
2623,i love this case its really cute and it looks just like the one that came with the ipad,5
2624,its a rubberized plastic and it was easy to put on and easy to take off,5
2625,i thought it worked fairly well but after a few months it still works as expected great buy,5
2626,you can go wrong with it as long as you have a quality single screen protecter you're good to go,5
2627,this is the best one yet the only thing that i wasn't in love with is the case,5
2628,it's made of a solid plastic and the little arms that hold it are not intrusive to the viewing area,5
2629,that's not saying its bad but it's not as good as the iphone but in reality it is wonderful,5
2630,this product does not add too much bulk like the other otter box cases,5
2631,these ones are slightly smaller than the edge of the glass but this one just fits within the screen borders,5
2632,better than in the pictures and the build quality is very nice given the fairly low price,5
2633,all the port openings are where they should be and they don't interfere with the touch capability at all,5
2634,it has a micro usb charging port on the bottom of the phone and the side of the phone aimed at the meter,5
2635,this is a complete solution with a wall charger and a charger for your car as well,5
2636,i got screen protectors for my ipad 2 and iphone 4s at the same time and this was it,5
2637,5 amp for faster charging 8211 that can be used at the same time but you can not charge 2 2,5
2638,it is easy to put on as the phone fits into the case snug but without having to force it fit,5
2639,recommended use i would highly recommend this case to anyone with the htc one,5
2640,it was easy to install fits the phone with the extended battery just like a glove all the cutouts line up perfect,5
2641,also it comes with screen protectors for the front and back so it fully encloses my iphone 5s,5
2642,delivery was a bit long like 2 weeks but it was worth it trust me i am an electrician,5
2643,bought this to use with the galaxy s2 and i am glad that i purchased this to go with my htc windows phone,5
2644,this kind of case protects the phone from scratches and dings and makes holding this samsung phone easier,5
2645,a few wall chagers i've had in the past have not been able to get it to take a full charge,5
2646,metal slate is basically black and only slightly lighter than the rest of the case but it probably makes pulling out of pocket easier though,5
2647,another downside to it is that you'll need your own usb cable if you have an iphone 5 get this,5
2648,after using this for a couple of months and it's still in perfect condition,5
2649,the part of the stylus that touches the screen is roughly the size of a ladies lipstick or maybe just slightly larger,5
2650,overall i am happy with this case and recommend it to anyone that wants a car charger,5
2651,this one i got from plantronics is by far the best option out there for price quality protection and peace of mind,5
2652,it holds well and isn't bulky which is nice as it doesn't hamper use of the touch screen,5
2653,the screen protector didn't leave any bubbles i'm very happy with this purchase and i would certainly recommend it,5
2654,update 7 18 i've raised my rating to 5 stars because now the consumer knows what they are getting,5
2655,i have purchased other items from 34 the friendly swede 34 and i found these longer stylus,5
2656,it did take a full 24 hrs to charge the battery and the devices you want to charge wit the battery,5
2657,but it works exactly like the original and is well worth the price i will purchase same or similar product in the future,5
2658,this charger is very reliable and it can charge both my iphone and my wife's samsung galaxy s5 and i love them both,5
2659,in the car i've got another setting so i don't even have to take my power brick or sync cable with me,5
2660,to make sure you understand this this means you can charge the battery pack and the phone at the same time this case does that,5
2661,the cable served it's purpose well and it's too bad that meego hasn't taken off,5
2662,this isn 8217 t a usb hub and there is no way to set it to default save to gmail,5
2663,if i continue to upgrade my phone if i need a emergency charge up to 50 %,5
2664,its a great product it fits the phone and protects the screen when it is closed,5
2665,i love the quality of this case it has a rubber coating on the inside so it won't scratch the display,5
2666,i had my white case for about a week or so now and am very happy with it and would buy it again,5
2667,i know it sounds crazy but it's nice to have a cable on hand all the time on a keychain,5
2668,great price and good quality i have only used one so far bit they are very well made,5
2669,i'll need to get an adapter but again this is a problem with all brands of android devices with 4,5
2670,one piece so theirs no corners coming apart like some of the others that i have purchased but work great,5
2671,i like how the phone feels more rugged which allows me to use the phone in the car without using battery,5
2672,this cable is very good quality and i highly recommend it to anyone especially for the price,5
2673,i have had this on my ipod for over a year now and am constantly impressed by it,5
2674,this is an amazing deal for a micro-usb cord and the need for a lightning cable is eliminated,5
2675,i've had many cases in the past for other phones and have never been extremely impressed,5
2676,i purchased this phone in december and i have been very happy with this product it stays on the windshield and is very sturdy,5
2677,this protector is curved to fit the entire front of the phone but it's just too pretty for that to matter,5
2678,it comes with 5 so if you mess up you can redo it unlike standard screen covers,5
2679,i've had no issues with it so far and it's stayed attached to his pants so far,5
2680,then this past week i used it for 5 days now i like it,5
2681,i like it for the holidays as it has a little 34 bling 34 to their phone while protecting it without spending too much,5
2682,i have been using galaxy note ii for several months and just had to have this one,5
2683,disclaimer i received this product in exchange for a completely honest review on amazon,5
2684,but it's cheap so i'll buy a new one i have big reasons to love the seidio,5
2685,i ordered for world wide distributors and i can tell you that it is a whole lot tougher,5
2686,it does come with a screen protector which i don't have a problem trying to change songs,5
2687,it even comes with a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen,5
2688,it works better is 1 2 the price of an apple branded wired iphone 5 charger you get a wireless charger,5
2689,and since it charges using a standard micro-usb connector,5
2690,just as described fits my iphone 4s perfectly and i'm very happy with it it's not too bulky and it protects very well,5
2691,1 and 1 amp which makes it easy to charge my phone and ipad at the same time without trouble,5
2692,this case is a great choice if you want something that you can play music through this is the one,5
2693,i bought this cell phone case for a friend of mine and one for me we both are happy with it,5
2694,pro's it really does boost your signal and it is very easy to take on and off in general,5
2695,thank you for selling the product i would recommend this item to anyone looking,5
2696,honestly this is the best charger i've ever had the thing i like the most is that it not masculine looking,5
2697,the unit arrived with about a 3 4ths charge i plugged in my phone and it never made it through the next day,5
2698,after that you can simply put the phone in the holder without the volume going down to 0,5
2699,the charger has a usb plug on the side so you can charge your phone while using this cable,5
2700,and btw i tried their phone mount for cars and i'm very satisfied with the design aesthetics and performance of this device,5
2701,so far i like these the material is much better and it doesn't bother the screen performance,5
2702,i take this with me everywhere so i don't run out of juice half way through the day,5
2703,i have no complaints at all but will update this review if i find anything getting hung-up or crashing,5
2704,these cables work great and open up a whole new world of what android devices can do,5
2705,nicely made silicone-type material it doesn't add too much bulk and fits into her purse perfectly,5
2706,i have had this for several months and it has held up well,5
2707,amazing covermy wife she is using it and she is very happy happy sister i am happy too,5
2708,after dropping it a couple times on concrete and the phone isn't scratched,5
2709,you can also see the stipple pattern on the back of the case and serve as resting points,5
2710,oh and the word belkin is inset on the side of the case which makes it not as objectionable,5
2711,with the 2 amps port it charges my phone faster than my wall charger and it does it in my pocket,5
2712,anyways so that's just to let you know that i am very happy with this item from trident case company,5
2713,the casing is strong and the usb ports are nice and tight and works exactly as it should,5
2714,i have this one on my desk at the office and one to keep at home,5
2715,first of all you get two batteries for the price of one and at the promo cost they were basically free,5
2716,the usb mini port on the side is a power button to turn the unit back on,5
2717,a usb charger would be better but i got this for a co-worker and she loves it to death,5
2718,i had been so impressed with my old version i also got one for my husband for when he is doing house construction,5
2719,everything is recessed so you can place the phone face down without marring the screen,5
2720,right now i have this on pay-as-you-go phone on at t and it works flawlessly,5
2721,this one lasted longer than the charger that came with the phone when i bought it at the store,5
2722,charger works well and with the usb port i can charge the phone and ipad several times before a need a recharge,5
2723,the case is super cute and it fit my phone perfectly iphone4 i love this case,5
2724,overall i am very happy with this phone i can use it in my car or house is absolutley awesome,5
2725,in sum i'm very satisfied with this product and i am very pleased with them,5
2726,i was shopping for a while for a good extra battery for my phone and so far its working very well,5
2727,the phone does everything i want it to do and that is keep relevant the main reason you bought the phone,5
2728,i received a silver model and it has a very nice feel for your finger when using touch-screen,5
2729,you can also wear them under the ear or over the ear or in the ear device,5
2730,it has a lot of stretch so it can be used with any tripod including my existing gorillapod,5
2731,it has a great feel and texture and feels good in the hand the matte finish is nice to the touch,5
2732,it stays on securely and you are able to still use the touch screen with the phone in there which is a plus,5
2733,i'm always on the lookout for a good bluetooth headset,5
2734,i'll be picking up a case for my wife for her first fancy iphone 5s and she love it,5
2735,additionally you can use the nokia internet sharing feature to use your phone as a hot spot it really needs to be plugged in,5
2736,the magnetic piece keeps everything in place on the back of the phone in order for one handed use,5
2737,cable isn't able to deliver enough power to charge an ipad or other tablet but will do so very slowly,5
2738,for her birthday i ordered this case for her iphone and used it for quite a while,5
2739,the call quality is great on this phone and is much better than the slippery little slab the phone was naked,5
2740,i was worried the white would get dirty but i haven't had any problems carrying the phone in my pocket,5
2741,i've had it a couple of months now and it has proven to be just what it promised,5
2742,duration of the battery is fairly good as long as you remember to do that it's great,5
2743,i love the jelly glossy smooth feeling in the back of the case but you get used to it,5
2744,the call quality is really good and it is easy to synch up with your telephone pad or computer,5
2745,i've had the case for about a month now with no sign of failing,5
2746,i love the design and it comes with a stylus pen and screen protector,5
2747,this headset is the best i have tried so far and it is only 7,5
2748,the texture on the back of this case as well as the quality of the build,5
2749,diztronic cases in general are really the best way to go if you are replacing your screen on your smartphone this is a must have,5
2750,i bought this for my daughter because i have had the same cover on my phone for almost 18 months,5
2751,i've been using the titan for just over a month now and i'm absolutely in love with the purple and baby blue,5
2752,lightweight matte black look and doesn't make the phone feel bulky when i have it in my hands all that melts away,5
2753,this ionic guardian case offers great protection for your samsung galaxy note 2 the xtremeguard screen protectors will not disappoint,5
2754,i have no idea why this was added and really can't think of a bad thing to say about this,5
2755,don't shell out big bucks when you can get this one for a 1 4 of the price,5
2756,just hold down the button to turn it on for charging and to use the flashlight,5
2757,but it works very well for what i need it to do very well and i've had no issues with it so far,5
2758,nothing really negative to say about this case except that it's kind of difficult to take it out,5
2759,this case is very easy to put on and remove work highly recommend this product to any one who has reasonable head ear size,5
2760,so the first one i bought didn't fit the screen on my samsung galaxy note 2 and it works great,5
2761,outside on the cement road with this case on it and it did not break no scratch nothing,5
2762,this case is so cute i love the way it looks feels and the fact that it doesn't attract lint,5
2763,this is a decent case for the price you can't beat and the quality and size was just right,5
2764,i love this and will recommend it to anyone who is looking for a heavy duty case,5
2765,other than that is great and the price i paid for both was really worth the money,5
2766,great for going out with the girls for a night on the town or to minimize what you are holding,5
2767,it really is quite scratch resistant so i don't know why there are any negative reviews on this case,5
2768,i can't distinguish it from the one that i got with my phone and it works great,5
2769,additional notes a short press on the power button turns on the convenient built-in flashlight,5
2770,other than that i recommend this one for any one who is looking for quality and durability at a great price,5
2771,for those who are concerned about damage to the face of the phone and the buttons don't work while on call,5
2772,it was weird at first because i was trying to get up the protector to get a small piece of dirt under it,5
2773,i use them mainly for talking on the phone while driving earns you a nice ticket,5
2774,this phone is worth the money because there is nothing you can't do with symbian once you know the drill,5
2775,i rarely use my phone driving but it's nice to have the backup power ready for those times you need it,5
2776,but with this charger you can charge two items at the same time at 1a and 2,5
2777,i usually go bare bones with my phone so i decided to order the otterbox 77-21392 commuter case too,5
2778,pros pricesizelooksno built-in screen protectorcons no built-in screen protector but comes with an adhesive one,5
2779,these are for people who want to listen to their music through some quality wired headphones,5
2780,even though it can be moved easily i like the idea of having multiple protectors versus one high quality one,5
2781,i've only been using mine for about 2 months now and it's been a total rock star,5
2782,i have used mirrored screen protectors for my ipod for over a year now and i've recommended them to all my friends,5
2783,charges lots of devices at once and one of them can be a phone,5
2784,it had worked i expected it would and haven't had any issues in the past couple of days,5
2785,i think some of the reviews for this i decided to try it out on my nexus 7,5
2786,i had no problem placing the screen protector on my phone for over a year now and am constantly impressed by it,5
2787,the 928 has a slight curve on the edge of the screen and this also is a great help,5
2788,the red silicone cover has grips on the sides which makes it easier to hold on to for small hands like mine,5
2789,fits perfect and was very easy to install on my phone and i really like it alot,5
2790,i plugged in my android phone and my wife's ipad simultaneously when we travel together by car,5
2791,i have used all four ports on this charger at the same time and it saves me space in my outlets,5
2792,i love the fact that it has an open usb port so that you can charge the phone with or without a case on,5
2793,sometimes cheaper is better i also have an urban armor gear case and it slides in the tune belt easily,5
2794,i have another friend that has the orange one and he has dropped his phone and the case kept it protected,5
2795,in my case i have a 32 gb sd card and the phone accepted it instantly,5
2796,fits my iphone 5c perfectly and it is easy to take on an off when i need to,5
2797,i love a nice presentation it makes me feel like i am touching on the real glass,5
2798,i have been using it for about 2 weeks and so far it's holding up pretty well,5
2799,it syncs right to my phone and i don't even have to remove the phone from the case by pulling the left side out,5
2800,1 inchesas a fairly new owner of the new trent powerpak ultra 14000mah is a great back up,5
2801,pros great sound quality i don't really notice a degradation in finger contact,5
2802,actions speak louder than words i'm going to be buying it in more colors pretty soon,5
2803,no problems with this little charger from tudia and i like the way it looks and feel as if there is nothing on the screen,5
2804,i'm not sure how well it would protect the phone to some extent,5
2805,the cord is exactly what i was looking for and the price was amazing,5
2806,it could be just because the battery is new but so far i am very happy with the purchased of the hyperion extended battery,5
2807,i highly recommend purchasing this screen protector for your note 3 then this is the one to get,5
2808,i love that the case protects my phone well has a lip to protect the screen in case it's dropped on the screen,5
2809,i hope this will improve over time but its not a big problem for me because i use the lightning cable to charge the phone,5
2810,the 10 year warranty speaks a lot for the quality of the product and its low price those are inconsequential issues,5
2811,if i had one 34 gripe 34 it would be that it's like a smaller slightly lower-speced galaxy s3,5
2812,i like the fact that it has a little kick stand in the back of the case was white but it's not,5
2813,i travel quite a bit for work and it's nice to have charger with a usb connector for trips,5
2814,but when i used this for a few days i have found nothing wrong with it and i highly recommend it,5
2815,oxa 2600mah mini power bank is a very compact battery pack with plenty of power to charge any of the portable devices i use,5
2816,the upside of course is that you will not need to renew your contract with an unlocked phone like this,5
2817,as benchmarks will attest to the average person won't notice much of a change inside even with the booster correctly installed,5
2818,while my phone has a 3100 mah battery you have to keep in mind that nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for symbian,5
2819,the unit also has an led light on the side to show that the adapter is getting power,5
2820,i bought this for my new phone when i got it because i like to carry my phone in my pocket,5
2821,i've had mine about going for about a month and a half but the back is starting to peel,5
2822,they call it parabola and i'm not sure if a mean apple or android,5
2823,i have used it in class for about a week now and so far it performs as advertised,5
2824,screen is still very sensitive to the touch so there's no worry about being shocked from it falling in the water,5
2825,this is a durable case that goes on easily and fits perfectly but can be removed quickly if necessary,5
2826,i really can't feel it in my ear and it never unpaired or even got a nick,5
2827,it arrived on time and i didn't have any problems with this card at all,5
2828,the sound quality is great and there doesn't seem to be any problem at all,5
2829,display looks hd clear and does not take away from the looks of the phone at all,5
2830,i decided this morning that i would write a review for the case i've bought for my phone,5
2831,great battery so far great customer service i'm extremely satisfied with this case and i don't think that anyone can even argue otherwise,5
2832,bonus glue a small magnet on the right-hand side of the charger that little dark spot,5
2833,i recommend that if you get this case you will love it it's beautiful and so pretty,5
2834,this is one of the best cases that i have had for my htc one x,5
2835,distinguishing between apps and widgets took a little getting used to touchscreen and switching to other characters,5
2836,being able to easily remove the phone from the case i'm using,5
2837,the case it cute and i've had it for a month and its still in mint condition,5
2838,the screen protector fit perfectly on my new s5 really happy that i purchased this item as it is what i expected,5
2839,i don't text but i don't like to keep my phone in my pocket and i reach for it when i need it,5
2840,the joints are all free moving so you don't have to take the case off in order to charge the phone,5
2841,lastly it does not add much bulk to the phone yet feels like it has a lot more grip,5
2842,i would buy this case again and all my friends like it all openings are in the correct place the camera also,5
2843,i tested this product with both my ipad 2 and my iphone 4s at the same time,5
2844,really like it also liked the price and i would recommend this case over the otter box any day of the week,5
2845,i was able to get 13 hours while connected to 4 g lte full time with the display at about 50 %,5
2846,works like a charm and does what it is suppose to do so i have no complaints or regrets,5
2847,it was easy to install fits the phone with the extended battery just fit this case fine,5
2848,had this for a few months now and it is still holding up to a teenager,5
2849,we recently replaced this phone with the lgenv3 and even though it is a fingerprint magnet it looks and feels sleek,5
2850,it also charged my iphone 5s more then 3 times and my ipad mini twice before it runs out of juice,5
2851,i would buy this brand again but there is no need to worry if it will slide out,5
2852,so when i came across this i had to have it it is cheaper to get this things on amazon,5
2853,i've owned many phone cases and this case is one of several but she likes it,5
2854,i have a jell cover so i don't have a long cord hanging around my console,5
2855,i am very pleased with my purchase and best of all i can turn them off without unplugging them,5
2856,but on another note tech armor is the way to go for maximum compatibility with every phone you come across,5
2857,i have been using this charger since i got it and it still works and looks good to is a tribute to otterbox,5
2858,it will fit your ear trust me so you dont have to use your own fire wire to charge it,5
2859,i've purchased other covers similar to this and it fits the phone perfectly i am very happy with the stashback,5
2860,what i love about the case is that it takes away some of the beauty of the droid razr,5
2861,the part of the stylus that touches the screen is roughly the size of a wallet it fits in my jeans pocket no problem,5
2862,i was just looking for something that doesn't take away from the look of this phone or make it bulky,5
2863,it can be creaky sometimes but it protects the iphone so i don't have any issue as of yet i just got it,5
2864,i saw a few recommendations on this and decided to go for it despite reports of duds crazy risk-taker,5
2865,you go camping over night and need some power this is the unit for you i gave it 5stars for price function and features,5
2866,in addition to the two-piece design it also includes a screen protector which adds to the value so keep that in mind,5
2867,be aware that this charger does not come with a charging cable for the device itself,5
2868,since putting this case on i haven't had this problem at all,5
2869,i had many bluetooth devices and this by far has been the best i've tried so far and is inexpensive compared to others,5
2870,it just means you won't have to worry about it coming unclipped,5
2871,the portable charger it comes with doesn't increase the size of the phone in my opinion it feels more solid to me,5
2872,the ezopower 8 amp 40 watt 5 usb car charger is a must-have for anyone with a smartphone or tablet,5
2873,i charged two things at once a couple of times and didn't recieve any damage to my phone,5
2874,i was able to plus this device in my car and use it to charge my devices not admire it,5
2875,i have used both for 7 months now and i am very happy with its performance,5
2876,the instructions were clear and you can not tell there is a screen protector on my phone,5
2877,so i am thrilled that i finally have a headset that stayed on my ears while working out,5
2878,one of my tablets got charged to 100 % and the battery pack was down to 1 light 25 % full,5
2879,it makes a solid first impression when taken out of the package but it fits great on the phone,5
2880,i bought it for my raspberry pi and haven't had any issues in the past couple of days,5
2881,a note to idevice owners while it does come with a micro usb cable or charging block which is required for charging,5
2882,the biggest drawback is the size of the power bank is 4 x 1,5
2883,it took me a while to figure out how to put the phone into the case but everything fits like a glove,5
2884,much better than my skyrocket but i knew it would be because its not a rubber case,5
2885,they work exactly as required for both my samsung galaxy s4 and nexus 7 2013 at the same time,5
2886,i can't really i can't count how many times it has saved me,5
2887,they stick to the phone really well and i don't have to apply any sort of force to access the buttons,5
2888,my droid still slips in and out of my pocket all day long,5
2889,these ear buds are made with a soft gel like material that feels very soft and grippy to the touch,5
2890,i liked this charger as it can be used for both charging and using to charge my phone,5
2891,the otterbox commuter series case is by far the best for handling noise cancellation,5
2892,this is a really good looking and functional case for your iphone 5c then i would highly recommend this booster from wilson,5
2893,i was able to charge both my nexus 5 and nexus 7 as fast as its full sized brother,5
2894,5 excellent designcons none that i can think of disclosure i was supplied a sample for review and promised to give my honest opinion,5
2895,it's a good sized battery with a little bit of weight to it and it really feels well built,5
2896,i can slid it into my pocket and almost don't even realize it is a big phone until someone points it out,5
2897,the leather back case is by far the best i've ever used,5
2898,this is a wonderful gadget one of those nice to have accessories with a tablet device,5
2899,unlike many of the reviews i don't have any problem with this extremly well made product,5
2900,iphone but i've not had trouble getting both to charge at the same time two cell phones or one tablet,5
2901,the one thing that everyone needs to know is that this does not come with the actual button that you press i,5
2902,i didn't know there was a little switch on the side to make it easy to remove the tape,5
2903,i wrote a good message but right now i can tell you that the voice reception i hear is crystal clear,5
2904,bought these because they were so cheap and i'm very picky about my iphone cases and i love this ballistic,5
2905,it was ready out of the box and was so easy to set up and use right out of the box,5
2906,reason for purchase was to take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or talk on the phone,5
2907,i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who needs a new charger,5
2908,one is the car vents clip mount which i didn't think would happen with an external battery charger,5
2909,my research came up with few stand and for the price of this one that's what i was expecting,5
2910,your google e-mail is accessed on the phone and all the time looking like she was listening to the wall,5
2911,ive dropped my phone many times and this case has kept it in tact thank goodness,5
2912,the case is good looking and easy to put on your phone looks great and fits exactly what i needed,5
2913,although it does wrinkle at the edges of the phone if you use a case this arm band won't be what you want,5
2914,replaced the battery with this one and it works just as well as the apple brand,5
2915,i like that it has two usb ports on the top that are 2,5
2916,these films fit great and last long if you take care of it it'll treat your phone well,5
2917,it's not as bulky as most of the other batteries that i've used or come across,5
2918,this was a big deal because i didn't want to keep carrying around multiple chargers,5
2919,overall its a great product and i would buy another one of these products if i had to again,5
2920,i am so sold on this company i can not wait to try it out tonight at the gym,5
2921,chargers a galaxy s4 and galaxy note 3 at the same time i am charging my devices,5
2922,in my case i simply plugged it into my ipad charger and it was fully charged in less than an hour,5
2923,i would very pleased with the quality of this case it has a soft feel,5
2924,got these within days of ordering and i am very pleased with it and even ordered more,5
2925,i've tried many different bluetooth headsets in the past but this one is my favourite,5
2926,0 battery for about two weeks now and i am still liking it alot,5
2927,my 2 year old uses it and i do not have to wait for the battery to recharge,5
2928,the screen looks great through it and it doesn't seem to add much bulk to my new iphone 5,5
2929,it makes it easy to find in my bag or on the floor of the plane and you lose them,5
2930,it is a great choice for the price that was paid this is an exceptional product,5
2931,i love this caseit is a great product and i recommend this to anyone who is still using the thunderbolt,5
2932,overall i loved these things so much that i got several friends to purchase a set,5
2933,it works perfectly with iphone and the fact that it is a 5 pack for the price of a 3 pack,5
2934,i do not have a samsung galaxy tab but if i did i would not have that much of an issue with it,5
2935,on another note i don't really like the feel of the screen protector is also something i find very appealing,5
2936,only 1 usb port you would not want to charge both an ipad and a phone at the same time,5
2937,love the adjustable everything about it you can make it work with this case or spigen smart view plus works,5
2938,she put this on her phone as soon as she received it she sent me a picture of it,5
2939,will update if i decide to install it gives me peace of mind knowing my expensive phone's screen is protected,5
2940,i always like to have my phone in my hands constantly,5
2941,i have shopped around for cases and have yet to find one that has that type of suction,5
2942,the sound is perfect and it's small enough to fit in my purse,5
2943,between the fiber glass screen protector and this case i don't have to carry a charging cable with me where ever i go,5
2944,this case has just the right amount of 34 resistance 34,5
2945,what this case is great for is showing off the design of the iphone 5 and transferred it into this case,5
2946,regarding price i don't think you can do better than this one and i've tried quite a few in the past few years,5
2947,i took the case off and put it back on and haven't had any problems,5
2948,case looks great but don't expect it to be effective with that device,5
2949,this case is a perfect fit not too bulky and doesn't add too much bulk and has a really nice grip on the sides,5
2950,it arrived in the mail a few days ago and having had it on my phone for 2 days now and the smell has faded,5
2951,i am not a paid reviewer batexwireless is a great company and they have made another great product once again,5
2952,the battery pack is small enough to carry around in your purse for everyday emergencies,5
2953,i have 20 cases and this is by far the best usb wall charger i've ever used,5
2954,the option that goes inside my ear fits perfectly and i never worry about it because the otter provides such supreme protection,5
2955,three things i would like to figure out what to do with all of them,5
2956,this is best low price 6 ft cable i've found on the market for the iphone 5 hands down,5
2957,love this case easy to put them on and take them off repeatedly but this case does not do that at all,5
2958,9830 very compact for travel if you need to take a written note or sign a document,5
2959,it protects the back and sides of the phone and provides a great deal of protection for the screen,5
2960,they fit very well i have dropped my phone several times and it was not even scratched,5
2961,i've dropped my phone a couple of times in the house on my coffee table,5
2962,it has a kick stand so you can set the phone down screen facing downward without worry,5
2963,just finished a 3 day trip and was able to keep my galaxy s3 alive for 2 days,5
2964,these arrived very quickly and i was able to apply the screen protector with no issues,5
2965,will buy again if needed cable is holding up much better than previously purchased defender cases for my previous iphone 4s,5
2966,i have paid almost 30 dollars for invisishield screen protectors in the past and this is by far the best phone i ever owned,5
2967,wherever you choose to place this you can be sure that it won't scratch it at all,5
2968,i bought a few but this is the one i use most of the time but i am still happy i got this,5
2969,not only can it charge tow devices at the same time but the maximum overall output will be limited to 3,5
2970,love it use it a lot convenient to carry my i d and debit card would fall out but it's not happening,5
2971,i had to unplug it from the outlet in order to be able to return it without question if i changed my mind,5
2972,love the case pink is my favorite color and the price was right so theres no complaining,5
2973,i love it it does just what it is supposed to and does it well,5
2974,i get battery backups like these as gifts for my friends as they upgraded their phones,5
2975,i've used brand before and have never had a problem with skinomi products that i can recall,5
2976,after purchasing many different kinds of cases for my s3 and the spigen models are my favorite,5
2977,i never change the screen protector on my phone since i revived it,5
2978,0 in 367 ppi 2 gb ram microsd up to 64 gb 13 mp 2mp exynos 5 octa 5420 quad-core 1,5
2979,when you place the phone on a table the screen won't get scratched if it's falling onto a flush surface,5
2980,this is well built and for the price i would say this is one of the best decisions i made for my wireless devices,5
2981,she keeps it in her purse and she loves the color,5
2982,i have had this battery for over a week now and i am very satisfied with it,5
2983,and because i am also cheap and don't want to buy brand name i will buy from ismooth first,5
2984,i got along with it so well that i decided to buy this instead and it was great,5
2985,it's not too bulky so it fits in my pocket better or in the side pouch of my backpack,5
2986,the case has protection for all the buttons and ports so you don't have to worry about my phone ever running out of battery,5
2987,my only concern is losing it so i have to find a way to keep your adapter handy at all times,5
2988,i didn't experience any problems with the part where you place your phone until you hear it make a snapping sound,5
2989,love the fact that it comes apart so that i can attach the mic then the camera is covered by the case,5
2990,on epic the amoled screen ensures you don't need to charge your phone and a spare battery at the same time,5
2991,there is the sticky gum that is left on the phone but it does not hold my phone very well and its suction was weak,5
2992,i bought this holster case for my wife's samsung galaxy s5 and i love them both,5
2993,the fit is perfect and this is easily one of the best phone cases i have ever had,5
2994,the one other great thing about this case is that you can not charge the powermat and use your device at the same time,5
2995,i got big hands so the added size makes it more comfortable to use the iphone and leaves no fingerprints on it,5
2996,two weeks ago i left it in my pants pocket and i really like the matte look of the pink,5
2997,i forgot to mention it has a quad core processor chugging away at 1,5
2998,i have had this on the phone for almost a year and a half ago and my entire family used it,5
2999,the bonus it that the electrical contacts folds in making it easy to carry in the nice carrying nylon vented bag,5
3000,i assure you that this set is very good quality and i am feeling very worth of my money,5
3001,even though it's a little tall the quality of the case is very good and it comes with a great value,5
3002,not a lot of protection on the front but it's not that big of a deal to me,5
3003,the wireless remote slips in and out of the case which i think is how a custom case should fit,5
3004,my galaxy note 3 is quite safe inside this case and i don't have to mess with a face frame,5
3005,my wife and i bought a couple of these in different colors just to change it up from time to time,5
3006,i really love this screen protector i don't have to worry about the batteries dying on me,5
3007,cons although it isn't bulky at all my phone won't fit in my charging cradle when it's in this case,5
3008,i noticed that it takes slightly longer to charge my phone with the battery pack and it worked perfectly,5
3009,was in great condition and didn't have any trouble putting the case on it was fairly easy,5
3010,0 charging slot on the charger it charges my phone in no time at all and the battery isn't too expensive to replace,5
3011,the phone is big enough as it is so i didn't want a bulky case on top of it,5
3012,i bought it for my son's 5s and it's such a great thing to have for blackberry users,5
3013,speck claims that this horn will make the iphone's built-in speakers sound a little muffled with the case on,5
3014,so i have had this for a couple of years now and never had an issue,5
3015,i've seen quite a few other cases and this one is by far the best case i own,5
3016,first off i 8217ll say that the sound quality of phone calls is pretty bad,5
3017,it was super easy to put on my phone and i love the design would buy it again,5
3018,yes extended batteries make the phone more bulky so get it if you don't know what it is but i really recommend this,5
3019,haven't had the separation issue yet but if i do i will come back and change my review,5
3020,the lack of protection for the back of the phone to show while protecting it from scratches,5
3021,the screen is so smooth and a lot better than the previous cheap headset she had,5
3022,one nice thing about the otterbox is that it doesn't have led lights,5
3023,it's solid and somewhat bulky than what i'm used to but i'm also used to larger power banks,5
3024,i've had it for months now and it hasn't let me down,5
3025,you can continue to use the phone while it's clipped onto my bag,5
3026,love the bright color which makes it easy to spot in purse or on a counter top,5
3027,they include everything you need to put this screen protector on was more than i imagined,5
3028,to be honest though it doesn't seem to have a case on,5
3029,this case fits perfectly and doesn't add a lot to your phone like some other cases can,5
3030,the only thing as with any phone that has a mini-usb port for charging and the first two have each 2 amps,5
3031,however the lack of an indicator light isn't a big deal as you will understand what they are trying to explain,5
3032,i bought it for scratch protection but be aware that it is a bit thicker and much heavier,5
3033,since it is interchangeable i hope they come out with one for that device,5
3034,but thankfully they did get rid of the over-the-top case designs i have seen,5
3035,wires seem sturdy and is one solid cable all the way down to the back plate starting from the screen,5
3036,i hemmed and hawed about ordering a case for my new galaxy s3 that would cling to my pocket lining,5
3037,it took me some time to get used to it but it works great,5
3038,the anti glare feature affects the clarity of the screen a bit but it's super smooth and resists fingerprints and smudges,5
3039,also of note it doesn't add much thickness or weight to my iphone,5
3040,bluetooth setup was a breeze and i didn't have any problems at all with this,5
3041,it takes some force to get the swivel moving but at least it doesn't use some kind of proprietary cable,5
3042,i settled on this one and it's the best i've seen and gets your device charged super fast,5
3043,buy a portable dvd player and this headset and you will be able to answer them 34 it does a great job,5
3044,it can also be removed should you want to use your own headset or if you don't mind the added bulk,5
3045,i had purchased 2 different cases in the hopes that i would have better luck with a name brand product,5
3046,it is tidier when connecting to a laptop and you do not have to dig into your bag to use the stylus,5
3047,it is small and unobtrusive so i can use it in the evening while in bed without worrying about the charge,5
3048,i cut it off and problem solved i dont feel like its going to fall out of the hand,5
3049,since it is connected via the lighting port you can charge your phone with or without a case and holds it firmly,5
3050,it was clear from this video that ismooth has put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed,5
3051,the pink color isn't as bright as the picture shows at least on my computer screen,5
3052,this is a oem htc battery which is always the way to go because they're always the cheapest,5
3053,i assume you're looking here for the best bang for the buck available for my new phone,5
3054,this case looks just like it does in the description and i love the feel and the color best case i ever bought,5
3055,for a minimalist case this spigen is one of the best brands to get for a phone case,5
3056,anker has kept in constant contact with me to make sure i was satisfied with the product,5
3057,i am hoping this is an exact duplicate of the battery that came with my phone,5
3058,the music will continue to play your songs but you won't be able to use it much because i returned the nokia lumina 900,5
3059,the only problem i find with it is it does not come with a screen protector so buy one when you buy the phone,5
3060,i was very pleased when i got this case in the mail today and it's amazing,5
3061,love the ease of putting it on and removing it is very simple,5
3062,not the best quality but you can not go wrong with the defender case,5
3063,it's a tight fit and taking the phone out of the case to connect it to my car auxillary,5
3064,this 2 port charger will charge both my iphone and my fiance's blackberry at the same time,5
3065,i had an incase slider for my iphone 4 my wife's iphone 5 her ipad 1 and my ipad mini,5
3066,this case is very basic and works very well with my iphone and now my iphone is safe,5
3067,the only con i can possibly think of is that it doesn't cover the hardware volume and power buttons,5
3068,the case is slim so it doesn't add bulk to the phone this one is perfect,5
3069,does what it is made for seems to be of good quality and fits perfectly in my dhd,5
3070,i have the samsung droid charge and that is about as big as the lip on the diztronic case was,5
3071,i have big hands and i can tell you that the voice reception i hear is crystal clear,5
3072,i tend to carry my phone in my pocket and forgot about it,5
3073,it seemed to take forever to get here but it does what it needs to do and is cute too,5
3074,sure it costs more but i can't tell any difference between me talking on this headset and using the phone,5
3075,tried the spigen slim armor case and i loved it but the buttons were difficult to push,5
3076,after applying this protector it makes me feel like i don't have to use two hands especially for putting it on,5
3077,i am so pleased with my purchase and i will not hesitate to purchase from them again and i'm sure i will,5
3078,the best part is the attached lightning plug so you don't need to look at the thing while you are driving,5
3079,the only caveat i have is that if you drop it in the water,5
3080,this anti-glare screen protector is better than the ones you have to plug in separately,5
3081,i will order this one again in different colors i like to have a variety of cases for your cell as i do,5
3082,there are more substantial cases but they cost twice as much at the time of this review that works for me,5
3083,charges my phone just fine and i don't think it will be a problem,5
3084,it holds the charge as well as the original maybe better,5
3085,and doesn't add too much bulk to your note 3,5
3086,the mount grips my phone tightly to keep it in place and not risk slipping off a desk and busting it,5
3087,i put the first case on the white s3 and it gives you a great interface,5
3088,i did not receive a response for a few days so i spent some time playing around with it,5
3089,i have been very impressed with all the amazonbasics products i've tried have been well made and great bargains,5
3090,the case holds the bigger battery in place nicely as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it,5
3091,i would recommended this produce to my family and friends who have iphones that need to protect them,5
3092,in the end i settled on this case and i have directed them all to amazon and spigen,5
3093,perfectly covers the cell it feels good to the touch and holds up well,5
3094,with a fully battery i was able to charge my samsung galaxy s4 smartphone with both slots without any issues,5
3095,that equals a full charge in less than an hour and it works wonderfully,5
3096,it gets charged in about two hours and you do not need to plug it into a wall to use its power,5
3097,it need about 4 hours to fully charge the battery and the battery will stay in snugly,5
3098,it takes about a month to come in but it is well worth the money i completely recommend this one for the lumia 1020,5
3099,since it is the long haul version it is a little bulky but i'd rather it be tight than loose,5
3100,in fact i am happier with this purchase than any other phone i have used to include the wall charger and usb 3,5
3101,highly recommend for super protection from damage as well as being able to do more battery intensive activities without hesitation,5
3102,i have fumbled with the phone a couple of times and it is still in one piece,5
3103,i have had this charger for a few days but it was great,5
3104,i work at a radio shack and toss my phone on the holder and it's sticks there,5
3105,the power bank offers the ability to charge two devices simultaneously theeasyacc 5000mah 2,5
3106,just got my stereo earphones i am very happy with the price and value of this purchase,5
3107,both batteries took about 6 hours to charge from 0 to 100 % in about 5-6 hours in good sunlight,5
3108,nothing else can describe it better than the fact that it is very slim yet seems to protect well,5
3109,i've been using mine for about 5 months now and i don't regret one minute buying it,5
3110,a product sample was provided by the manufacturer in exchange for doing a thorough review of the product,5
3111,i do highly recommend this case to anyone especially if you have a 34 pageant baby 34 in your house,5
3112,i've also found that the charger that came with my phone fits perfectly so i don't need to worry about this anymore,5
3113,replaced the oem battery with this one and it's almost as good as the jabra stone i use most of the time,5
3114,i then tried it on my galaxy note 3 phone and tab 3 10,5
3115,but it really doesn't interfere with the touch function of the iphone,5
3116,it will tell you the battery life level every time you turn it on it will go into pairing mode automatically,5
3117,i bought it for someone's else and it work right out of the box or break after a few uses,5
3118,if there is any issue in the future i will update this review to reflect them,5
3119,i have to say this is one of the best cell phone products i've ever purchased,5
3120,awesome case that shows off the beauty of my white iphone to be seen,5
3121,the rubber is thick but not so much that it doesn't allow the cover to close,5
3122,if however you plug your ipad into the apple port and plug the iphone into the android port,5
3123,i got this case 6 months ago and it still works and provides good charging,5
3124,0a which you can use simultaneously if you need to charge 2 devices at the same time and only use a single adapter,5
3125,i bought this for my mom for her iphone 4s and she loves it got it for her birthday,5
3126,worked like it should just as fast as the one that came with the gnex phone,5
3127,i really like the rubberized paint it feels good in my hand and the buttons are all perfectly aligned with the cover buttons,5
3128,the only way i can see that there's a screen protector on because it fully covers the screen,5
3129,i was seeking something that could be used to charge both my iphone 4s and ipad 4th gen over the few days,5
3130,i've been using this extended battery for about 2 weeks now and have encountered no problem at all,5
3131,i've even dropped it a few times and the case doesn't even pop off or break on me,5
3132,of course i was disappointed due to the fact that the moto x uses virtual buttons,5
3133,i really like this phone holder i use it with an iphone 4 and now 5 both with cases,5
3134,the unit is so lightweight and comfortable that i forget that i have it between my legs while i'm driving,5
3135,i am using the over the ear hook and it does not interfere with l-shaped headphones nor blocks any iphone controls,5
3136,there is also a charging port on the inner side of the left arm behind swinging mini door,5
3137,thi case is very sturdy and it's a perfect fit for my s3,5
3138,i dropped my phone a week ago and wanted the exact same charger that came with my phone worked just fine,5
3139,i needed a replacement battery for my samsung galaxy vibrant from tmobile to leave at work,5
3140,it come with a couple different inserts so you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc,5
3141,the case was a great deal and does a great job protecting the phone from scratches bumps and nicks,5
3142,crisp and clear this handset adaptor made my cell phone much more comfortable to use with this case on than bare phone,5
3143,i take it with me when i'm on the road and unable to charge,5
3144,i would buy one myself if they came out with a new version of itunes with easy user interface,5
3145,i already dropped the phone a few times and haven't had any issues with this charger,5
3146,before i knew about skinomi i used dry-apply screen protectors that are crystal clear mind you,5
3147,i thought at first that it might not be as secure as i'd like but i still really like it,5
3148,my first attempt was a little crooked but i was able to reposition it without a problem,5
3149,i used this charger to charge my phone and ipod at the same time,5
3150,been using this for a couple of months and it's still in great condition,5
3151,i also charged my note 3 and my wife's is and 4s iphone,5
3152,i can see my screen clearly and there are 3 in the pack and you can replace it as needed,5
3153,i've had this phone now for over a month and it's still looking good and has protected my phone,5
3154,i give the juice box s1 5 stars for its high capacity reliability good build quality and efficiency,5
3155,she likes this case a lot and it protects the phone really well and feels good when you're holding it,5
3156,it matches me perfectly it is exactly what it said it was going to be here in about 7-8 days,5
3157,the kickstand is by far one of the best cases i've found for my sgs3,5
3158,the case was exactly was i was looking for when i ordered a case,5
3159,it will extend the useful life of your phone so you don't have to carry around a compact i just use my phone,5
3160,i have a couple cases for my iphone 5 but this one has become my daily case protection,5
3161,after using the product i would definitely recommend the product to others as long as you don't put it on right,5
3162,the price is unbeatable very cheap but the case doesn't look cheap at all and i like the flat cables a lot,5
3163,it is cheap and so it is worth it if you want to take screenshots and get free wireless tethering,5
3164,i then depleted the entire power of both the case and the battery pack compliments the ipad well,5
3165,it works very well with my phone and provides plenty of power to keep you going on those battery draining days,5
3166,it's still somewhat bulky but i've found it much easier to carry around with you as opposed to large crab like holders,5
3167,the left bottom rest swings out of the way for using the headset to listen to music,5
3168,i purchased this phone before thanksgiving and i am so pleased with these i hope to order more later on,5
3169,i bought this for my mother-in-law to use while running he loves it,5
3170,otterbox doesn't offer a lumia 925 model so i was thrilled to find this sim card at such a low price,5
3171,i'd definitely recommend this stylus if you're looking for one that's not a fake try them,5
3172,i have been using this device pretty regularly for the past few weeks and it is working well for me,5
3173,great bass and treble response lighter weight stay in my ears better and more comfortably than the motorola as well,5
3174,i've had this charger for over a week now and have completely deserted my nexus s,5
3175,and i am forever dropping my phone on the floor couple of times,5
3176,this is not my first anker product so i am familiar with the operating system and it's quirks,5
3177,something that i really like about the case is how it comes together,5
3178,there is a small lip around the edges of the phone incase she were to drop it,5
3179,i love that it has a usb port so you can plug in your own cable,5
3180,i would recommend the case for the price and the color was not disappointing,5
3181,i was shopping for a while for a good extra battery for my phone and so far its working very well,5
3182,it's a little annoying to carry in a pocket but useful when you know you'll be away for a while,5
3183,a nice simple stylish case that wraps around the phone and provides some shock protection,5
3184,the raised rubberized bezel around the face of the phone which gives it an additional layer of protection,5
3185,it is not cumbersome and i am able to use the same usb cable that just about every other mobile device uses,5
3186,nonetheless they do need to be charged and if you spend a lot of money on screen protectors for all my smart phones,5
3187,with all the devices i own i can never have too many cables for my iphone and ipad,5
3188,this charger will give me peace of mind for my phone,5
3189,i have no dropped my phone so i can't really say that about my other chargers whether oem or generic,5
3190,i have had this product for a few weeks and it is working well with good recharging speed and multiple item capability,5
3191,the only drawback is that it doesn't have as much grip as some of the other cases out there but it's actually solid,5
3192,i know have the iphone 5 but when i had the iphone 4s so i ordered this one,5
3193,this dual-purposeampen new hybrid 2-in-1 stylusis what brought me back to buy this for my galaxys iii,5
3194,the only other gripe i have is that the microphone doesn't work as well as it used to,5
3195,i will be upgrading soon so i don't want to attribute that to this review,5
3196,i've had this now for a few weeks and have been experimenting with cases along the way,5
3197,i have been using plantronics products for the last 5 years and this one by far is the best i've ever used,5
3198,i was skeptical at first about the galaxy s3 because i was not sure how the pen would make the stylus better,5
3199,i had some problem with some cases where the buttons are hard to push on the sides but i don't use those,5
3200,what's great this is very small about the size of a wallet and weighs about as much as my phone inside it's case,5
3201,i bough it for my girlfriend and she loved it plus it was not expensive at all and came in great time,5
3202,this is the same as the one that came with it but still a great pen to have,5
3203,the case is thick enough to protect the phone from scratches in pockets and minor bumps or drops,5
3204,it fits and it does what it is suppose to do charge his phone,5
3205,the only draw back is i haven't been able to get on 4 g anywhere in south maryland,5
3206,overall a great investment and for the price i will be getting more of these later on,5
3207,i would recommend this style of case to everyone it provides a lot of protection for the phone very similar to otterbox commuter,5
3208,it adds girth to the phone but not nearly as much as some of its competitors,5
3209,it just keeps getting better and better and i have not had a single minute without my phone and no more airplane mode,5
3210,this particular battery unlike most has two usb ports to charge two devices at once is perfect,5
3211,i did not want to spend a ton of money this i really enjoyed,5
3212,i've dropped it a few times but the phone fits perfectly and the case is stylish and cute,5
3213,retains the nfc ability that i use often and seems to hold a charge just fine after weeks of not being used,5
3214,this is a nice add for an ipad or any other device with a need for a 2 amp charger,5
3215,i ruined mine by trying to jam a slim case on my phone and still connect to the accessory,5
3216,it is of quality make durable and it doesn't look like a brick like i thought it would,5
3217,the case fits the phone perfectly and allows you to see the screen as crisply as without,5
3218,it's a cable so i'm not sure what else you can say about it,5
3219,the only problem that may arise is the thickness of the plastic part of the case covers the sides of the phone not the back,5
3220,just put your phone in the holder you can still plug it into the usb port and then press the power button to start charging,5
3221,i followed the instructions to a tee and you shouldn't have any problems getting a bubble-free screen protector,5
3222,i fly a lot and wanted to be able to plug my devices while on my desktop,5
3223,these earbuds are of good quality and connected very quickly to my android phone and tablet in seconds,5
3224,best cost-benefit deal i could find to protect the screen of my iphone and to help keep glare down when outside,5
3225,comparing these pairs with the original samsung ear buds that came with my phone for calls when away from the office,5
3226,it auto connects every time as long as i have this item charged when i leave,5
3227,the colors don't get dirty and it fits comfortably in my small ears which is great,5
3228,i managed to run my laptop for about 5-6 hours a day with no battery issues,5
3229,the cutouts are where they should be and i like that the color is close to the color of the cobalt theme,5
3230,this protector is durable and it was easy to apply and protects the phone great,5
3231,it has never failed me and i use it almost daily for either running or biking,5
3232,at 10 000 mah you don't need to worry about my son dropping my phone,5
3233,feel is amazing grip is really good the phone doesn't slide around everywhere like it has a tendency to do,5
3234,i have been using for about 2 months now and so far so good,5
3235,i like that it covers the whole outside and has a ridge to keep the screen from touching the surface you are laying it on,5
3236,i purchased my galaxy s4 when they first came out and were made made by duracell and energizer,5
3237,the color is nice the holes are in the right places and the power volume buttons are fully covered and protected,5
3238,it's very small small enough to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great,5
3239,by the way it fits great with that screen protector so i don't have to remember to carry one charger everywhere you go,5
3240,nice to increase plug space and be able to charge my phone at t htc one 4 times already,5
3241,when you turn it off the unit will tell you it's connected and when a call arrives,5
3242,like most i was hesitant at first but once i put it on the iphone i was impressed,5
3243,makes for a great slim case for your htc one m8 this is the one,5
3244,if you need just one or two extra charges to get you through the day so why not get one of those,5
3245,none of the sparkles have fallen off and it's been about a week,5
3246,i got this for my ipad and it's really cute it's silicone and wraps around your case front to back,5
3247,this product was offered to me in exchange for an honest and thorough review,5
3248,case works well solid hasn't cracked or chipped the case is still in tact its more durable than i expected,5
3249,some people might consider it bulky but i don't mind it is not a big deal,5
3250,as a slim case i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a samsung charger,5
3251,i'm very clumsy and drop my phone a lot and the case protects the sides and the screen,5
3252,i have been looking for a while for a extended battery for my note 2 and now use this uag as my daily driver,5
3253,it was super to be able to charge 2 ipads at the same time and charge my cellphone,5
3254,the quality is very good and it has a great battery life but it is great to have a spare at such a reasonable price,5
3255,it fits very snug on my phone and it's been a few months and it still looks brand new,5
3256,this product is great and worked well during my trip out of town when i lost my high power dual port usb car charger,5
3257,the anker will give us enough additional juice to fully charge an iphone almost 3 1 2 times,5
3258,the anker battery fits perfect and i will update this review if i hear of any issues with it,5
3259,thank you we have been trying since dec to find a good case for gnex that would match the phone quality,5
3260,overall this is a great product from a company that continues to be one of my favorite cases,5
3261,the camera and flash ports do a good job of keeping your tunes from bothering other people,5
3262,i love the feature where i can listen to my music and never have to worry that i misplaced it,5
3263,they are easy to use and apply cause no loss of touch sensitivity and not too sticky when swiping my finger across it,5
3264,the front lip covering the rim around the front of the phone that should keep the glass off of surfaces,5
3265,yes it does have minimal protection on the top and bottom but after a few tries i figured it out,5
3266,the way i wanted it however when i ordered it i thought the line was a reflection of the photographer,5
3267,i also like that i can listen to audiobooks and pandora too through it,5
3268,wasnt exactly what i expected but its a great case and i like that i can play music while it is in the dock,5
3269,but when i charged it with mynew trent 10w 5v 2a dual port charger imp90c will charge just about any device on the go,5
3270,turned out great for him and it actually works as long as you have the room in front of the outlet,5
3271,if you use your phone w o a case you'll need to use the charging adapter that came with your iphone ipod,5
3272,also the plastic extended battery back panel looks and feels exactly like the apple cables that came with my ipad,5
3273,it does not add bulk or weight in her words it feels like there is no screen protector on at all,5
3274,i've used dozens of different types of screen protectors for my various devices and these are the best by far,5
3275,i was looking for a great case that doesn't draw attention to itself,5
3276,i love how it is small enough to fit in my pocket and i kept breaking the clips on the holder,5
3277,been using these for a week in an htc evo 4 g and i no longer had my equipment protection from sprint,5
3278,i've used this for the last year or so and they all have their pros and cons,5
3279,definitely not top of the line but for the price it's super cute and worth it,5
3280,i can have crystal clear bose sound and i don't need to press down hard as with other cases,5
3281,i like the fact that you can charge two devices at the same time,5
3282,n7000 hasn't done this so i'm guessing that this is due to the slight curve in the note ii screen,5
3283,1 wash your hands and make sure you are in a clean work area follow the instructions take your time and you will be happy,5
3284,too bad the headphones that came with it i can't seem to get facebook to pull into the menu,5
3285,this is an awesome little device and i would recommend it to anyone seeking this kind of product,5
3286,granted the juicypack is not the most powerful external battery but it's also not the most secure fit,5
3287,i had just received the tech armor screen protector and it went on easy but the seller was awesome,5
3288,i'm very pleased with this case and would highly recommend the supcase to anyone that is looking for a good quality functional mount,5
3289,i have had this item for some time now and have yet to lose any of the jewels,5
3290,1 amps or 1 amp per port when using both ports at the same time for charging two devices at once,5
3291,otterbox doesn't offer a lumia 925 model so i was thrilled to find this one on amazon for under 40,5
3292,you can use these several hours a day for several days and still have half my battery on it,5
3293,after getting an android phone i wasn't sure what to expect but this is great,5
3294,some fit snugly and others not and feel like they are going to break if you drop it on a floor,5
3295,it really does have a great feel to it and does not show fingerprints,5
3296,it is slimmer and lighter and i don't feel like it's going to slip out of your hand,5
3297,99 and i wanted to get this as a gift for someone and they seem to enjoy,5
3298,i highly recommend this case it offers good protection for your iphone as it is water-proofish,5
3299,the adaptor has two usb plug-ins so you can charge two devices at 1 amp or one at 2,5
3300,no problems pulling the device from my jean pocket with this case on it and the phone slides in and out of pockets with ease,5
3301,i would recommend these screen protectors to anyone who wants to protect their gs3 in a slim profile,5
3302,i previously tried the luvvitt cristal case for the iphone 5 and this time i'm satisfied,5
3303,there is enough of an edge around the screen to protect it when you lay your phone screen down without the screen touching the surface,5
3304,i have had this for over a month now and the screen protector is still doing it's job,5
3305,after receiving a boxwave stylus i was in search of a different type of screen protector,5
3306,3 soft firmware update dropped last night for those of you who got a 3 g handed down or practically free,5
3307,5 34 when folded that has two pockets one for the moonstone and another for cables,5
3308,i picked up two of these and i have been very pleased with the otterbox case and is just right,5
3309,it's great product to charge your phone the only issue i had with this tool is that it is stamped steel,5
3310,n7000 hasn't done this so i'm guessing that this is due to the slight curve in the note ii screen,5
3311,i've had it for over a year now and i haven't touched it once,5
3312,that is unless you're sure you can keep the phone on your belt and not take up pocket space,5
3313,i love green and it's bright color makes it easy to find even when buried in my storage console,5
3314,its tight fitting it does get loose after a year or so of normal use so i replaced it with this one,5
3315,great speaker but i really don't feel like it's going to slip through my fingers,5
3316,since the tip retracts into the pen it is less likely to get anything sticky or gooey on it,5
3317,i travel a lot internationally and am very happy with this purchase i plan on buying more of these for my friends,5
3318,i am very impressed especially since this is my first experience with qi technology and i am very happy with my purchase so far,5
3319,this case is absoutely adorable it has diamonds all over the place but it 8217s not a huge deal,5
3320,it has 2 usb ports so you can charge two devices at one time using the two slots,5
3321,i am one to take great care of my phone so this is a breath of fresh air,5
3322,outside on the cement road with this case on it and there was no damage to the screen or any dents in the phone,5
3323,you should be able to fully charge my galaxy s4 and my wife's droid razr without any noted issues,5
3324,note i was provided a sample for testing and impartial review,5
3325,the best feature might be how easy it is to get it to stick to the suction part,5
3326,i have about a dozen cases and this is the only one that gets you attention from other people around you,5
3327,the battery life doesn't seem as long as the stock battery and came fully pre-charged,5
3328,i love my screen protectors and they fit perfectly on my iphone 4 and went on with minimal bubbles,5
3329,i did have a long sleeve shirt on today so i can't comment on charge times with 2 devices attached,5
3330,protects is cute i like the feel of it in my hand and when i slip it into my pocket,5
3331,discovery 925 is very comfortable to wear though it did take a few weeks to come to me from china,5
3332,i had concerns that i would not be able to charge my phone ipad together over night,5
3333,1a a micro usb input port for charging the battery itself,5
3334,i knew that the battery would be a good fit for the camera etc,5
3335,pros very handsome drive that's simple to remove and put back on and doesn't break,5
3336,for one it was the easiest screen protector installation i have ever had the pleasure of buying,5
3337,not sure how it got there but i was easily able to get it out with the included sticker,5
3338,this thing is amazing and it fits like a glove but i just wish it came with other adaptors,5
3339,battery life is usually much more of an issue with my car though than the charger itself,5
3340,i used the second one for the iphone a few times as well and it is still protecting my phone,5
3341,paid triple what this costs for other cases and this one is the best fit finish and balance between protection and portability,5
3342,only dual port if you have a device that charges with a micro usb cable which is used to charge the battery itself,5
3343,all the stamps and info match my original that came with the phone and i am sure it will work equally well with the ipads,5
3344,i love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very nice material for this purpose,5
3345,i'm really happy with the case and it does not bother me at all because i know the phone is well protected,5
3346,i received an email with a video and also instructions on how to apply the said protector are included as well,5
3347,the system is easy to use and very simple to operate,5
3348,i get compliments everyday and would recommend it to anyone who loves cases like these,5
3349,oh also something that didn't add too much bulk to the back of the phone to prevent scratching of the aluminum,5
3350,the order was perfect the product is as described and arrived on time without any problems,5
3351,there 8217s plenty of days when you don 8217 t want to pay the extra cash just yet,5
3352,really good 2 part case a little bulky but is to be expected with the number of cycles i put them through,5
3353,i've been using the titan for just over a month now and there's not a single scratch on the screen,5
3354,its small but the volume is great and it seems to self heal with small scratches,5
3355,as a plus it has a cool blue light that glows to let you know when it's charging and if it needs charging,5
3356,with that being said even i was worried that it wouldn't sit well with the protector,5
3357,it is clear for both you and the person you are talking to thinks you are alone in a quiet office,5
3358,i have already dropped my phone and this case has protected my phone from several drops,5
3359,it fits my samsung note 2 very well and makes the phone easier to hold it protects the screen and the back,5
3360,unlike many generic brands this cable appears to work just as well as the one that came with my phone,5
3361,i wish i had one of these for my iphone 4s and i can say is,5
3362,i used plantronics on-line support to see if i could get it to leak but it was a no go,5
3363,overall i'm quite happy with the case and would recommend it to others that want a nice mount for their phones,5
3364,all five of these ports have the poweriq technology which means i don't have time or patients to keep grabbing my ipod,5
3365,the sound on the model right above these is just a little bit better than the model below them bth220,5
3366,the duracell backup battery is about the size and weight of a higher-capacity charger,5
3367,it would deplete quickly even though i don't use it often but great when i need it,5
3368,i think it also has some lights on it but i don't see it being work more than what i paid materials,5
3369,this is especially handy for the times you're on the go need to charge your power hungry devices,5
3370,when i first got it i did slide it in and out of the holster easily but feels secure at the same time,5
3371,if anything happens to the durability of the item i will be sure to update if its chipping but it looks amazing to me,5
3372,some people might prefer genuine leather but you can't even tell the protector is even on the phone,5
3373,i have not dropped in a raging river or anything like that but i can honestly say it is waterproof,5
3374,and as i said before after a while you 8217ll get used to just tapping the screen until the phone responds,5
3375,i have used a number of bluetooth headset in the past and this one is hands down the best one i have ever owned,5
3376,they have a higher charge rating and thus charge most devices much faster than the charger you get with a device,5
3377,i've had this one 2 weeks now and i am going to buy more for my family once they saw mine,5
3378,it's bendable and super easy to put on and protects the unit in case you drop it,5
3379,other than that i recommend this case you won't be sorry if you order this,5
3380,secondly this is by far the best bluetooth headset that i have ever used or even seen advertised,5
3381,the verdict i was able to charge the nexus 4 from 60 % to 100 % and itimed it as 35 minutes,5
3382,each of the three devices was charging steadily for the two hours that they were plugged in to the charging station,5
3383,this unit is much smaller than i thought it would be and i would recommend it to a friend,5
3384,i managed to fit two credit cards an i d and two 20's in the provided slots,5
3385,the case is very sturdy and protects the phone very well for the cost of the case,5
3386,so inexpensive and nice that i think i'll pick up a couple more just in case,5
3387,this is one of those devices that you need if you do not like the ear-plug types that go in your ear,5
3388,the phone actually looks like does not have a case on it doesn't scratch your phone,5
3389,it arrived quickly and i've had no issues with this adapter at all,5
3390,it looked exactly like it did online when i got it and it was fully charged when was a plus,5
3391,three usb outputs that provide for charging up to three devices at once depending on what they are,5
3392,i like the case very much it fits my phone perfectly and even though its sparkly its not too much,5
3393,i have been using an android phone for a year and a half and it hasn't come off by itself,5
3394,i can't even count the number of times i've wanted that in a dark hotel room,5
3395,there is a voice call function but it doesn't seem to bother my phone either way,5
3396,i have samsung note2 and it works very well with my iphone and now my iphone is safe,5
3397,one of the other benefits i love about this headset is that its firmware is upgradeable,5
3398,let me start by saying that i work for a company that requires me to travel and be outside a lot,5
3399,i have used many products in the past and this is the first screen protector i have ever installed,5
3400,it fits snugly but yet is not hard to remove when i want to quickly change the case to another one,5
3401,the big gain here is that you don't have to use this only in your car,5
3402,it's not the most substantial feeling product but as long as it works i will live with a rather short cord,5
3403,this charger is probably the best charger i've ever had for all devices,5
3404,stick all these icons on one row so i don't have to worry about dropping my phone any more,5
3405,1 amps port for you to charge your devices at the same time or even two devices at the same time,5
3406,i was so impressed with it on my galaxy s3 i decided to buy different color cases with flowers on them,5
3407,i'm very clumsy and drop my phone a lot and this has protected it,5
3408,we are happy with the purchase and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good screen protector,5
3409,installation once again i was very pleased with the ease of installation and the incredible durability makes the price well worth it,5
3410,this headset is so clear that i can't tell if he's using it or not when he calls,5
3411,1a which allows you to charge both an ipad and iphone at the same time using the usb cable supplied with the battery case,5
3412,when even the apple charger seemed to not work i bought several of these to have extra ones around the house,5
3413,but this is lacking an led light to let you know that it isstill charging which isn't a huge deal,5
3414,the ports light up red when the charger is plugged in letting you know it is functioning properly,5
3415,i thought mine was broke but after a little research i found this and it works perfect,5
3416,again the polycarbonate shell is slippery for me as i don't have to deal with a cord,5
3417,it fits my phone so well and the color is exactly as the picture shows on my white phone,5
3418,this was a christmas gift for my daughter-in-law who loves hello kitty items,5
3419,with this battery pack i can charge my phone from the unit as well,5
3420,on the other hand if you don't need to use the cd player to mount this,5
3421,it's easy to apply and from what i've seen in other reviews at least for me,5
3422,i've gone through a lot of cases for the epic 4 g touch and it's a tight fit with even one card,5
3423,all i will say is that it fits my phone better than the stock cradle easier to put in also,5
3424,i can also see myself using this at the gym to listen to music or watch shows on a portable device,5
3425,figure out your method and make sure you don't bust the ribbon cables,5
3426,i got this in the mail today and it came early which is good and i would recommend this case,5
3427,i dropped my phone a few times and haven't had any issues since putting the battery into my phone,5
3428,i have used the charger to charge my motorola photon and was pleasantly surprised at how small this external backup battery is,5
3429,i like it for the holidays as it has a little 34 bling 34 to their phone while protecting it without spending too much,5
3430,i paid the lg with my iphone in the car and also connect it to my macbook,5
3431,the screen is incredible the speakers are loud and clear for a cell phone and the bottom is for tablets,5
3432,both ports can be used simultaneously to charge an iphone 4s and first generation ipad and was really satisfied with the experience,5
3433,i could also play a cd at the same time just do the best you can at this point,5
3434,now there's a clever way around that problem with the victsing bluetooth audio receiver adapter,5
3435,this is a perfect fit for my phone and very cute,5
3436,my mom loved the gift this is one of the best cases that ive ever reviewed or owned,5
3437,this product works well and i would recommend it to anyone that can afford it,5
3438,let me start by saying i have applied a lot of screen protectors and this is the best one i have found,5
3439,at a great price and very easy to apply to the phone all without any liquid,5
3440,the only concern is that if you have a screen protector it will not break,5
3441,the protectors are clear and you can't even tell i have the protector it's seamless,5
3442,it just came in today so i can't attest to its ability to protect the phone in the event of a drop,5
3443,versatility you can charge anything that uses a usb cable to charge the phone while it's in use,5
3444,adds quite a bit of weight to the phone and doesn't add on the extra bulk,5
3445,i've dropped it twice now in 2 weeks and haven't had any problems with my phone getting loose or thrown off,5
3446,figured the samsung s4 should have a protector due to the size of the connector some phone cases may not fit,5
3447,it stands out and most importantly covers and protects my phone as it should dropped my phone 5x and this protected it everytime,5
3448,this 4 34 n 34 one pen is great i do not need to carry additional chargers with me when i travel,5
3449,with that being said let me admit that i like to change things up every so often i am thrilled,5
3450,it covers the entire face of the screen all the way to the four edges with no overhang if applied correctly,5
3451,i can not comment on the quality of the screen protector has been great thus far,5
3452,again it does lack the curves of the iphone but it's not high enough to bother me,5
3453,not sure why this happened but i didn't have any bubbles form when i put it on,5
3454,this case is great protection and extends the battery life of the phone but made it very bulky,5
3455,i totally lovvvvveeeeeeeeeeeee iittttttt very helpful i dont have to worry about knocking my phone off my desk,5
3456,i have dropped this phone many times and it has never suffered any damage,5
3457,it has nice grip with a rubberized feel so it won't slip out of my hand even after a hard sweaty work out,5
3458,i was so impressed with the sturdiness i popped it out of the box and was so easy to set up and use,5
3459,i have used this for a few months now and it's as good if not better than the finger,5
3460,i upgraded to an iphone a few months ago and i still use it every time i work out,5
3461,i've had this case for my samsung galaxy note to take video underwater,5
3462,words of cautionpull both sides of the cord out at the same time otherwise the cord will hang up inside the casing,5
3463,i set up my ipad and a youtube video on how to put it on and you'll do great,5
3464,0a allows the ability to charge two phones at the same time one phone and the gps,5
3465,i may start setting it down on the screen side to avoid potential heartache,5
3466,so i bought this case and it has great protection better than the otterbox,5
3467,then i peel one side of the screen protector and apply to your phone,5
3468,i had used rearth cases in the past and the quality of this one is very good and it's charging quickly,5
3469,i use the techarmor privacy screen protector and it didn't lift up when putting the case on,5
3470,i got this phone case in the mail today and it is so pretty,5
3471,however buttons are easy to press i don't know why this happened but thought i'd mention it,5
3472,so far its a good phone and only time will tell if it really is much of a bargain,5
3473,i can also charge my iphone at the same time and it works quite fast 2,5
3474,also works well in my car so i don't have to worry about running out of battery or missing another call,5
3475,i ordered a few cases and this one is still holding up strong and we use it very often,5
3476,the smooth surface of this charger means that you will have to sync via wifi cloud or take your phone out of the charger,5
3477,and btw the flip coverallows you to adjust the angle of the case when you want to,5
3478,haven't dropped my phone yet but it seems like it would take the brunt of the force,5
3479,so far i'm very pleased with this cord and would recommend it to anyone looking for this particular item,5
3480,i was able to charge two iphones at the same time but i haven't had any bad experience with this charger,5
3481,i really like the fact that i can change out the colors when i get bored with them,5
3482,if you are thinking about getting this i would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of case,5
3483,it's a great phone but the battery life is worth it,5
3484,in the end i definitely recommend this case to anyone with an iphone 5,5
3485,these items can save you hundreds and not to mention the time it took for me to get this was good,5
3486,i bought this once before and i liked it but i wouldnt buy it again,5
3487,i like how the case slightly covers the front edges of the phone which prevent it from being scratched when it falls,5
3488,the feature that really sold me on this device is that it has a physical on-off switch and compact size,5
3489,i've only been using it for a few months and it seems to be holding up well,5
3490,i definitely recommend this to people who don't like to carry a purse so this was perfect for her,5
3491,so i read the reviews on this one and i was impressed with the shock absorption,5
3492,the qi receiver adds a bit of bulk to your phone but i rather that then charge it constantly,5
3493,i love the feature where i can listen to my music and never have to worry that i misplaced it,5
3494,so far i find the phone to be easy to use like any other droid device,5
3495,some cases are slipperly and without the case the phone is very smooth and even slippery at times,5
3496,it might not sound like that much but it's more than enough to keep the phone safe,5
3497,a must-have for anyone who does not have a screen protector like the otterbox defender,5
3498,i have gotten phone cases for my iphone 4s that didn't seem to fit which talkie tech did replace without hassle,5
3499,it has a cutout in the front so you can place your phone face down and it will not get scratched,5
3500,the outer hard case covers the outside of the phone and gives it a nice feel not too thick and not too thin,5
3501,i avoided this design because of the hole in the back to show the apple symbol and i love them all,5
3502,i put it in my back pocket and the case has protected it well both from cosmetic and structural damage,5
3503,it charges my galaxy note very fast and the charge lasts for a long time and sound quality is amazingly good,5
3504,that being said i liked this product very much good material if you like to protect your phone in style,5
3505,it is a good price and i don't have to think about any of it,5
3506,it's not the cheapest cord but i think you get what you pay for when it comes to a phone case,5
3507,i like that it doesn't look like i have the screen protector on the phone screen and feel like it not there,5
3508,final verdict overall this phone is the best phone money can buy you,5
3509,its the mosy durable case i have ever owned and that is saying something,5
3510,the wall charger ac 100-240v 50-60hz enabling worldwide electrical compatibility,5
3511,all in all i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a basic jogging armband,5
3512,easier to see who's calling without having to pick up the phone and turn it on,5
3513,however i do have a kindle fire and have been able to easily make my phone last a day,5
3514,i not only use my phone but i take a lot of road trips so i will try it soon,5
3515,this is the third non-apple lightning cable i have used and it isn't that expensive for what it does,5
3516,it fits perfectly it's easy to pull on and off and you can't beat the price,5
3517,maxboost pro premium composite bought this one for my son-in-laws phone,5
3518,i do have to mention the case does not protect the front and back of the case together broke,5
3519,i have experienced slight discomfort after a couple of hours of setting it up and playing with it,5
3520,other than that the case is perfect and i would recommend it to other evo 4 g users,5
3521,the buttons have a slightly clear texture so you can see the original 34 beauty 34 of the s5 phone itself,5
3522,now the only thing about the holster case is that it does not come with a rear-screen protector,5
3523,i have been using this charger for over a month and i am very pleased with it and it has become my go to charger,5
3524,the charger has a soft blue light that comes to let you know it is charging and the device is created to not overheat,5
3525,i have used this now for about a month and no peeling had occurred,5
3526,yes and we drop the phone every once in a while in the music which i never had with my nokia 6300b,5
3527,even as just as case it looks good and doesn't make my phone bulky or slippy,5
3528,really cool to have and it takes about four hours to charge it all the way from empty,5
3529,i love this cable it has handled every compatible device i've thrown at it from iphones to ipads and even android phones,5
3530,this is by far the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost,5
3531,i love the fact that i can just grab my phone and be done with it,5
3532,i love this screen protector i have dropped my phone on concrete and it saved my case,5
3533,the screen has a built in screen protector and comes with a good reputation,5
3534,also very easy to pop your phone in and out of it a few times,5
3535,my only minor complaint is how the rubberized portion of the case created enough friction that it wouldn't slide out,5
3536,she really like that the case isn't bulky and it looks great too,5
3537,a qualified 3 stars because it does what it's supposed to do and does it well,5
3538,i have been using it for a few months now and it's been great,5
3539,i would recommend to anyone looking for a case for their gs3,5
3540,whats really nice about this device is that it fits in your pocket,5
3541,these came sooner than promised and i wanted to make sure that i was satisfied with my purchase,5
3542,the case is very slim which is the main reason why i stayed with verizon instead of hopping to sprint,5
3543,really like it also liked the price and i would recommend this case over the otter box any day of the week,5
3544,i've own this uag case for almost a year now and i haven't touched it once,5
3545,i got this for my wife she was very impressed with the detail and how well it fit her phone,5
3546,the audio quality is excellent both for you and the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it,5
3547,i've been using this for a few months now and have had no problems,5
3548,i like this case because it keeps my phone well protected and i also like the screen protector on this one,5
3549,its alot better than having the phone in my pocket by itself except protected,5
3550,i also like the texture of the case as well as the flash for the camera flashlight,5
3551,the shipping is fast and when i received the case it was on time for delivery to me,5
3552,this one adds only 1 4 oz to my iphone 5s and provides a full charge in about 2 hours,5
3553,wish it had a screen protector that came with it was a great bonus,5
3554,for my note 3 it fits well not too tight not too loose where the phone moves around,5
3555,the silent button is very easy to access and is on the bottom edge of the right side headband leg,5
3556,the two usb ports allow you to charge two items at the same time,5
3557,trust me i have gone through a lot of cases for the epic 4 g touch and the case looks really good on the phone,5
3558,fits the phone perfectly very easy to put on and does not slide around wherever i put it,5
3559,besides the color being darker on the printing i can't tell the difference between my oem's and the new extra buds,5
3560,i use all three chargers one at home one in the car and one in my briefcase,5
3561,i previously had the spg but this is just as good at a fraction of the price,5
3562,as long as your batteries contact fit you will be able to charge nearly 90 % of the devices out there today,5
3563,i use this primarily for audio books and i am very happy with the durability and protection the otterbox gives,5
3564,i have seen some negative reviews and i don't understand why they would think it was okay to do this,5
3565,easy to put my phone in and never have to worry about my battery running low any more,5
3566,this one is better quality comes with a screen protector and when i put it on the charger every night,5
3567,if the phone screen does not automatically turn off when the battery reaches 100 %,5
3568,surprisingly the v2 case works perfectly with my phone and leaves just enough room around the edge for my case,5
3569,it feels sturdy in the hand and doesn't slip or fall off with use,5
3570,it has a great feel and allows access to all ports and will protect from minor mishaps,5
3571,i bought this bumper because i didn't want to have to do all that,5
3572,i've installed screen protectors on many different phones and tablets and have never had a negative experience even on my first install,5
3573,if you want to protect your bionic without adding too much bulk to the slim profile of the iphone 5,5
3574,i have to adjust it in such a way that it doesn't cover any of the phone's holes cutouts are perfectly placed,5
3575,if you're looking for a simple case that will protect your phone without making it look like crap,5
3576,dual ports allow flexibility to charge a variety of mobile devices when you can't get to a charger for a couple days,5
3577,the case is a breeze to put on and you have nothing to worry about so go ahead and buy,5
3578,i would really recommend this product to anyone who want's protection without a high cost,5
3579,i've tried 6 bluetooth headsets and this is the best i've ever used,5
3580,good quality and the dual port is very convenient to charge both iphone and android phone at one time,5
3581,although this functions as a bluetooth speaker phone i got it as a gift for my best friend and she loves it,5
3582,it has kept my phone protected so far from a few 3-4 falls as well which was great,5
3583,very slim and stylish does not add bulkiness to the phone which makes it feels more hefty in a good way,5
3584,i have several 30 and this one is easily my favorite thanks to oxa for the review unit,5
3585,i bought him a small leather portfollio case to protect it from the typical bumps and bangs his phone generally endures,5
3586,it just means you won't have to worry about it anymore,5
3587,very pleased with these and would recommend them to anyone looking for great sound and small form factor,5
3588,the design is nearly flawless and i love the fact that it doesn't add a lot of bulk yet protects the phone,5
3589,that means i can leave my iphone in it's case and a few extra cards as well,5
3590,it's really nice to be able to charge my phone and ipod at the same time and quite quickly,5
3591,these styluses just blew me away the micro-knit tip does not get damage from your bag,5
3592,i trust this case and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something short of a smartphone,5
3593,i tell all my friends to buy skinomi and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a new battery,5
3594,these are not as flimsy as the ones they sell in the mall for many times more,5
3595,i also purchased one for my galaxy note 2 and i will continue buying iphones also,5
3596,i've had it for months now and it hasn't let me down yet,5
3597,finally a blue led light lets you know when it's charging and if it needs charging,5
3598,decided to make use of my sprint unlimited plan on a recent road trip and it was very easy to apply,5
3599,although i paid more to purchase this phone new i am very glad that i made the decision to get the red,5
3600,paired up to her iphone quickly and the sound and call quality is great being sweat proof is just a bonus,5
3601,the feel is good and it easily slides in and out of the pocket does stick like other gell case or defender case,5
3602,this cell is for my douther and she is very happy with the fact that the colors matched the pictures shown,5
3603,as a woman i don't always like to have my phone with no case,5
3604,otterbox continually keeps making some great products and i have never had a portable speaker work so well,5
3605,it did not add much bulk to the phone the power button and volume rockers are actually easier to operate you can feel em,5
3606,i have been using it for about a week now and the battery last for a full day,5
3607,i love this case it looks exactly like the picture the color is still pretty,5
3608,since it has a handle on it i don't have to worry about that jostling around or getting caught,5
3609,very cute case the color is great and the case seems to be holding up very well,5
3610,i would extremely recommend to anyone looking for a good case that would protect it,5
3611,when this case was on i forgot i had a case on the phone it worked perfectly with her galaxy s3,5
3612,all told even if i paid twice the price i would buy this again when i notice a significant change,5
3613,very snug takes a little effort to get the phone into the pack and it truly does double the battery life,5
3614,the case was shipped fast and was easy to put on,5
3615,the case fits the iphone 5c perfectly and includes a built-in 3 full range forward firing speaker,5
3616,for a product with such a simple use i was really impressed with the quality especially because i got them so cheap,5
3617,this is a fantastic size to stick in my purse in the car basically i can have one anywhere,5
3618,i use it for my iphone 4s and kindle fire at the same time fast with easy,5
3619,this product is great for having an all-in-one charger and cord not two separate pieces,5
3620,all in all i am very pleased with it it looks exactly how it does in the picture and it really protects your phone,5
3621,this is why i purchased this packet of screen protectors for the iphone 4 and this is easily the best available,5
3622,the in-your-ear design makes it a lot easier to plug your phone into the charger in the dark,5
3623,having it charge right now will tell you how long it takes to charge the spare battery in the car or the road,5
3624,but the design it takes some time to get used to it but it works great,5
3625,took a month to get to me other than that it is a very sturdy nice cover,5
3626,first time using a glass screen protector and i will never buy any other brand,5
3627,i wouldn't take my phone out of the case to fit it in my elevation dock for charging and syncing,5
3628,i have had this charger for over a year and it still works like the day i got it,5
3629,the plantronics are comfortable to wear and i have found them to be just as good as anything i've seen with htc or motorola,5
3630,i have more than one of these and they both work fine with several different phone batteries,5
3631,has extended lip over the edges so it protects the phone in a fall,5
3632,he drops his phone every once in a while and it will stay in place,5
3633,you can't charge a battery and a phone at the same time the kids charge their 47 random things,5
3634,it took a few weeks to arrive but it's very inexpensive and the quality of the case is great,5
3635,i had a slight problem with my first shipment and they were so nice and mailed me a black one at no cost,5
3636,my only gripe is that the buttons on the side are covered by the case and still completely functional,5
3637,after researching plenty of other options i decided to go with the wallet case and give it a try,5
3638,i love this case and holster i have had this case now for a good few weeks and love it,5
3639,it feels good holding it and it doesn't bulk up the phone and it totally protects it,5
3640,the charger did a great job charging my ipad and iphone on my way to and from work,5
3641,i also own five other cases for my note 3 and this is the best one,5
3642,my phone feels very protected and the case is very sturdy will protect my precious new phone,5
3643,it definitely is a protector as i've dropped my phone a few times and no scratches,5
3644,shell fits perfect to the phone and has a good feel in hand,5
3645,good buy for a good price it looks good on a white or black body and gets the job done,5
3646,i have quite a few of these external battery packs and this is the smallest one in size,5
3647,it is easy to install and is very high quality as well and has a great semi-rubbery feel,5
3648,and now that i had the time to test the battery i will report back after 1 month of using this,5
3649,when we get our new car i'll be buying another one the same exact one lol,5
3650,i gave it as a gift and they didn't even know what it was suppose to be,5
3651,this is an awesome buy and i would recommend it if you're thinking about getting this car charger do it,5
3652,the hinged kick-stand is wonderful and i use it all of the time with my iphone 4s with a bumper case,5
3653,i purchased this case as a replacement for another case so i would not have to take off my phone's minimalist gel cover,5
3654,i can just slide my phone in and out of my pocket easily and it protects the phone,5
3655,this speck candy shell case is pretty nice to hold and doesn't feel cheap like other cases,5
3656,came quickly are easy to put on and don't add any bulk to the iphone 4's gorgeous frame,5
3657,i call them cyborgs and i can't tell if they are on speaker or if i'm holding it,5
3658,crystal clear non-rubberized material and really thin and you can barely tell that you have anything on your phone screen,5
3659,its sort of hard rubber so its great if you drop your phone it saves the screen like you wouldn't believe,5
3660,awesome product and does exactly what i need it to do and it doesnt take long,5
3661,works as described and has allowed me to use my sim card from my iphone and change it to another one,5
3662,it makes a solid first impression when taken out of the package but it's a nice case,5
3663,overall i love this case but i don't put it on my phone yet and the price that i paid was worse it,5
3664,made strong ive had it for over a week now and it has no scratches,5
3665,all and all i am happy with this case and i love how it makes the phone look,5
3666,just put your phone in the holder you can still plug it into the usb port and then press the power button to start charging,5
3667,it's not better than the battery that came with the phone at a very good price,5
3668,i was supplied a sample of the product for test and evaluation and i promised that my review is fair and honest,5
3669,it works well and the color is just what i wanted and searched high and low love the materials thank you,5
3670,the charger charges devices just as fast as my home charger and was able to fully charge both of these devices,5
3671,the description had me wondering if it came with a cable or a somewhat built it cable,5
3672,it is easily the best case i've had so far,5
3673,i primarily purchase the headset phones for listening to music at work and lasts the entire time,5
3674,i bought this so that i can use my phone charger and this adapter,5
3675,order was received promptly and to my surprise it's a very high quality headset and i'm very satisfied overall with it,5
3676,one other issue for me is that i have to take it out to pause and start youtube videos,5
3677,when the case is on there's a small opening at the top for putting this on a key ring,5
3678,they are well worth the price now i don't need to buy the cheaply-made plantronics case,5
3679,i used 4 other chargers non of them even come close to the wonder that is the arkon ipm515,5
3680,but since the spare battery holds its charge for a long time so that too is a plus,5
3681,i'd also assume that lateral impact would be absorbed by the case if it was ever to be dropped,5
3682,wont charge battery and cellphone at the same time i think it deserves its five stars,5
3683,very easy to put my phone in remove my phone from the holder without bending my wrist into an awkward shape,5
3684,overall it gives my iphone more juice to get me through the day or no access to charger times,5
3685,why pay more when you don't need it you're kidding yourself,5
3686,bad thing is my wife took it and i may have to buy another because my wife wants this one for her car,5
3687,this should prevent that from happening and should extend the life of the battery so that's fine with me,5
3688,i typically use 2 or 3 just trying to get them on without bubbles or something caught underneath the protector,5
3689,it feels very soft and it slides in and out of the pocket don't even notice it's on,5
3690,it fits the home button perfectly and it makes it easier to hold on to the phone not slippery at all,5
3691,all i can say great headset can't even tell it's there until you use it,5
3692,it is not however strong enough to hold when you pick up the phone and does not leave a sticky residue on surfaces,5
3693,great color but i didn't see that in the instructions,5
3694,8 screened samsung galaxys iii for a few weeks now and i am still in love,5
3695,i could also put the plate between the soft part of the case is a magnet for hair and dust,5
3696,it doesn't add a lot of weight to your phone,5
3697,it is small fantastic for travel feels like a quality product and i have had zero issues with it,5
3698,bottom line this is a great screen protector at a great price try spigen sgp,5
3699,the case fits the phone perfectly and allows you to see the screen while charging which is nice,5
3700,works as the original that came with my phone and for that price you can't go wrong,5
3701,the jewels have stayed on amid the case fits my phone perfectly with no flaws i have a droid razr maxx,5
3702,maybe because it's new and i used it right out of the box and used it right away for my nexus 5,5
3703,but i had the case for about a year now and i must say i continue to love this phone,5
3704,i would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a screen protector for my new iphone 5s,5
3705,no charging cables are included so you'll need to provide your own cables either the ones that came with your phone,5
3706,if you want a case and don't want to have a bulge in your pocket,5
3707,all in all i would definitely recommend this case to anyone with an iphone 5 that doesn't use a holster,5
3708,the phone's back snapped on easily and i didn't even notice any scratches from the drop on the case itself,5
3709,i'm definitely ordering a few more of these in the near future,5
3710,overall these are awesome and it's nice not to have to be able to charge anywhere,5
3711,a woman does not mind carrying this and it provides a good protection and its slimmer at the same time,5
3712,although i'm not going to go carrying it around when i'm out of the way in a neat and small package,5
3713,mine has a regular home in my living room where i leave it connected to a external battery unit to charge spent batteries,5
3714,my only minor complaint is how the rubberized portion of the case created enough friction that it wouldn't slide out,5
3715,now i have a case to protect it and i love that it has different tips to accommodate anything,5
3716,i have lots of cases for my iphone and this one is far and away my favorite,5
3717,but it protects amazingly my phone and when i take it out to clean it it's always in pristine condition,5
3718,price is good and saved trying to get my wife to switch over but she won't yet,5
3719,received it on time and i am really happy with what i have,5
3720,quality this product is very well made and is holding up great,5
3721,in reality i turned it on and it charged to 100 % in about 2 hours,5
3722,a sample of this product was sent to me so that i could use it as a headset for my dumbphone,5
3723,the sleep button and the volume buttons are on the left top power on the right top,5
3724,i love the little pouch it comes with so i don't have to take my iphone5 out of the case to charge it,5
3725,i thought the whole case was tpu but the back is a hard clear plastic with can be easily scratch,5
3726,we both love this case and i highly recommend it for all touch screen devices,5
3727,such a small device still produces over two and a half hours of playtime at fairly high volumes,5
3728,i didn't have any overheating problems when using both ports at the same time and it charges both at the same time flawlessly,5
3729,i don't have any apple products so i can't speak to how it works in that respect,5
3730,it holds it firm and it's easy to pull the phone out of your pocket when you need it,5
3731,this is a nice fitting case that doesn't get in the way of my gear shift,5
3732,these are my my favorite i use it all the time and i'm never without a good battery,5
3733,with all the latest technology you can't have too many of these usb cables for your phone,5
3734,no charge indicators so you wouldn 8217 t know how much charge you have until it 8217s finished,5
3735,it charges easily using the usb to micro usb cable provided and the charge lasts quite awhile,5
3736,overall i gave the unit 5 stars for ease of use the ability to stream music from phone but other features blew me away,5
3737,at 2600 mah it has the capacity to completely recharge most cellphones 4-5 times,5
3738,i bought some for myself and i'm going to buy another one just so i can have two,5
3739,i have had it for a couple of weeks now and i am very happy with it and it feels well built and sturdy,5
3740,this red one is the third elago case i have ordered for my cell but this is by far the best,5
3741,no one can tell if i am in my car or someone else's,5
3742,i've had these things for a few months now and it's as good as i remember with the android phone,5
3743,bluetooth can be a bit flaky the thing i like about this one is the overall design it looks nice,5
3744,only thing i hate about this battery is that i can't use just any screen protector with the case,5
3745,sometimes these break easily but for the price you pay it's a steal,5
3746,i have used it every night and i dont have any issues charging the phone or using the headphone jack,5
3747,my vivid fits in the cradle perfectly and it allows me to use it both phones at the same time,5
3748,the case offers decent protection too i dropped my phone the other day in the parking lot of the ymca,5
3749,the day i received the screen protectors i also received an email from the company about the anker,5
3750,i think this is one of the best bluetooth headets i've ever used and i've tried plantronics motorola 305's and sony,5
3751,voices come in crisp and clear and i haven't had any problems with it and it works like a charm,5
3752,i wish magpul made a case for my note 3 it was on sale for under 50,5
3753,while a very simple case it provides enough protection to the phone without adding a lot of bulk,5
3754,you should choose another style charging cable if you need to have a long lightning cable this is the one,5
3755,i'm biased towards bose and yet i was impressed with how well it charged my iphone and kindle fire hd 8,5
3756,i've had this case for about three weeks and i love this thing,5
3757,i recommend this phone case as long as your a person who is on the go and doesn't want to carry a purse,5
3758,in fact i am now able to charge 3 devices at the same time,5
3759,first of all this case is not thin and most of the time i use my phone for an extended period of time without discomfort,5
3760,i've used it for my iphone 5 and it came with a screen protecter and a stylus which both came in handy,5
3761,turned out great for him and it actually works as long as you have the cable that came with your device,5
3762,i've had one on my iphone for about a week and it seems to be very solid and well made,5
3763,it arrived today and i couldn't be more happy with it,5
3764,it is snug and even dropped my phone a few times and was happy to see the skip play and pause buttons all worked perfectly,5
3765,didn't fit quite right but it gets the job done and has yet to hiccup,5
3766,i bought two of these and it has given new life to my creative player making it bluetooth capable,5
3767,downside is that it only comes with one so take your time putting it on correctly and you're good to go,5
3768,however that drawback is the price you pay for having more battery life,5
3769,i have not used these for phone calls so i can not comment on using the unit to make calls,5
3770,it also fits tight enough that if you do drop your phone the screen won't get scratched,5
3771,i will definitely be buying more of these for my mother for her ipad,5
3772,it works fine and the best part is that its only a few dollars,5
3773,this is my third after galaxy nexus and nexus 4 and i would recommend for the protection it gives and design,5
3774,after several months of use i am very happy with it,5
3775,i purchased the multi-pack because my wife also has a samsung focus and she has the same timeout issues,5
3776,it fits great in my purse and i don't have to remove the case to plug in the charger,5
3777,it does take away some of the beauty of the phone as the back becomes clear and 100 % transparent,5
3778,i am using this cable with my samsung epic 4 g without any problems at all,5
3779,so bottom line is that i do like the product and have continued to use it,5
3780,this comes nicely packaged and has quality written all over it therefore i think the price is fair,5
3781,the iphone is very slick and i have almost dropped it a few times a surprise since spigen's cases are generally awesome,5
3782,i ordered these back in april when i got my phone and i couldn't find one within 50 miles,5
3783,transfer and charging rates are equal to oem for a fraction of the price of others and easy to install,5
3784,i'm a painter and i was looking for something similar but cheaper than an otterbox,5
3785,-the case adds a bit of bulk to the phone but it does insure protection from drops etc,5
3786,the stock battery is thinner therefore it can still be used with a case on the phone,5
3787,also it looks great on my phone it is also very easy to take out when the phone rings,5
3788,i had a hard time finding a tripod mount for my samsung galaxy note 2 does a good job in protecting my new phone,5
3789,my favorite part is that it doesn't pull my hair like the otter box does,5
3790,i guess the only issue would be that it takes longer to charge this battery than others i've used,5
3791,i purchased two of these one for myself and one for my father-in law,5
3792,fits the phone perfectly samsung galaxy s4 and seems to charge faster than most products in its product line,5
3793,you would never know it as this case really does protect the phone and the fit is flawless,5
3794,this product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative,5
3795,it's not because of the protector itself it's exactly what you'd expect from the pictures,5
3796,ive looked at a lot of cases and this one feels like it is made better and will hold up better,5
3797,this phone is awesome and for the price it's worth getting them in a few colors,5
3798,the top row of keys are too close to the bottom of the screen and spun around which indicated it was thinking,5
3799,it is a fantastic phone and i am glad i bought it but my favorite is still the red one,5
3800,works great in the car for my skyrocket would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra juice to keep their devices charged,5
3801,great value and i can not wait to use it to its fullest,5
3802,next the speaker makes a really loud chime when you turn it on and when you try to pair devices,5
3803,i really love this case so i recommend this to anyone who wants a thin case that offers some protection for their phone,5
3804,this is a quality product and i am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone,5
3805,this ismooth cable is great and i look forward to seeing how it'll hold up over time,5
3806,i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a stylus that is both versatile and stylish,5
3807,this case is awesome it fits the phone snug and accurately,5
3808,i like the design and the material doesn't seem like it will take much force to break this,5
3809,not only can it charge tow devices at the same time but the maximum overall output will be limited to 2,5
3810,-dual port allows user to charge two phones at the same time and it charges both at the same time flawlessly,5
3811,i think its much better in person than in the photograph of the product,5
3812,i've had my galaxy s3 for a few months now and have not regreted it at all,5
3813,i love this is is really great to be able to finally have a phone with amazing speakers,5
3814,my galaxy s3 fits in it even with a tpu case on my phone to protect against accidental drops and add more grip,5
3815,this dual purpose stylus works great you can use it as a stand-alone speakerphone conference phone,5
3816,it would have been nice if it came with a built in screen protector is a great product and surprisingly light weight,5
3817,this is the next closest thing and i haven't had any issues with it coming off when i didn't want it to,5
3818,thanks why i order it and it came pretty fast about 3 days later,5
3819,i chose the all black one to be on the safe side in case i lost or broke my other one,5
3820,mind you i am abusive and if it wasnt for this case my phone would have surely broke,5
3821,you can use these several hours a day for several days and still haven't had to charge them since the initial charge,5
3822,overall it works great and is easy to switch between them,5
3823,it almost doubles the thickness of the phone so it's not even any extra cost right now,5
3824,fits great and is so slim i can barely tell it's on since it's the same color pattern,5
3825,i actually like this phone case just wish it had a kick stand for watching tv or whatever but overall great product,5
3826,if you dim the screen it's very hard to see what's on each key,5
3827,also background noise canceling is great i work in the oilfield and this product makes a perfect fit for my iphone 5,5
3828,the case has tightened up a little after having it on for a while it is a task to get off,5
3829,you can safely put it face-down on a table desk etc as the bezel elevates,5
3830,fits my phone perfectly and is easy to take on and off and it hasn't broken,5
3831,i just received my repair kit and i am very please with the quality of my order,5
3832,when i call her i no longer have to wait to use my phone,5
3833,the inbuilt voice tells you when it is turned on or off how much battery is left5,5
3834,trust me i've looked all over for one that fits my phone and i couldn't be happier,5
3835,also love that you can see the apple logo and the writing on the back of the phone is uncovered,5
3836,it has a softer rubbery feel not too hard not too soft with a quiet click when you press it,5
3837,i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good car usb charger for their devices,5
3838,we have had for a long time now and still looks brand new after it has been dropped a few times,5
3839,it outputs 720p in my phone not sure if it's a new process or material but i love it,5
3840,1 galaxy note 2 at the same time and it was ugly,5
3841,it a simple piece of silicone but it's easy to put on and comes in different colors,5
3842,the headset itself sounds excellent and i couldn't believe the price of the same charger,5
3843,i've had this case for 5 months now and it is still as good as it was when i bought it,5
3844,i charged it up really easily and it's so small i can easily fit it in any pocket,5
3845,i was initially skeptical about this product because it was so cheap but when it arrived i was surprised by quality softness of the case,5
3846,i have had this for a few weeks now and waited to review it,5
3847,the case is also bumped up a bit around the front so you can place your phone face down on a flat surface,5
3848,fortunately these devices are all pretty similar so you can figure out how to use this while walking from place to place,5
3849,i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a simple and slim case that fits like a glove,5
3850,resetting the phone on the pad and it starts charging right up,5
3851,i have a number of these power packs and this one is one of the better parts i've used,5
3852,i thought it worked fairly well but after a few months it still works as expected great buy,5
3853,i received a complementary item in exchange for an honest review which you have just read,5
3854,her phone lasts all day so i don't want to comment any further,5
3855,not saying it will save your phone if you drop it and it doesnt protect the screen,5
3856,if you are a normal minute's user you probably won't even notice it's there while talking on your iphone,5
3857,i really love this case i think this is one of the best chargers for all of my phones since then,5
3858,this cord works as well as the oem no complaints would recommend it for those who need and oversized phone holster,5
3859,unfortunately my daughter did not notice it was for an iphone 5 but it was for a 4 4s,5
3860,for the price i don't think there is a better way to make a case i don't know what is,5
3861,my research came up with few stand and for the price of this one that's what i was expecting,5
3862,it completely charges my kindle fire in about 4 hours and my extended battery in about 6,5
3863,my only issue is that the open corner has a small crack in it at the top of the case holds the phone in securely,5
3864,the covers for the volume buttons and power button are easy to use with the case on,5
3865,i have used many screen protectors in the past and have had problems with the case actually matching the camera lens,5
3866,i've dropped my phone a few times and this case takes the impact every time,5
3867,press the button on the bottom of the phone while it is in the multimedia station,5
3868,the case it cute and i've had it for over a year now and this case has kept it 100 % protected,5
3869,i think i might get another for the other charging port in my truck free for a third rider to use,5
3870,kim rose sold this white cord to me and i didn't have any issues putting this case on it,5
3871,the tylt tunz is without a doubt the best headset i have ever owned,5
3872,this works well to make sure at the end of the day this battery provides a little extra battery life,5
3873,i love this charger and recommend it to anyone looking for a functional attractive galaxy s3 case,5
3874,but overall very functional and you can put your phone in your pocket with change or keys dumb idea anyway,5
3875,i find it to be just as good as the more expensive apple one,5
3876,i charged my iphone 5s and ipad in a short period of time is to shorten the life of the item itself,5
3877,the case wraps around the side of the unit's case,5
3878,she absolutely loves the color and added protection that his case gives me and the black color keeps it looking sleek,5
3879,the design is nearly flawless and i love the fact that when you put the phone screen down in theory it shouldn't scratch either,5
3880,i like it so much i'm buying a second one just to keep in the car and the office,5
3881,the near complete encasement of the phone is the most important factor in my decision to keep or exchange the droid x,5
3882,they fit securely on the case however i was a little concerned it would be hard to get the note 2 out,5
3883,i'm surprised by the negative reviews that it doesn't protect the front of the phone he likes the color too,5
3884,totally loved by my son and i don't have to remove my case in order to use the phone,5
3885,with this just make sure the screen is very clean before applying it,5
3886,it's lite comfortable sound is good and no one that i've called has said that i sound any different,5
3887,yes it works good for ipads i love the colors and i have been approached by everyone,5
3888,if the juice box is fully discharged it takes about 7-8 hours to charge as stated in the specifications,5
3889,it is definitely loud enough and i even use it to listen to music on long runs bike rides while doing the dishes,5
3890,if you're looking for extra batteries and don't want to spend 40-50 on a charger,5
3891,this screen protector was easy to apply and had no big trouble,5
3892,it covers the volume buttons on the side but that is okay,5
3893,my only minor complaint is that the power button and the volume buttons so they are easy to press,5
3894,you can have two tablets or a tablet and a phone can be charged at the same time,5
3895,the fit is great and all the holes line up and it is very comfortable,5
3896,overall this is an effective productpros 1 lighting cable works just like the original one that comes with my samsung galaxy 4 g,5
3897,also if you have two tablets they can both be charged at the same time via a micro usb cable included,5
3898,as has been mentioned by others they do not cover the whole screen but that is noted before you purchase,5
3899,you focus with a dial located on the upper left corner of the inside layer on the protector,5
3900,i must say i am very much pleased and would recommend this to anyone who has broke their ipod touch screen,5
3901,this means that you will not have to worry about whether or not you will have enough battery,5
3902,the arms are extremely flexible but they are not so easy to press you accidentally press them,5
3903,they are thin but thick enough to protect the phone but soft enough to be grippable and secure,5
3904,it kinda flexes when i grab it to pull the phone out of it and put it back,5
3905,now that i've had this longer i can say that it's still working great after a year,5
3906,it is a lot bigger then i thought which is nice in my opinion makes it a bit more feminine,5
3907,no charge indicators so you wouldn 8217 t know how much charge you have until it 8217s finished,5
3908,if you buy the bulk packaging version instead of the retail you may only get one ear gel,5
3909,also being thinner and lighter it makes it easy to slip in and out of my pocket,5
3910,so i wanted to get the new trent ultra-thin rugged case for iphone 5 5s is an extremely well made product,5
3911,i decided to pay a little more and see if i could get a fix for the m-50,5
3912,i only got to use it for a few months and it's still going strong,5
3913,but they have never worked so i don't know why they make screen protectors that leave cutouts for notification lights,5
3914,i've had this screen protector on my phone i absolutely love it,5
3915,two batteries and a charger for less than the cost of a 5w apple wall charger,5
3916,all of the cutouts fit perfectly and i don't have to have it on the highest setting,5
3917,the case comes out just enough to protect the screen in case the phone lands on the screen and everything aligns perfectly,5
3918,i keep seeing low ratings and i really don't know what i would do with out it,5
3919,this covers fits very nicely and i like the way it fits the phone and it feels nice in my hand,5
3920,luckily it can also be charged with a micro usb cable since those are a lot more common,5
3921,the hp touchpad 4 g had no battery charge when i plugged it into the wall and it read % 001 charge which seemed odd,5
3922,she has had it for over 2 years now and i still love it,5
3923,uniformity is beautiful the touch sensor is nice so i don't have to carry around with me all day,5
3924,this flimsiness is in the back as well as the sides and how they are ribbed,5
3925,it was purchased for a teenager and we didn't want to spring for an extended battery,5
3926,the only thing i didn't like is that when i put it a holster it starts getting hot,5
3927,of course this meant that i had to go back to this phone,5
3928,during the whole process you should be watching the hole for the home button allows perfectly for touchid to work without issue,5
3929,the red silicone cover has grips on the sides which makes it easier to hold on to the phone not slippery at all,5
3930,i like it i figured out how to use it but i would not buy this phone for the camera,5
3931,the tips should last a while as long as i don't enter a closed room without my phone,5
3932,when powering a device you simply connect it to the device's charger port,5
3933,this was a little less than 5 and it is doing the job it was designed to do and thus five stars,5
3934,overall for the money this is a great case and does a good job keeping your phone charged,5
3935,i have used it for a month and it has been great so far,5
3936,that's a nice feature for some but i really don't like the ear bud style of head phones,5
3937,these screen protectors are great quality but hard to see in the sun but i really love it,5
3938,i've purchased 5 cases for my s3 and this is by far one of my favorite docks for the iphone,5
3939,the case is very slim and does not make my phone too much bigger,5
3940,once the screen protector goes on you can't tell you have a screen protector on your phone due to daily use and possible mishaps,5
3941,unless you love throwing your phone on the floor to test it out,5
3942,the cord could stand to be a little longer but for the price this is a feature packed speaker,5
3943,this one has been my favorite case so far and sadly i've been through a lot of cases,5
3944,it simply is the best i've used and i love the fact that they stay in my ears with no problems,5
3945,and cause it's clear it doesn't take away from the feel of the phone too much,5
3946,the screen protector is easy to install and it works perfectly,5
3947,if you're still rocking an s3 this is likely the best case for the money that i spent,5
3948,it has 2 usb ports so that you can charge two devices at once,5
3949,its a great product it fits the phone and protects the screen just as they said it would,5
3950,i love these wireless setup and it was very easy to use and charged my ipod right away,5
3951,i have charged my ipad 3 ipad mini iphone 4 and 4s and they works flawlessly on all of these devices,5
3952,not only that but it feels like it will be around for a while,5
3953,i am very happy with the design of the case and the additional protection won me over,5
3954,not hard to put on just take your time and make sure you have it on your phone,5
3955,it works better is 1 2 the price of an apple branded wired iphone 5 charger you get a wireless charger,5
3956,i've been using this in my car for about a year and i just bought one for my ipad 3rd gen,5
3957,i use it to hold my samsung galaxy sii epic 4 g touch so needed another belt clip,5
3958,it also has a nice sized lip to protect the screen when placed facedown,5
3959,with this device the fact that i can charge my phone and my ipad at the same time if i am traveling,5
3960,that way i never have to take my hands off the wheel and start typing in commands,5
3961,this little speaker has it all and is pretty loud for its size and the quality is flawless,5
3962,this kit came quickly and was just what i was looking for to show off that color,5
3963,the device feels comfortable in your hand and it's extremely easy to put on and take off your phone,5
3964,i have never tried to use nfc so i can't comment on that company is sending me a replacement,5
3965,great product i love it i recently bought one for my iphone 4s and this case looks really good on the phone,5
3966,this case is very nice you don't have to open the usb lid which makes for keeping my phone waterproof,5
3967,if you are considering a second charger i want to point out that the charger also has short circuit and overcharge protection,5
3968,this is probably not the best case to protect your phone from drops and everyday where and tear,5
3969,this very professional little charger is the perfect solution and what seems to be a factory label so probably made by samsung,5
3970,i purchased this case for my iphone 4s and this is so far the best car charger i have ever owned,5
3971,works well and has enough power to charge my device effectively unlike some chargers,5
3972,fwiw the black doesn't look exactly like the one that came with my phone,5
3973,a built-in led flashlight which is invoked by a quick double press of the on off button of the batterypack,5
3974,i do love this case by ionic so i'll give it 5 stars but i can't really say i love it,5
3975,bee using it since i got it in the mail today which is thursday,5
3976,for my iphone 5 and i am very happy with the purchase and would order another one if i needed it,5
3977,great case for everyday use not too complicated and does add some protection to the back as well but none to the sides,5
3978,based on about a month's trial both batteries seem to hold a charge better than the one that came with the phone,5
3979,it is not bulky but it gives me peace of mind from the inevitable drops to come,5
3980,i currently own 11 cases for my at t iphone 4 it is a perfect fit,5
3981,to preface this review i've gotten quite a few cases for my phone but this is the only one that's held up,5
3982,it was able to charge my droid dna at about 1 % per minute for the samsung note 2 and galaxy s3,5
3983,the phone looks and feels like brand new now and i didn't have to use the rocker volume at work lol,5
3984,i really love this cell phone case for my boyfriend and he loved the case,5
3985,given the flexibility of the case i don't like is the stand,5
3986,comes in a nice black color and is about the size of a pack of cigarettes only slightly thinner,5
3987,the cutouts are perfect and the buttons are easy to press and are well integrated into the case,5
3988,this is faster then the charger that came with my verizon motorola droid x2,5
3989,however i am confident it will protect my phone and i really like the flexibility and the feel of it,5
3990,seriously the first time i used this it took only a few minutes to get the delete done,5
3991,don't try to install it when you're in the car so it won't slide around in the car,5
3992,they arrived in 3 days the clarity on my end is very good and i am extremely satisfied with both,5
3993,bluetooth connection reception unlike the experience some of the other reviewers have older phones and therefore problems with the unit,5
3994,relatively fast and have had no problems with these batteries at all,5
3995,great product for the it was super easy to install and came with an awesome microfiber cleaning cloth,5
3996,the only cons i have for this case is that the white part is very susceptible to getting dirty,5
3997,the power button is kind of hard to press but without a case on it it is a well built well engineered product,5
3998,the bikemate was quick to install and it is easy to take off yet sturdy on my phone,5
3999,it was protected enough not to be damaged when i got it so i had to give it a shot,5
4000,the hands free is terrific pull it out of my pocket and pop it on the mount,5
4001,i didn't want to go back to anything else without that large screen,5
4002,the standard in my opinion for those who work in a noisy environment such as my husband,5
4003,note it did take a while to get to 100 %,5
4004,to me it just allows me to be able to watch my phone and not have to fight my daughter for the charger,5
4005,now i have this little box not much bigger than a deck of cards will be my emergency back up plan,5
4006,i will not easily drop the phone in this case it will be protected,5
4007,i haven't tried drowning the speaker though so keep that in mind when i talk about certain features,5
4008,while multi-port chargers are easily found this is the first one i used with my current razr 4 g phone,5
4009,with other car chargers if i was using the gps camera and phone much,5
4010,i love these cables they are extra long which makes it a lot easier to keep a handle on this slippery bastard to boot,5
4011,it still lets you use the touch screen as if there was no screen protector on there at all,5
4012,charge it overnight and keep it on charger in the car and when i am out it's there for me,5
4013,i had the screen protector on my galaxy s4 for months now and there is no real noticeable scratches and looks brand new,5
4014,it is the main app on your phone that allows you to control the volume and the on off button with minimal effort,5
4015,the form factor is exactly so you can use it with most of the common plugs,5
4016,love the case it's simple and easy to use and has a stylish design,5
4017,because it is soft it is easy to put on the phone and a simple new look for the phone,5
4018,when the screen is on you'd be hard pressed to do any better with any other speaker,5
4019,it recharges pretty fast too with the wall charger that comes with your phone so not a big deal,5
4020,this case is really cute and looks exactly like in the picture it's super cute and it fit perfectly,5
4021,at first it looked funny when i opened it but when i put it on it feels like you're not even wearing it,5
4022,pairing was simple with the headset pairing with my kindle fire hdx 7 tablet the kindle fire hdx 8,5
4023,oftentimes i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices is increasingly becoming a major hassle,5
4024,they weren't kidding when they state 3d lol you wont be able to give a strong current to 2 tablets simultaneously,5
4025,there are a few areas that would make this battery pack even more appealing to me,5
4026,i love the convience of this item because you don't always have to carry around the power adapter is great,5
4027,i just got this yesterday march 26 and i can't say how much higher quality this case is compared to the otterbox,5
4028,it's beautiful exactly what it looks like in the picture and the price is best,5
4029,no nfc but i can't tell the difference between these and wired headphones,5
4030,for the weight and the size this is by far the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost,5
4031,i also like how the color of the light lets you know when the charger is in use,5
4032,this was a god send i'm so glad i purchased this one instead of the cup one,5
4033,with decent usage i was able to get three days out of it easily before i recharge it,5
4034,it's the best portable computing device i've ever used and i've gone through tonsa screen protectors over the years,5
4035,both batteries seem to last about as long as the battery that came with my phone,5
4036,they work perfectly are much cheaper than you can get at walmart and it was exactly as described in the photo,5
4037,it fits like a glove although the on off button is a bit hard to push but that will probable loosen a bit with use,5
4038,the outer case is molded rubber that entirely covers the back and sides of the phone and it looks very good,5
4039,i've only had it a few days so not sure how long the charge last in terms of hours,5
4040,i have 6 smaller usb iphone battery extenders and this is the only one that seems to be worth the money,5
4041,this charger is exactly what i needed to protect my new nokia e71x phone,5
4042,the raised lip allows you to put you phone face down and not worry about anything on a smooth surface touching the screen,5
4043,best part it doesn't make you feel like the phone is about to slip out but not this one,5
4044,it does exactly what it says it does i highly recommend this to any evo owner not happy with the stock battery,5
4045,the sound quality is great and it's easy to take in and out,5
4046,it also comes with proprietary mini usb plug and a standard usb port for charging other devices,5
4047,i bought this to use with my htc evo and it works better than the original battery that came with my fone and works well,5
4048,i really like that the blue light turns on when a device is placed on the designated qi area,5
4049,the case also makes as a stand so you can stand it up which is great for using the side led modes,5
4050,i have dropped my phone more than once with this case on and it wasn't damaged,5
4051,recommended to all iphone 5 owners i am currently using it with my ouya and love it,5
4052,i can not say how long it will last but it holds up well,5
4053,so update i've had this wallet for months now and i like it very much its just so nice to make it match,5
4054,it is so light weight that i barely notice that it's even on my iphone,5
4055,ankerdirect was responsive proactive and initiated contact with me to make sure we are 100 % satisfied,5
4056,i love my case it fits perfect i've already dropped my phone twice and the case doesn't even have a scratch on it,5
4057,i also play games that require a minimum of 1-2 hours a day,5
4058,and i can hear the other party fine and i have had no complaints that my voice is coming through muffled,5
4059,the screen will not touch a flat surface when the phone is placed face down on a surface,5
4060,this charger does exactly what i would have expected it to do which is to sit still plugged into a sound dock,5
4061,the case also provides a good grip and the raised edge around the screen protects so you can lay it face down,5
4062,and that as far as i'm concerned the callquality is so much better with the s-pen holder,5
4063,she did say thw home button is a little hard to press but other than that i love the case,5
4064,i had a bad charger once and they sent me a new one so it was def not a fake,5
4065,was in great condition and didn't have any trouble with the ultra using my iphone,5
4066,i've now been using it for a few weeks now and absolutely love it,5
4067,i've dropped the phone from a table with this on and no damage not that i recommend dropping your phone,5
4068,this case has a great feels and it is easy to find a replacement it is just a standard cable,5
4069,i went a little case-crazy when i pre-ordered my galaxy s3 last year and still love it,5
4070,i do recommend this item for anyone looking for an extra battery pack for a tablet,5
4071,there's one supplied cord which is a standard usb to micro usb cable and charge it off any pc in an emergency,5
4072,i am using this to make a pair of bluetooth headphones and i am glad i did,5
4073,when the case is on there's a small opening at the top for putting this on a key ring,5
4074,and it works so well i don't know why others are having a hard time with theirs,5
4075,i have two of these first one was given to me as a gift and i did not purchase it on amazon,5
4076,when it arrived i thought it would be too bulky but those concerns were unfounded,5
4077,i personally preferballistic sg1072-m385 silicone tpu sg protector case for samsung galaxy note 2 since they are both made by the same company,5
4078,and i am really impressed by how well it has protected my phone the backside looks good as new,5
4079,this item charges my phone quickly is easy to carry in my purse and not be worried about my battery dying,5
4080,i've had this product for about two weeks now and have used it with my various devices,5
4081,do not regret purchasing this phone recommend to anyone looking for a basic case with this pretty guy on it,5
4082,no dice i'm telling you once you get used to the size after about a week,5
4083,the case adds a lip so you can place your phone face down on a counter rubbing against things in your pocket etc,5
4084,this was easy to put on and remove but still seems secure and doesn't fall off and the cradle also holds the phone safely,5
4085,it comes in handy when i really need to charge my phone and i don't always like to carry my purse around,5
4086,i have to say this is by far one of the best i've used,5
4087,the charger itself is small and not bulky like some of the other protective cases those are designed and positioned to work perfectly,5
4088,just like the one that came in the phone and it's nice to have my mophie juice pack as a back up,5
4089,can trust it as i take a lot of pictures and it can be a little clumsy sometimes to get both devices plugged in,5
4090,i have not had the pleasure to use it yet but i have it when i will need it,5
4091,you can't take this phone and switch over to at t or rip-off price gouging verizon in the future,5
4092,however i didn't need to do so when i use it with my note 3 it didn't happen again,5
4093,this case is a perfect fit and it looks great too,5
4094,i own this same phone for over a year now and still going strong looks brand new still,5
4095,this charger is great i liked both ports it works perfectly with my iphone 4s with an otter box case,5
4096,i don't use a phone case that wraps around the back and sides of the phone and you hardly notice it is even there,5
4097,it requires a double press of the power button to turn on 2 presses to turn off,5
4098,looks cute shipped fast and i feel like it will just snap in half,5
4099,it's easy to apply if your phone doesn't have a very good rating here at amazon,5
4100,it came fast in the mail and it's a very nice calming color,5
4101,you can charge slow if you dont want to carry your purse you just grab this,5
4102,this is the only way to go if you use your phone as a gps to reach your destination,5
4103,i can see my screen clearly and there are 3 in the pack and you can replace it as needed,5
4104,it's nice and thin and doesn't add too much heft to the phone at all,5
4105,didn't have any trouble getting the phone in and it is simple to remove as well,5
4106,i bought this extended battery and back cover i had purchased,5
4107,here i can take the ear buds out of my ears and i was constantly pushing them back in,5
4108,delivery was a bit long like 2 weeks but it was worth it trust me i am an electrician,5
4109,i love this screen protector i have dropped my phone on multiple occasions with no damage at all to the iphone,5
4110,i've used it for about a month now and is still working great,5
4111,nothing you can't clean off but that's the only thing i don't like about it is,5
4112,i bought this case to use with my samsung galaxy 4s and 8,5
4113,i love and can not say it enough i love this case i will be buyin one for me soon,5
4114,the unit works but it does not seem to be an issue like others fear,5
4115,the case is works well for me and i'm quite pleased with it,5
4116,i bought this case for my iphone 4s and now i wanted one again,5
4117,i also wear the buff which i have reviewed on amazon so that i don't have to carry my wallet anymore,5
4118,but the phone got lots of attention because it is so small and practically blends in with the car,5
4119,even though i don't use it often but when i do it does the job,5
4120,it would be nice if it charged with a micro usb cable when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic,5
4121,there is an indicator to show you how much battery is left before connecting,5
4122,the pen twists for the pen to appear on the opposite end of the pack from the usb port charging port,5
4123,not only are the specs incredible quad-core processor 2 gb ram 16 32 gb sd no rear 5 mp front 1,5
4124,1 galaxy note 2 at the same time and if i don't use them for commuting anymore just for working out,5
4125,i even like the metal cap on the end to keep the touch screen from getting scratched,5
4126,they are relatively easy to apply to the screen just make sure the screen is very clean before you put it on,5
4127,the headset is very easy to wear for long periods of time than this but i found it to be simple and effective,5
4128,to charge this battery plug it into a computer usb port or into the wall via the included wall outlet adapter,5
4129,i already had the mini hdmi cable so it was just a matter of plugging it in and making a call,5
4130,there seems to be a lot of these types of cases so i can change them with my mood,5
4131,they tend to cost a bit more but in this case you really get what you paid for,5
4132,and it still looks great and is holding up very well under steady use,5
4133,the cable is a little pricey but it's worth it,5
4134,i would highly recommend this to anyone who spends a lot of time traveling in my car,5
4135,i was looking for a lightweight slim and functional case for my phone with a few minor drawbacks as noted above,5
4136,every morning before work i just wipe it with the micro-fiber cloth before you attempt to install it,5
4137,it slides easily and now that have used it for a few weeks now and no complaints,5
4138,work outside with gloves and this makes it so nice i don't have to look for the device for ever,5
4139,it's a good choice if you're looking for a holster style case this is it,5
4140,they say to never judge a book by its cover that's for sure,5
4141,as long as the quality is better or at least as good as the regular jambox or mini jambox but louder,5
4142,defender series cases come standard with a belt-clip holster is always an added bonus,5
4143,i sent them back and ordered these as soon as i was able to get almost the entire screen bubble free,5
4144,it's original just like the one that came with my otter box was crap,5
4145,it charges both android and iphone at the same time and they both charge much quicker than usual,5
4146,i've been very happy with it and it's great for the price and works excellent,5
4147,overall this case is excellent and you can't beat the price here and it does feel like leather,5
4148,i love mine because it fits my phone perfectly and it has a very good magnetic clasp,5
4149,they fit tightly in the micro usb port of the wireless charger and the usb into a computer or for best results a 2,5
4150,i would recommend to anyone in need of screen protectors for my new phone,5
4151,ive been buying these protectors for a few years now but this is the first one i truly love,5
4152,for the price ofthis car charger you simply can not go wrong with this backup battery charger if you have an iphone,5
4153,these are nice cords they are well made and the price was good as well,5
4154,they work very well to charge my samsung galaxy s2 as well as iphone and other cellphones,5
4155,my only regret that i have with this device is the little blue light,5
4156,it is very easy to use and quick to get your phone in and out once you get the hang of it its all good,5
4157,they have definitely knocked one out of the park with the ultra hybrid crystal clear case,5
4158,it was great to just through in my bag and charge my phone whenever i needed to,5
4159,i don't use my cell phone much but when i do use it it has a tab that locks the belt clip open,5
4160,the charger looks nice and has a solid and well-built piece of sonic assault awaits your ears,5
4161,it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers around the home at work and in the car,5
4162,i'd highly recommend these cords to anyone who needs a replacement charger for a samsung phone other brands of phone,5
4163,after a few months with this case on my phone it really brings out my phone i like it a lot thanks so much,5
4164,what i like best about this usb car charger is the best car charger i've seen,5
4165,also where the phone plugs into the dock it's a little getting used too especially a lot wider than iphone,5
4166,there are other cases that do both simultaneously which i think would be a little more accurate although the finish is very clean,5
4167,99 here on amazon and in my opinion this is a very high quality case for the price,5
4168,running cyanogenmod 9 aokp i'm able to go more than a day without recharging my phone even with a very light telephony use,5
4169,this feature has spoiled me and it's one of the best that i've used,5
4170,i do love this one because it does what it says it does and did a great job,5
4171,it comes up and around the front of the phone are not too distracting,5
4172,it appears to be identical to the charger that came with the phone,5
4173,from the minute you unpack it you can tell it's well made and it's meant to last long,5
4174,i loved this case so much that i also bought one for my wife again excellent light well worth it,5
4175,excellent quality and just the right size for the phone then,5
4176,this is my first matte finish case and i have to say that i am very pleased with how well it worked,5
4177,this case for the s4 was pretty much the same as the old model decent for the price,5
4178,there is also a small raised edge on the front of the case and pavement pits on the back,5
4179,this plantronics headset has plenty of loud volume if that's what you want this isn't the phone for you,5
4180,not bulky it allows me to place the phone face down on a flat surface,5
4181,it feels good in my hand and gives a good grip on the phone even with all that extra weight,5
4182,i received the item on time and i am really happy with them,5
4183,i know it's optional to put it on but if you follow the direction you'll get it right,5
4184,goes over the front also so if you drop it face down flat the screen theoretically should not touch the ground,5
4185,it has a cool light that lets you know it is plugged in and working,5
4186,i purchased it for a gift and the person is really happy with it,5
4187,one thing i can say is be sure to read the instructions on the back of the package,5
4188,this fits effortlessly and charge my phone quickly and the extra usb port is pretty genius,5
4189,this is a great case if you're looking for a case in tiffany co,5
4190,i was needing a replacment cover for my phone and this one by far is the most impressive screen protector i've ever used,5
4191,i got it about the time they said i would and i love it,5
4192,it's actually a hard black plastic case and the purple is a deeper richer purple than what the picture shows,5
4193,charges quickly build quality is good and it has a cool blue light that glows to let you know when it is powered,5
4194,i've been using it for a week now and i'm very happy to say that it does what it is suppose to do,5
4195,for carrying there is a small hole at the bottom of the holster which aids this process,5
4196,it is very well designed and provides a lot of protection for the i phone 4 and comes with a stylus,5
4197,the headphones are light but not don't feel cheap and the sticker holds up well under usage,5
4198,the best part is it keeps the camera lens from being scratched up since it raises the lens off the table,5
4199,while it doesn't charge my phone with the case on but i feel confident that the phone is protected,5
4200,both usb ports work and is capable of charging 2 devices at the same time and equally well,5
4201,i will upgrade to something heavy duty in the future but for now i am happy with the ones i have,5
4202,the speaker uses a rechargeable internal battery that can be charged via a usb cord and i would highly recommend it,5
4203,fits perfectly on my phone and does not cover any of the inputs nor does it inhibit the camera,5
4204,this holder was supplied to me in exchange for an honest review and very glad that i liked it so well,5
4205,gives me a good charge and i would highly recommend it to others who may need one,5
4206,the case is slim fits the phone very well and protects the phone very well,5
4207,this is my 2nd llifeproof case and i would recommend them to anyone with a samsung galaxy s4,5
4208,have used it for about a week now and have had no issues with the phone not charging,5
4209,i should point out that although you can use a micro usb cable to charge the power bank which is not included,5
4210,this phone is already a big phone so they have done a great job on this item,5
4211,it is very very sturdy long and the fact that it comes with a pouch with all the adapters you will need,5
4212,like other elago cases this one doesn't look like it will work but it does and its pretty cool,5
4213,i have been using otterbox for over three years now and i don't have a ac plug with me,5
4214,i found the battery life was not nearly as good as the integrated skype on the windows phone,5
4215,with using the device for several days now but so far it is what i was looking for in a phone holder,5
4216,doesnt impede on any of the functions of the phone charging volume power button etc,5
4217,i love the style and it fits perfectly on my phone and very well protected,5
4218,this is the cutest case i've got so far for my htc one,5
4219,the only draw back is that the case is a little slippery but you can get used to that,5
4220,i now don't have to carry around my wallet separately,5
4221,but according to my husband the real beauty of it is that it can be used with devices other than the specified blackberry models,5
4222,but does not add a lot of bulk this should be at the top of everyone's list,5
4223,i'm glad to not have to carry my wallet around all the time,5
4224,i hate bluetooth audio and have never been able to get working and that required android 3,5
4225,i ended up buying their charger that came with another battery so i will always have an extra charged battery with me just in case,5
4226,i wasn't sure what sand meant when i bought it but i miss the reflective surface of the actual phone,5
4227,my car only has one lighter jack in the front so it's not completely flush with the phone,5
4228,i would definitely recommend this if you are going to put a screen protector do it first,5
4229,it's well made and easy to take on and off and went shopping for a new case,5
4230,this is a great size usable for many devices and will be great to use at the gym while jogging etc,5
4231,i was shopping for a while for a good extra battery for my phone and i don't have any negative comments,5
4232,call quality is great i cant tell the difference between this one and the original,5
4233,it is the soft gel feeling plastic with a glossy finish on the sides with the back being a matte grey,5
4234,i'm using this headset with an android phone and the sound is very good both for music and phone calls,5
4235,i've owned a number of bluetooth headsets over the years and this is my 4th different iphone 5 case,5
4236,i've been using a samsung convoy 2 feature phone for a couple of years and i contemplated getting it fixed locally for like 100,5
4237,i loved the price and they were easy to put on and protected his phone nicely,5
4238,i can get two full charges for my iphone 4s out of the device,5
4239,been using it for about a week now and so far the screen is holding up well,5
4240,you can peel and stick the metal plate to the back of your bare phone that is visible all the time,5
4241,at the current price i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who drops their phone a lot,5
4242,for 2 or3 dollars i did not expect much but i was pleasantly surprised,5
4243,with armorsuit military shield i was able to apply the screen protector and it went on very easily and bubbles did not cause a problem,5
4244,it doesn't add an unreasonable amount of bulk to the phone the fit is secure and snug,5
4245,i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to dress up their phone,5
4246,box is just what i needed to repair my iphone 3gs cracked screen,5
4247,because of this i don't expect the best protection for the phone but i think a ziplock bag can be used when necessary,5
4248,the same has held true for the battery in my wife's s3 because it was draining really fast,5
4249,i can't distinguish it from the one that came with my nexus 7 and was charging immediately,5
4250,iphone 5s overall it's the best case i have bought for my phone,5
4251,the case fits the phone well and has easy grip on the sides so the phone edges its way out,5
4252,this was intended as a stop gap case because it was cheap and a hard case instead of a soft gel type,5
4253,i have had this phone for about 2 weeks and i am very satified with the product,5
4254,it fits just like it should the buttons are easy to push unlike the last case i had purchased,5
4255,so that you don't have to take the phone out of the case added convenience and protection,5
4256,this is a great deal and they work great as long as you are not expecting the newer apple lightning cable,5
4257,the only thing that some people might not like is that it adds half an inch to your cell,5
4258,it holds a full charge especially when i got it in the mail about 2 3 days after that date,5
4259,doing some simple math i should be able to charge my phone in several different places throughout my house and cars,5
4260,the candyshell is made very well and seems like it would provide good protection for the phone,5
4261,i love the stylus on this pen because it makes it so much easier to deal with than the usual straight plug,5
4262,i'm a mom and i bought this one for myself and it really blows me away,5
4263,i would highly recommend it if you are looking for an extended battery this is the one to get to protect your awesome phone,5
4264,i had a couple of different cases for my iphone 5s and this one is cool,5
4265,i can not even tell there is a cover over the volume buttons as well as the off and on button,5
4266,this product is no joke and i will never buy any other protector for any of my devices,5
4267,i gave it to my daughter in law and she likes it a lot to charger her phone thank you,5
4268,it will save your phone even if you drop it on the face but will protect the corners and back,5
4269,it can charge my phone up from empty to 100 % and still have enough juice to give an s3 a complete charge,5
4270,who knew that this is all it would take to get the most out of their hyundai factory stereo without factory bluetooth,5
4271,the adhesive is double sided and i used it for a while and see how it works for me,5
4272,it is very slim lightweight and goes in and out of pockets with zero problems at all,5
4273,these protecters are great to have because they can protect the front and back of the phone more than i expected,5
4274,i'll update my review once i have used the case for about a week and it is doing just great,5
4275,it allows for convenient charging and i don't need to trust the quality of third party replacements,5
4276,the charger comes with two ports for you to charge your devices at the same time or even two devices at the same time,5
4277,excellent product makes me feel that my phone is secure and safe from my clumsy habits,5
4278,a very affordable alternative to bose at a fraction of the cost for similar items this is a great bargain,5
4279,update i have had my battery for a week now and all i can say is that it has never giving out on me,5
4280,on the other hand if you don't intend to use it as a makeshift 34 tripod 34 for some small product videography,5
4281,i had used rearth cases in the past and the quality of this one is very good and it's charging quickly,5
4282,you do get 3 protectors just in case you mess one up and have to do it again,5
4283,hey i have this product and i would definitely buy another one when this one if ever,5
4284,this particular spigen case beats all of the other cases out there but it's actually solid,5
4285,techmatte advise you to use their method of installing a screen protector but you can buy these on amazon for a buck or two,5
4286,i have used the energizer 18000xl for about a year and it works great for charging two devices,5
4287,i think i might get another for the other charging port in my truck free for a third rider to use,5
4288,we needed a charger that would be able to charge a full charge plus another half charge,5
4289,the quality of this screen protector compared to others i have purchased in the past and this is one of the best,5
4290,i've used a lot of cases and this one feels like it is made better and will hold up better,5
4291,so you can hear fine but the people on the other end of the line identified herself as a skinomi representative,5
4292,item is in a great quality and i haven't had any problems carrying the phone in my pocket,5
4293,i actually bought one as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it it is so cute,5
4294,it's slim enough that i can still put it in my pocket if i want to,5
4295,the stand up apperance is great because it serves as an alarm clock as well you will enjoy having it on this docking system,5
4296,i'm happy to report that this headset has exceeded my expectations in a bluetooth stereo headset,5
4297,i like the way it connects to my phone as soon as i start the car and retains a solid connection,5
4298,i don't mind since i keep it in my laptop bag and i am always ready to go,5
4299,i am so pleased with this product that i bought another set for my aunt who likes to work on things too,5
4300,due to my previous positive experiences with their products i decided to try this one for my recenlty purchased note 2,5
4301,as i write this i haven't been able to get on 4 g anywhere in south maryland,5
4302,my phone actually didn't come with one of these but it works and thats all that matters,5
4303,my only complaint is that it took about two weeks to get them but well well worth it,5
4304,the case is comfortable in the hand doesn't add too much bulk to the device while keeping it safe,5
4305,fyi when using with a computer you will need to use the charger for your phone or tablet,5
4306,as a matter of fact it feels so good in your hands and i love that it's been protected superbly thus far,5
4307,worked very well out lasted the life of the phone and i still have no known damage,5
4308,i ordered this case for my wife and it fits great,5
4309,i've had it for a year now and it's still working as it did on day one,5
4310,i paid the lg with my iphone in the car and the phone often goes dead,5
4311,all of my clients loved them and they do exactly what they're designed to do well and this is the case is no different,5
4312,i also love the fact that it's clear so you can see the apple logo,5
4313,negatives button placement the worst thing on the phone is the placement of the microsd card inside the battery compartment,5
4314,the keys are a bit tough to press and others have cut-outs for the main and rear mics,5
4315,this is a thing that i like so much i'm thinking of buying a second pair to keep at the office,5
4316,makes the phone a bit heavy but it's worth it,5
4317,this is due to raised surface over these buttons which makes it easy to find a big plus in my family,5
4318,i love the fact that if i screw up putting it on my phone i hated the way the resolution looked,5
4319,i bought mine earlier this year and paid a lot more for and he lliked this one just as much as my other,5
4320,this was the third case i bought for my phone as a temporary replacement,5
4321,only thing is that i have to take the case off to put the phone in the case it came out almost immediately,5
4322,by far a better design than some of the other battery chargers i have,5
4323,the head that the usbs plug into is not bulky and it doesn't even look like i have a screen protector on,5
4324,the thicker tip is replaceable so if it wears out you don't have to spend a ton of money this i really enjoyed,5
4325,i won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can see in the pic show the charge left in the power bank,5
4326,you always know how much juice is left on the battery,5
4327,it was well packaged fit the phone like a glove and does exactly what it should do,5
4328,i did have a problem but i don't think it's oem goes in my phone reversed,5
4329,works great with my samsung galaxy s3 and the note 7,5
4330,i've only had this for a few days i was thoroughly impressed,5
4331,also with the cable separate from the lighter jack it can be placed in a pants pocket with a lot of room to spare,5
4332,i have used cheaper versions of these in the past and this one is lighter and more comfortable,5
4333,i will tell you in advance that this is probably one of my favorite amazon purchases in 2013,5
4334,i won't own a different type of case for my iphone 4s and again bought for iphone 5,5
4335,final words even though i think it is a bit bulky but given the power that may be required,5
4336,as well i've even dropped my phone a few times and nothing has happened to it,5
4337,with chargers i don't like to take my phone out of the otterbox,5
4338,microsoft office is quite good though though i have not found a way to remove the darn clip without breaking it,5
4339,way more than i thought i would and i don't really have too much trouble using the phone,5
4340,and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone looking for a dual port car charger,5
4341,overall for the price i don't think you can wet install the sides,5
4342,it has a rubbery grip that makes me feel like i have my og droid in my hand again,5
4343,overall very happy with this product and would recommend it to anybody that needs a car charger with the same charging pin,5
4344,this tape looks like it will work just fine but with a blackberry we,5
4345,i hate using a phone without a case but what if you want to watch a video with multiple people,5
4346,also it's great because i can just put it in my purse and i'm good to go,5
4347,i recommend tying a string through this so that it doesn't block the second plug on a standard wall outlet,5
4348,there is a raised lip on the front and back along with a receipt,5
4349,i have been a fan of tpu cases for a long time now and all of the gems are still on,5
4350,it's not as bulky as most of the other batteries that i've used or come across,5
4351,i found this sim card to be exactly what i needed and the cord is very well made and does not get damaged easy,5
4352,it seems to charge quickly there are indicator lights to let you know if its low and needs to be charged,5
4353,it doesn't have that much of protection but it is still a great deal for just the pen alone,5
4354,i do it and need to depend on my phone for work and life in general having a spare battery is great,5
4355,works great allows me to charge my tablet and phone at the same time while driving down the road,5
4356,rubberized finish feels great and provides the perfect amount of protection but isn't bulky,5
4357,no interference whatsoever no problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo wally world receiver adapter is just a happy marriage,5
4358,i sync my phone at home and at work and i bought this one to replace it,5
4359,access to all ports is easy and power and volume buttons are easy to press mushy affect to them at all,5
4360,i love this case so much i ordered another one in a different color to mix and match lol,5
4361,glad that i came across these and would recommend them to anyone in the market for an extra charging cable,5
4362,i've been using diztronic for tpu cases for about a year now and it is the best one i have seen,5
4363,overall i am very please with this product and would recommend to friends family and co-workers,5
4364,to charge a device just plug it in with a usb to micro usb cable and charge it off any pc in an emergency,5
4365,overall it is an good quality product that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units,5
4366,downside is that it only comes with a protector for the back so that is a plus,5
4367,the reason for confusion was because the case has a built-in hard back that perfectly fits the nokia 520,5
4368,had an evo for 2-years because at the time it was the best vzw phone i've ever owned,5
4369,it feels solid and great in my hand and works very well with my i5 phone,5
4370,i never had any issues with otterbox defender cases it really protects your phone i'm gon na order in black next,5
4371,used it for a month now and it is still holding up to all of our charging needs,5
4372,i expect this to get a lot of use from this awesome pack,5
4373,you can charge the phone and tablet at the same time and still had charge left,5
4374,i've had this for 3 months now and it's still working perfect,5
4375,all in all works great i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great looking functional case,5
4376,i am glad to buy this 5 pack of clear screen protectors for samsung galaxy mini s3 are so productive and beautifull,5
4377,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap pen for your ipad,5
4378,this mount holder can fit many sized phones and i don't have to keep my phone directly on me while doing yard work,5
4379,the flashlight capability is not really needed but it is a nice touch and shows that the company cares about their products and their customers,5
4380,it worked great for my droid phone my kindle fire and my ipad extremely economical and very sturdy,5
4381,the packaging is perfect and the i would recommend this product to anyone who was looking for samsung captivate galaxys phone these work great,5
4382,i purchased this case as a gift and it is so much fun to play with them too,5
4383,this product saved my phone as soon i put it on the phone it feels weird almost sticky,5
4384,this new battery makes the s3 very similar in size and weight and it has the standard 1 8 3,5
4385,but because they went the extra mile to make sure i was happy with them a few days later,5
4386,it is rubberized so it does have some cushion if the phone is dropped but it definitely will protect the camera from scratching,5
4387,this is great very well priced also and it is always nice to spend less time charging my phone,5
4388,i'm very partial to otterbox when it comes to phone cases and this one was so pretty,5
4389,operation is easy and straightforward 8211 just connect the device you want to recharge and turn the power bank on,5
4390,on the s3 and evo v you need to remove the battery or sim or sd card,5
4391,if anything happens to the durability of the item i will be sure to update if its chipping but it looks amazing to me,5
4392,wont charge battery and cellphone at the same time i think it deserves its five stars,5
4393,for me it meant a slight problem when i tried to use the iphone charging cord it wouldn't fit,5
4394,the great thing about this is you can throw it in your purse without damaging your phone,5
4395,only have been using it for less than a week but it's by far the best i've ever used,5
4396,every headset i have used in the past it does not feel like it's going to fall apart in a month,5
4397,also protects the phone i have dropped my phone several times on hard surfaces and the cover protected my phone pretty good,5
4398,i had my own charging cable so i can't speak to how it works in that respect,5
4399,the color is a perfect mint color and it fits my phone perfectly and i have access to the sd card that stores images,5
4400,i'll often leave the phone on my desk or in my pocket so for me it's not a make or break option,5
4401,charging times are a little longer than the charger that comes with it charges the oem too,5
4402,as benchmarks will attest to the average person won't notice much of a change inside even with the booster correctly installed,5
4403,i recommend this case so far is the best one i've ever had,5
4404,even so it can fit in my pocket when i don't want to carry my pocketbook,5
4405,instead of buying a new camera that i was not sure if it would have one and am i glad,5
4406,it works better than the original battery that came with the phone when i bought it at the store,5
4407,i've had this battery for about a month now and no problems so far,5
4408,discovery 925 is very comfortable to wear though it did take a few weeks to come to me from china,5
4409,it also charged my iphone 5s more then 3 times and my ipad mini twice before it runs out of juice,5
4410,it doesn't add to much weight or bulk to the phone but i can not subtract points on that issue,5
4411,you can barely tell it's even there but it does make it easier for dirt to lodge around the edge,5
4412,it really cuts down the glare now i can see who's calling and answer from the b,5
4413,it is very nice to see a wall charger that will charge 2 ipads at the same time with no issues noted,5
4414,the film products are excellant and i have never had any complaints from callers about sound quality,5
4415,it looks great and it did a great job at protecting my screen,5
4416,when i first placed it on my phone it took a little time to get used to but its well worth it,5
4417,it was just too easy for the phone to come out unless you take it out,5
4418,i thought for sure i would have to take the back armor skin off,5
4419,the ismooth 4 ft apple 30-pin cable is a very high quality cable that works well and is well made,5
4420,i used it to charge my phone a couple of times and no damage to the phone including a few drops,5
4421,i was able to charge the phone and still be able to see the phone,5
4422,go for this one there is no reason you should not enjoy this case,5
4423,the included screen protector is easy to install and it hasn't fallen off,5
4424,i am not concerned at all about the time it takes to charge but you have to expect that,5
4425,installation was simple and straightforward and the protector fits very well on my phone and it feels about the same to me,5
4426,i was also skeptical about being able to place my phone in my pocket together with my keys,5
4427,happy enough to order another one for the bedroom so that i can use it without needing my reading glasses,5
4428,it was very simple to put it on the phone without any bubbles,5
4429,for the promotional price i paid 2 i would buy again in a heart beat due to i hate cables,5
4430,the iphone 4 4s is a seriously slim smartphone and this case is perfect for protection and showing off my skin,5
4431,i would recommend for anyone who is looking for a great charger for their phone,5
4432,a micro usb port is used for charging the battery pack and the other is a micro usb connector for charging,5
4433,i had a speck case for my iphone 5 but it is so adjustable about any phone should fit fine,5
4434,i was relieved when i received it and it was more than i expected for that price,5
4435,i was very careful to clean the screen of any smudges or prints completely along with any dust,5
4436,so when i got a samsung galaxy s4 and it works really well,5
4437,i read the reviews before buying and decided to go for it despite reports of duds crazy risk-taker,5
4438,amazing product and it looks just like the picture i will recommend this case,5
4439,brighter colors make the phone stand out when i toss it in my purse or lose it on the couch,5
4440,i use them interchangeably storing one in each of our vehicles so i can clean the screen on that when i charge it each night,5
4441,product is just as described and works right out of the box with my sony stereo which has a dock,5
4442,i was concerned with how frail the case was going to be a hard case but it really isn't,5
4443,would highly recommend this product and i will buy from this seller any time,5
4444,only caveat is that the case is a little sketchy when you want to take it out of the case,5
4445,the fogging clears up fairly quickly and is not a problem but i wanted to know the time frame,5
4446,well done new trent and i would highly recommend this product for like-minded users,5
4447,i have a slim tpu case for my iphone 5 and it fit well and i love the product,5
4448,love this case because it fits perfectly the new htc one m8 and the new galaxy s5 are not qi ready,5
4449,considering the price and quality i am very satisfied with this case and holster combo especially at the current price,5
4450,don't buy it if you're prone to dropping your phone a lot then get a more heavy duty case,5
4451,these phone pods are amazing you can charge your phone while charging a battery by using the usb port to your phone,5
4452,it is compact and the case is durable so it is easy to take in and out to change extra batteries,5
4453,i've been using case by elago since the iphone 5 came out screen protectors have become a necessity in my opinion,5
4454,comes with a built in screen protector so i decided to purchase the black on white or vice versa,5
4455,now while i am working on my computer and someone calls i don't need to walk over to my phone,5
4456,a giant chunk of the time i use my phone for an extended period of time,5
4457,i've used a lot of bluetooth headsets over the years and this one so far is my favorite,5
4458,everything i touch on my screen with it responds and i haven't had any connection problems between my droid 2 android phone,5
4459,i bought this for myself but my sister loved it so i gave it to my 21 year old daughter and she just loved it,5
4460,it connects quickly and once you get used to the feel of the plastic protector,5
4461,there is a bevel on the screen side so you can put your phone with your keys and your screen will be perfect,5
4462,in the stock configuration i barely got through the day on a single charge you'll be happy you did,5
4463,you don't even notice that you have a screen protection in your phone,5
4464,it's well made for the price i paid for it a week ago,5
4465,great case but does not offer as much protection as some cases but no problems so far,5
4466,i've had these for almost a year now and still is one of the few items i take with me wherever i go,5
4467,at that time i wished i had an otterbox case for my iphone 4 a few months ago,5
4468,and it doesn't affect the sensitivity of the screen to touches and swipes,5
4469,with this cable plug set up i no longer have to take my wallet with me all the time,5
4470,ive dropped this phone a few times and it has lasted very well and protected my phone,5
4471,but i have no idea how many charges i can get from my galaxy tab2,5
4472,overall i'm pleased to have had the opportunity to test it right away,5
4473,i prefer the feel and smoothness of the glass on the phone and all the information of your contacts show up,5
4474,but it works great and is so tiny i can carry it with me and supplement my phone while i am using it,5
4475,my son has thrown his phone several times and so far this dual piece case has protected it,5
4476,he has been using this battery for about 5 days an it charges my phone faster than my home charger which is great,5
4477,this is by far one of the best cases i have ever put on my phone and is so smooth to the touch,5
4478,i keep it in my glovebox in case i forgot to charge my phone i always use my phone as my gps in the car,5
4479,all the cut outs are perfect and it's at a great price considering all of the above and i recommend it,5
4480,i like to use a stylus at times with my ipad and i noticed it didn't really work,5
4481,i know from experience because i dropped my phone with this case yet so i love the exclusivity and rareness of it,5
4482,i have tried other screen protectors and had all but given up on blue tooth head sets until now,5
4483,i was able to get 13 hours while connected to 4 g lte full time with the display at about 50 %,5
4484,was concerned because a few reviews reported how difficult it was to get the headphone jack in around his old case,5
4485,if you're prone to dropping your phone this is not the stand for you though,5
4486,fits easily in my coat pockets and i've used it several times now and it is still in great shape,5
4487,tried alot of other bluetooth with my iphone 4s and this one is by far the best i have ever had for my samsung gs3,5
4488,i have dropped the phone and not a scratch on it and no problems with the phone,5
4489,however i do have a kindle fire and have been able to easily make my phone last a day,5
4490,i expected it to happen just like when i put the case on so 2 full charges is guaranteed,5
4491,it is stylish and it is just what i wanted and the price was excellent,5
4492,fits my droid 3 with theotterbox commuter series hybrid case for iphone 4 4s retail packaging black,5
4493,adds very little thickness to the phone which is great for my use,5
4494,i bought mine outright for 764 dollars and it was worth every penny that i paid for it,5
4495,it's far less prone to scratches than any other screen protector i've purchased in the last 2 years,5
4496,batteries seem to work just as well as the one that came with the phone im sure it is of high quality too,5
4497,the card slots are nice for an i d and credit card so this case is perfect for my iphone 3gs,5
4498,the best feature of this charger is that i can charge my ipad 1 and ipad 2 off of it,5
4499,the holster is the right size for my car and has a cool blue light that adds a nice glow to the car interior,5
4500,i take this one with me when i travel and use in rental cars,5
4501,high build quality tight usb ports dont have to worry about the headset buds falling out while im talking,5
4502,i use it all the time and it has a great battery life and the price is right,5
4503,considering how many times i end up with a dead phone on the way home through traffic,5
4504,easy in and out of your pocket this would be a good choice for an inexpensive iphone on prepaid,5
4505,i purchased this for my iphone 5 and it works like a charm,5
4506,it was easy to pair with my phone so that i can listen to my music even when i'm not at my desk,5
4507,it also comes with a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen,5
4508,clearly its a cheap purchase but ive been using it for almost a month i can say a few words about this battery,5
4509,i have been using for some time and other than that it doesn't fit very well in my pocket due to size,5
4510,i've dropped it a few times and the case has held up and i have experienced no loose stones or any other defects,5
4511,this item was being offered at a great price and it works well with the phone,5
4512,several of my son's friends like the case so much that i ordered another one in a different color,5
4513,i have dropped my phone a couple times with this case and it has yet to give me any issues,5
4514,it no longer feels like it is going to slip out of your hands,5
4515,now what puts this jabra speaker apart from the others is the material used to make the tip,5
4516,it dries evenly and best of all it does not collect dirt like those cheap one out there on the market,5
4517,the power button is recessed so it 8217s easy to toss in a bag without a problem,5
4518,the only problem i've found is that it is a bit large and heavy at 4,5
4519,a really nice case that still keeps the phone slim and less like a 34 brick 34,5
4520,well with the imp99d igeek battery pack you don't have to be near a wall plug or in a cruiser,5
4521,bought this for my old iphone so i knew i wouldn't have a problem recommending this to anyone with multiple modern usb devices,5
4522,it is a little bulky but a small price to pay for such convenience of not needing to charge it so often,5
4523,i have gone through several blue tooth earpieces over the years and this one for the note 3 is great,5
4524,the installation process is pretty easy but make sure to take your time and match it up right,5
4525,i love how it folds up and makes it easy to carry the things that are important,5
4526,charging the speaker requires you to either plug the usb cable into your computer into the juicpack for it to charge,5
4527,i own several cases for my phone and this screen protector does the trick i love it,5
4528,trust me if you get this case you will love it it's beautiful and so pretty,5
4529,this is fixable by placing your index finger on the top of the phone where many users think is its rightful place,5
4530,the nt120 t has a rectangle surface and is about the size of a deck of cards but about a quarter inch thicker,5
4531,this became a problem because in my state just passed a no cell phone talking while driving except with bluetooth or speakers,5
4532,i used to use my htc charger that came with my phone and these did the job very well,5
4533,the blue is rubber and the black is a hard case around the middle with a metallic finish,5
4534,i also like the blue light that makes it easy to find the correct cord for the device when you have several,5
4535,it has 5v 12v 16v and 19v output so i can charge my iphone and my ipad at the same time,5
4536,the audio cord is thin and i don't know how i ever did without this,5
4537,i had pretty much this exact case for my galaxy s3 and never had a problem either,5
4538,the stick on screen protector is nice too was able to put it on without any bubbles or anything like that,5
4539,i was very careful to clean the screen of any smudges or prints completely along with any dust,5
4540,the price is unbeatable very cheap but the case doesn't look cheap although the price is very reasonable and affordable,5
4541,i got this phone for the simple fact that i was able to drop in power up and log on in just minutes,5
4542,with a 2200mah battery pack i was concerned that the bulk added to the phone the phone is no longer recognizable,5
4543,i've been using this charger for a couple of months now and only use it as a car charger,5
4544,one thing i like about this headset is that i can listen to music in the shower and this was a no brained,5
4545,i received this battery as a review sample and out of the box it was synched and ready to use within two minutes,5
4546,i've had it for a few months and have had no issues at all,5
4547,i put one of these on my wife's phone and it is light thin and durable,5
4548,my friend gave me this external battery pack and i liked it so much i purchased another one for the other car,5
4549,they say design is subjective but i really like the shape and smooth feel of this phone,5
4550,i have always purchased the plastic screen protectors in the past and have personally found them to be a nuisance,5
4551,love this case i get a ton of compliments on the pink one,5
4552,love this case it's very feminine and that's what i look for in the compromise between slimness and protection in a case,5
4553,these protectors fit perfectly on the iphone 5 and it doesn't come with a screen protector so buy one when you buy the phone,5
4554,the case is pretty large and made out of very durable plastic and holds the phone well,5
4555,shape and sound are okthe battery is very good and it's one of the safest on the market,5
4556,i would highly recommend purchasing a screen protector to protect your tablet from scuffs scratches and abuse,5
4557,very easy to apply the first time and you don't need to charge more than one or two items,5
4558,this case add's the right amount of grip to the phone without adding much size and it looks good,5
4559,i don't want to end up with a cracked screen and 100 for a phone insurance deductible,5
4560,she has dropped the phone a couple of times it hasn't broken,5
4561,as a compulsive phone-checker this is a great thing to lay out and then toss your phone on it,5
4562,it's small enough to carry around in a purse or attache case,5
4563,its super super super duper duper cute and pink is my favorite color and i have a few blue outfits to match it with,5
4564,i love the quick release functionality i've never had a concern that my device would fly off as i was working out,5
4565,its not that protective though and when i first got it it showed on my phone at 80 %,5
4566,definitely would recommend this case to anybody who wants to protect their phone but still have a nice design and fits perfectly,5
4567,it does add a very very faint grain effect if you're looking for it to do something else move along,5
4568,i love this case it has a texture to it so it doesn't get lost by a rubber connector,5
4569,this is a very well designed case that was very simple to put on my phone and easy to take off,5
4570,it also permits me to use the phone as i do very often but when i do i have no problems with it,5
4571,just finished a 3 day trip and was able to keep my ipad air going without depleting it during the day,5
4572,was looking for a holder for my truck when i am on the road and just one outlet is available,5
4573,but the great thing is you do not have to have the latest and greatest then absolutely get the s4,5
4574,replaced the battery with this one and it works just as good as the otter box but i actually prefer it,5
4575,the top cover part will fold all the way around the phone which helps me to feel secure,5
4576,so this particular charger only a little bigger than a deck of cards or a slim pocket camera,5
4577,the speaker is not heavy but at the same time is much more flexible and pliable,5
4578,it's small enough to carry in my purse when needed,5
4579,i'm so happy with this one i don't think i have had a better screen protector application,5
4580,if you're looking for a case that will protect your phone fairly well for what it is,5
4581,this case came a couple days ago and i now feel like i have a brand new phone and no case,5
4582,if you have any just squeeze and it is very easy to put on and take off but fits the phone perfectly,5
4583,all in all i am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the case to anyone of any age,5
4584,i think i'm going to order another one just to have it cause you cant beat the price,5
4585,i paid nearly 200 for the bt setup in my car and i'm sure many people will enjoy using it too,5
4586,i use it all the time and that's all i need in a bluetooth receiver reliable reception,5
4587,the description had me wondering if it came with a cable or a somewhat built it cable,5
4588,now i can charge my ipad and iphone at the same time with the iclever 3,5
4589,i would recommend this product to everyone in the market for a bluetooth speaker this is the one for you,5
4590,i have to say i am impressed with the quality and the fit,5
4591,i actually like the fact that this case is a perfect fit with feel of quality,5
4592,after a couple months i am very happy with my purchase and i plan to use it every day to charge my power hungry devices,5
4593,it really could be a bit dimmer you don't need to be an origami expert to do so,5
4594,it is easily plugged in and i do not need to use my notebook usb port,5
4595,all in all i would definitely recommend this case for the samsung galaxy s4 also that is even more low profile,5
4596,i got this case a few days ago and so far i am really impressed by it but just not it's bulk,5
4597,it is really nice to be able to have this outside and not worry about it getting damaged or scratched,5
4598,i was skeptical but i now don't need to worry about this anymore,5
4599,have been using the car charger for over a year and it has yet to fail at the suction cup,5
4600,if you have an iphone 5 5s this is a case that i would recommend to anyone looking for a nice looking protective case,5
4601,the fact that it has an open usb port so that you can charge the battery in your car without having to hold it,5
4602,i've had the nt70 t for a few months now and i still have a great battery life,5
4603,it's easy to tell this is a quality product from a known company,5
4604,this works for both my ipad and my iphone and tether the two together,5
4605,there are two schools of thought when it comes to phone cases i only buy cimo if possible,5
4606,the phone fit in perfect and easy to get in and out now but will not fall out on accident,5
4607,i compared the new trent dual usb car charger is a great little device to charge two items,5
4608,the material is leather and it fits my phone like a glove yet still allows me to easily access my phone,5
4609,so while it took a few tries to get the screen protector on better,5
4610,when it arrived i was really pleased with the look of the casing,5
4611,absolutely beautiful loved the way it fit on the phone and the colors of the case match great,5
4612,very happy with this cable it works as it should and the retractable cord is a huge benefit as well,5
4613,my old charger was black and got lost when i dropped it in the toilet that the phone wasn't ruined,5
4614,i give this product a five star and would recommend this to any one that wants to protect there investment,5
4615,it was exactly what i was looking for and does not slip out of your hand,5
4616,i love buying a lot of these because they are cheap and durable and work really well,5
4617,the static screen protector is an added bonus and for the price you really cant go wrong with this one,5
4618,update 7-21-12 i thought i would try to charge it will my sc4000,5
4619,i have to wait a little while to get to me but it was worth it my daughter loves it,5
4620,just double press the power button to turn the flashlight on or off,5
4621,quality across the board seems great though i haven't had the types of problems described in other reviews,5
4622,and we've had it for more than a month or so,5
4623,i paired this film with thediztronic matte back black flexible tpu case for motorola droid bionic 4 g verizon tpu-cases retail packaging,5
4624,unlike the first case i purchased for my iphone 5 close to release day,5
4625,over the last two weeks i've had the opportunity to use the unit a number of times,5
4626,this case is nice fits well and is easy to put on and works perfectly,5
4627,it was as expected and it works great used it to charge my phone with the case on without any issues,5
4628,i switched to this charger and it is able to charge my phone and this makes it well protected,5
4629,but its also good to know that i can throw it in a purse glove box gym bag etc,5
4630,i bought this for my iphone 4 and never had a chance to use it extensively for several days now,5
4631,i am very pleased that i decided to buy this one and the quality is still the same,5
4632,only had it a week or so and it seems to be holding up better than anything else too,5
4633,they are right up there with the best of them and provides a total media experience,5
4634,there's really not much to say other than the fact that it works like it's supposed to,5
4635,this was a good choice for me to keep my phone charged while going out into the woods all day,5
4636,i haven't experienced that at all i don't even feel the extra weight in my purse,5
4637,this in no way interferes with the functionality of the phone and that is why i stayed with them for this one,5
4638,just rotate the cap on the charger to reveal a full-sized usb port so you can plug in your own cable,5
4639,high quality just like the originals and charge at the same speed as the apple ac adapter plugged in the wall,5
4640,this screen protector was very simple to put on my phone and it looks cut with all of them,5
4641,i love the tight fit and i have no worries of it flying around while i drive,5
4642,i have dropped my phone from hip level a few times and the case hasn't come off and my phone is fine,5
4643,the front lip of the case is raised enough so you can lay it down and not worry about scratching the screen,5
4644,it's not very bright but it's great when you need a little light and the availability of more power for your phone,5
4645,it seems to charge faster and it doesn't take up too much space in a laptop,5
4646,i bought this for my wife she has had it several months and it hasn't stretched out one bit,5
4647,but for a free phone with plan this is one of the best screen protector with good price,5
4648,the only draw back is that the power button and volume rocker all have a nice feel to them,5
4649,this phone case protects your phone while adding very little to the size of the phone or the armband itself,5
4650,this pen works really well and gives you the option to customize your tunz with three choices,5
4651,so while this isn't a necessity if you have an iphone 4 4s 5 5c this will make your phone hot,5
4652,i can't think of anything negative about it if your looking for a thin protective case this is the case for you,5
4653,the reason is that it would be nice if there was a 9v or 12v rapid charge plug as well,5
4654,i received this case in less than a week and was very well packed,5
4655,if you have a case that covers the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4 g tower,5
4656,for the price and size of the unit i have yet to see a qi charger that has a vertical design,5
4657,i especially love the texture of this case and how it covers the edges of the phone the entire back and camera lens is exposed,5
4658,so bottom line is that i do like the product and have continued to use it,5
4659,a must buy accessory for the atrix if you want to keep it that way you had to run without a case,5
4660,gets annoying and worst is when you forget to charge a device before class,5
4661,i used the volume control on the phone which is a good and bad,5
4662,just keep it charged every month toss it in the car and it sounded fantastic without any echo or artificial sounds,5
4663,i know have the iphone 5 but when i had the iphone 4s so i ordered this one,5
4664,i have been using this for a couple of weeks and love it,5
4665,this is the oem charger that came with the phone fits perfectly,5
4666,you can also wear them under the ear or over the ear or in the ear device,5
4667,no problems with it and i am very pleased so far,5
4668,i mean 50 just so you can put your phone screen down without anything hitting the screen,5
4669,i needed a cover that wasn't as bulky as the otter box commuter series which i swear by their products,5
4670,phone snaps in nice and snug and it's not hard to get it out,5
4671,so i received the phone and the first thing i did was pop off that screen protector,5
4672,it is super easy to put on and protects my phone,5
4673,it is perfect for my cell phone and my tablet at the same time,5
4674,this adapter is good but it doesn't work with my brand new vehicle dock thats okay,5
4675,it's plastic with some metal but overall it does not feel like it is even on the phone the best test,5
4676,the dual usb car chargers are a must have for anyone for a cell phone these days,5
4677,i can connect these headphones even different bluetooth devices at the same time so having two ports is perfect,5
4678,it's a really useful device and would recommend it to anyone looking for extra ports in an older vehicle,5
4679,after a year of use though i notice the charge seems to last a month or more will charge droids iphones and tablets,5
4680,this is also apple certified so i do not have to sit next to a power outlet,5
4681,so i am buying another m50 right now because it is without a doubt the strongest case i have ever had and fits perfect,5
4682,it is beautiful i get a lot of compliments on how pretty it is,5
4683,very pleased with this phone i bought it for my son because he's always losing them,5
4684,this is due to the fact that i do not need to replace the back cover of my motorola atrix and it fits perfect,5
4685,honestly this is a great cover bought it for my girlfriend and already saved her phone multiple times,5
4686,i will be buying another in order to hook it up to my laptop when im watching youtube vids,5
4687,this cover is great i've dropped my phone once or twice and barley adds any size to it,5
4688,it easily cut through the ambient shower noise and i was able to enjoy the clear sound and great bluetooth connection,5
4689,i find the screen size a definite positive it makes surfing the web and watching movies a joy on the giant vivid screen,5
4690,speaking from experience you simply won't find a better product for the price,5
4691,i like this little case for when i go out and don't want to worry about running down my battery,5
4692,all of the cutouts are perfect and the volume and power buttons are equally easy to use,5
4693,i took a few photos with it and i was very impressed with how easy it found my network and connected to it,5
4694,for those otterbox like cases i'd say this is the perfect case for a guy bc is simple but also nice,5
4695,i've managed to drop my phone several times since i got it and it still works and it's perfect for travel,5
4696,it's a great case that allows access to all the buttons and looks very good while doing it,5
4697,the iphone charged at about 1 % per minute for an iphone 5,5
4698,a few buddies had this case so i decided to get the same case for this phone,5
4699,the pack is approximately the same size as an iphone 5,5
4700,the price is right and this is the only adapter that i could find with a longer cord,5
4701,the screen protector fits the samsung galaxy s3 perfectly and does not add any bulk to the device,5
4702,the charger's two ports are labeled 34 tablet smartphone 34 and the bottom is labeled 34 ipad smartphone,5
4703,getting a screen protector on it isn't the easiest thing in the world to get back off once it's on there,5
4704,i like this case because it fits the phone perfectly and have been a great addition to my life,5
4705,considering another brand's model broke apart the first time i tried to connect this screen to my ipod 3rd generation,5
4706,elegant design sleek and compact wireless charger about the size of a dual port one but it offers three ports,5
4707,it actually fits perfectly and i would recommend this case to anyone who likes some bling in their lives,5
4708,my son uses this when he runs and it fits his phone well and is lightweight and easy to push all buttons,5
4709,i work in an office most of the time and this case works well for that,5
4710,it's very cheap and useful to protect the screen of the smartphone and to carry it around,5
4711,i don 8217 t have to spend a lot of time on the couch with her many many hours,5
4712,works great in my car works great with my iphone 5s i don't even have to look to find it,5
4713,this unit is constructed so you don't need a screen protector it's all built into the case,5
4714,it's not bulky and has nice textured grip so it won't slip out of sweaty or wet hands,5
4715,it's very small small enough to charge my phone in my pocket with my knife and the protector got all scratched up,5
4716,i use it a lot since i don't like to take my phone out of this case as i need it to,5
4717,i don't know but i wanted to be able to charge both my ipad and iphone at the same time,5
4718,this is by far the best case i've found so far for the nexus 5,5
4719,personally i prefer a headset where the microphone is closer to my mouth so i don't have to keep plugging and unplugging cables,5
4720,with the charging dock you just lay the phone on it and let it do its job,5
4721,it is very reliable and the fact that the company was quick to replace it,5
4722,both sold for under 15 at the time of writing this review that is a steal imo,5
4723,i got one for my galaxy s4 and i liked it so much i bought enough for my other vehicles,5
4724,i also noticed that the back of the case can sometimes make it hard to see the screen clearly,5
4725,i'm thinking about getting another one because it's very handy when you can't find an outlet or are sitting on a plane,5
4726,you just fold the wallet around the back and you can use the phone while the charger is plugged in,5
4727,this is a simple case that is much better than the belt clip on the kraken,5
4728,they are all substantial cords that inspire confidence and i have had no trouble with it always getting a charge going,5
4729,not to mention it glows in the dark which makes it easier for me to use my ipad 3 while keeping it plugged in,5
4730,i can fully charge my battery from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour so it's pretty fast,5
4731,granted there is not heavy use but the phone has been on for 6 hours and is still at full charge,5
4732,i ran this as a sole source battery charger for my iphone 5 and this is still one of my top 3,5
4733,color it look great i will be buying another one for my 2 daughters next birthdays,5
4734,excellent fit unlike many other cases there is plenty of room for give so the wires are not too crowded,5
4735,that is being very critical so i give it five stars because it's exactly what you need to get,5
4736,the picture is crystal clear and we haven't had a problem with fingerprints or air bubbles on any of them yet,5
4737,extremely useful his battery is a very good value for the price plus great costumer service on top of it,5
4738,got the product tonight installed on my iphone 5 and it looks pretty much exactly how it does in the picture,5
4739,i've had it for a long time now and it has held up wonderfully,5
4740,i am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend purchasing it to my friends,5
4741,the best part is being able to charge two devices at one time,5
4742,easy to follow directions and doesn't take up much space so it looks nice on a desk,5
4743,it will last as long as the screen protector is not too thick or too thing,5
4744,my wife really loved this cover but the only thing is that the volume is slightly muted with the case on,5
4745,i bought it as a present for my mom she loves it she loves minnie mouse,5
4746,this is the nicest portable stand in this price range that i've heard in stores wasn't what i wanted,5
4747,out of all the cases i bought for my iphone 4 with my new iphone 5c,5
4748,im happy with the case and it does not bother me one bit,5
4749,this is most definately the best tpu case for the iphone 5 that has ample capacity for around two charges,5
4750,for my needs this is the absolute best case i have ever had on my phone,5
4751,peel and stick application no cutting required does not interfere with touch screen and touch sensitivity on the device,5
4752,at this price and since it seems to be holding a much better charge than my stock battery,5
4753,the power switch is in the back of the phone and you can't even tell the protector is even on the screen,5
4754,this energizer charger is one of the best i've used,5
4755,i have lots of chargers but this is the one i have on my phone most often,5
4756,it has a minimal lip that covers the edges of the phone the entire back and camera lens is exposed,5
4757,it works better is 1 2 the price of an apple branded wired iphone 5 charger you get a wireless charger,5
4758,update 1 may 10th 2013 so i have had this case for 6 months or so and it still looks great,5
4759,the built in screen protector is perfect and works great with the touch of my finger ormy stylus,5
4760,this was for my friend and he loves it as well,5
4761,aside from that this is the best case i've ever had hands down,5
4762,just hit the speaker button and i can talk while i'm riding down the highway with my convertible top down,5
4763,no issues so far and i dont think i will ever upgrade from this phone,5
4764,audio to user's ear is not as clear as i'd like it to be it was a great mount,5
4765,the headset came fully charged but comes with a micro usb cable and it carries an led flashlight onboard,5
4766,with this 10 foot cable you can conveniently use your device while it is charging and not be pulling on my lap top,5
4767,it's a little hard to press the power button but you can get used to it and it is a comfortable feel,5
4768,one of my favorite things is i can lay the phone flat down and my glass face does not get scratched,5
4769,i have owned several cases and so far this is the best sounding speaker that i have had bluetooth or otherwise,5
4770,i ordered this device to spare me having to fumble around to find my phone when it rings or when i need it,5
4771,the stickiness of the surface that holds the phone in place is a little loose and imperfectly measured,5
4772,i love this case it's sleek and the buttons are easy to feel use without looking at them,5
4773,there's not a lot to say about an iphone charger but it works very well and charges my phones fast,5
4774,i'll go straight to this when i upgrade to the galaxy s4 i can find something like this for it,5
4775,its a little worn out right about now but it does what it is designed to do and does it well,5
4776,i bought the version of this case for the iphone 5 is functional and good looking,5
4777,if you drop your phone with this case on that's this only thing i don't like is the stand,5
4778,it's not like it would be without it but it's not a bright orange as is represented in the product photos,5
4779,what's really nice is that if you don't use the original cable that came with the phone but then anything can happen right,5
4780,its cable length is shorter than the original oem cable that came with my galaxy s3 and his galaxy note 2 the quality is great,5
4781,we have been using this for over a year now and love it so much that i bought a 2nd one for my wife,5
4782,with that said i still bought this phone to see if it was paired to determine its power state,5
4783,good product this is my second one thought i'd lost the first then found it of course,5
4784,i've only been using it for a few days but it has been working great,5
4785,the holster style belt broke in august and now i have to buy new ones but they still work,5
4786,5 stars for quality and looks but if your looking for a compass i wouldn't depend on this one,5
4787,the name nokia itself gives you the assurance that the phone has to be on the cradle at all times to get signal,5
4788,great cover fits great very soft finish the color is the same in the picture and it came in a considerable amount of time,5
4789,works very well seems to be built well and love the way it lights up blue when charging,5
4790,like the slot features so that i don't have to repeat myself because i am heard,5
4791,i've owned several different bluetooth headsets over the years and this one by far is the most impressive screen protector i've ever used,5
4792,if you want to be able to end answer calls with the button on the headset and talk fine without taking out the phone,5
4793,didnt get dirty or worn and i've had it on the insurance plan since day one,5
4794,the touchscreen keyboard on the htc evo v 4 g which wasn't bad,5
4795,it keeps my samsung galaxy note 2 charged when i plug it into my samsung google galaxy nexus android smart phone,5
4796,after reading the many good reviews i decided to take a chance and purchase a less pricey one,5
4797,firstly i have to say i wasn't sure what to expect as far as number of charges,5
4798,i was surprised by the quality for the price i paid for this stylus is good but i would not pay more than s2,5
4799,i absolutely love this case and i'm certain it will help protect my investment,5
4800,when i got it i was very surprised at the quality of the part being so up to parr,5
4801,with this sim card around i don't have to think about damaging the product because of the durable case,5
4802,wasn't expecting anything great for the price but it is a good quality product and i will recommend it to all my friends,5
4803,i will recommend these to other people and i will be buying more for my ipad and the wife's iphone 5,5
4804,not many games work with it and to be honest i have only tested this for several hours at once between charging,5
4805,i have used this case for about 6 months now and i have zero complaints about its use,5
4806,i have been using it for over a month and still holding up strong,5
4807,there was no need to use a credit card to push any air bubbles to the side and then you have it,5
4808,go ahead and stop reading all these reviews if you're looking for a usb power source in your vehicle,5
4809,this qi charger works as described and i have had a lot of them,5
4810,i have not had any problems and it charges my ipad and iphone at the same time and it saves me space in my outlets,5
4811,kidding on the last one i would completely recommend this phone and even service from at t,5
4812,the calls are clear and i recommend it to anyone looking for new powerful smartphone,5
4813,for her birthday i ordered this case for her iphone and used it for quite a while,5
4814,the blueant has the annoying flashing blue light to let you know it is plugged in and working,5
4815,they are good to have if you have a cell phone,5
4816,it fits the phone perfectly and have been a great addition to the rest of the powermat products we have,5
4817,it has two usb ports for charging two devices at the same time but the work around is actually not bad for me,5
4818,the incipio dual pro for iphone 5 is a great choice if you need an extended battery,5
4819,and it's small enough to bring along in the car and i've used it in the uk in ghana,5
4820,it has a heartier miniusb plug than the original at t charger sync cable and not 40,5
4821,it shows the true color of the back of my phone and with the case on it still syncs just fine to the cloud,5
4822,just be sure to use the blue thing that comes with it is a plus letting me watch youtube etc,5
4823,i am using this cable with my samsung epic 4 g touch samsung galaxys ii,5
4824,i remembered i had this backup battery i plugged it in and it started charging as it was supposed to,5
4825,if the edge meets the side of the case it makes it easier to carry,5
4826,looks cool in the car with the blue led light that lets you know when it's connected battery is dying calls etc,5
4827,the glass is gorilla glass supposed to be scratch resistant i'll probably take the screen protector off,5
4828,on top of that it can also be plugged into the usb wall plugs,5
4829,plus the screen protector that came with the phone i keep it home,5
4830,despite the fact i've had it on my phone for a week or so,5
4831,however i'm giving it 5 because it's way better than the cheap 5 tpu cases found on ebay,5
4832,just remember to install it right before you go to bed so it can cure over night,5
4833,just keep it charged every month toss it in the car and it sounded fantastic without any echo or artificial sounds,5
4834,i have had this case on my phone for about a month or two now and i must say that the battery life is remarkable,5
4835,the aukey dual usb car charger is one of the highest quality phone cases i have ever purchased,5
4836,i bought this for my moto g and it was very easy to put my phone into it and take off,5
4837,fits like a glove good design just got it today and i love it fits perfect on my phone,5
4838,i have to take off my case so i can charge my phone without having to plug it in anymore,5
4839,used this cable to charge both my samsung galaxy s4 and my collection of old ipods in both our vehicles,5
4840,the output goes to 2 usb ports so i can charge my iphone ipad blackberry and kindle all at the same time,5
4841,it fits great looks great and is easy to remove and put on fast,5
4842,i've been using this for the past year and i'm starting out caseless with the maxx,5
4843,the only issue i've had is if you have a case on your phone but also having protection when you carry it around,5
4844,i've had this for a little while now with several devices and i have to say that nothing compares to ballisctic,5
4845,the price is right and this is the only adapter that i could find with a longer cord,5
4846,this replaces my sprint htc evo 4 g lte and it charges fast,5
4847,of course it takes about 20 hours to charge it back up using a standard wall charger,5
4848,in fact i loved this case so much i had to buy another one because i'm tired of the color that i got,5
4849,the only issue i have with it is that it has a blue light illuminated to let you know it is in and working properly,5
4850,update 11 2011its probably been a year now and it is the best car charger i've used,5
4851,thanks so much i love the price of the case and i love it,5
4852,i have been looking for a charger that charges more than one device at at a time,5
4853,a great buy and a must have if you want to protect your iphone,5
4854,i have found my battery life to be better on the s4 compared to the note 3 and this cable worked perfectly,5
4855,at first i was skeptical but turned out to be a perfect birthday present for my best girlfriend,5
4856,but all in all this is one of the best purchases i have ever made for my cell phones,5
4857,if i have appointments it looks ahead to see if i need to address an immediate text email sms concern,5
4858,so far it has held up as good if not better than the gorilla glass on the phone,5
4859,also the back is made of a hard plastic and fits the phone perfectly,5
4860,i've tried several screen protectors this is the best i've used on a smartphone hands down,5
4861,these are very clear they do attract finger prints but i haven't seen a single scratch show up on my screen protector,5
4862,the case feels like it will stand up to a lot of abuse and honestly i recommend them to all my friends,5
4863,i'm very pleased with this case and would highly recommend purchasing it to my friends,5
4864,i have had this charger for a few months now and it charges my phone fast,5
4865,when applied correctly you won't notice it on the screen and it practically lays itself without bubbles,5
4866,phone quality is good as you can use it as a battery back-up powerbank,5
4867,the case creates enough of a lip to allow you to place the phone face down so i would suggest buying a screen cover,5
4868,update 5 26 12 i have been using this battery for a while now and its life is amazing,5
4869,this liner is great i am very pleased with this i ordered one for the same price and same 5 gb limit,5
4870,it allows the phone to slip easily in and out of my pockets feels awesome in the palm of your hand too,5
4871,although this is a 2 layer case it is still thin enough to slide into a front or back pocket,5
4872,since they wanted the price of a new phone to replace the flip i had been using for about 10 years,5
4873,the cover fit great and i was still able to put it to use,5
4874,it's a bit stiffer than the original due to the fact it protects the camera lens,5
4875,i can tell no difference between it and the battery that came with my note 3 and he same capacity,5
4876,also it's very easy to find my phone when i lay ti down some place,5
4877,1 a and they can be used at the same time but the incredicharge has the capability to do it,5
4878,the corners are reinforced to protect the phone and the screen because it has a raised edge,5
4879,i like how small this unit is and how easy it is to take it off the cradle and put it back on,5
4880,yes and we drop the phone every once in a while in the music which i never had with my nokia 6300b,5
4881,the only suggestion i would give is that it would be cool to charge the battery case while charging your phone,5
4882,i've had several bt headsets and this is the best i have used so far,5
4883,looks exactly like the one came with the phone so that's a plus,5
4884,overall i would highly recommend these little pawtec chargers if you're looking for a good value in a bluetooth headphone,5
4885,i hope they last a long time because it's hard to find a product that works this well in this market,5
4886,i give the juice box s1 5 stars for its high capacity reliability good build quality and efficiency,5
4887,not to mention it glows in the dark which makes it easier for me to adjust volume and use other headphone controls when driving,5
4888,the price is right it adds grip to the phone without added bulk very comfortable to hold,5
4889,i've also managed to drop the powerpak extreme a couple of times from about knee hight and the cased protected it,5
4890,very sturdy case it is not an otterbox but it is soooo much more elegant in my hand,5
4891,i ran some tests on it to get an idea of how it will best fit the phone,5
4892,pros has both 2amp and 1amp usb ports so i can charge my iphone when out and about,5
4893,i loved it since the day i put it in the phone and it works,5
4894,it will come off the phone fairly easily but i wouldn't want to think about the chance it would slip out,5
4895,but after about 15 mins of playing around i was able to figure out what i wanted to use it for,5
4896,i recently purchased this item and i must say that it's an attractive case for the phone,5
4897,i had a problem and i contacted them and they sent me a replacement very quickly,5
4898,i would recommend this product to anyone interested in a slim case that also will protect the phone,5
4899,the only draw back is that the power button and volume rocker both are still easily used with this case,5
4900,press your ear piece twice to redial the last number called and adjust the volume all while charging your cell phone,5
4901,9 screen protector is just as described and it is very cute and easy to set,5
4902,it does that well but when i dropped my phone it wasn't scratched at all,5
4903,i usually get about 12 hours before i have to look for a manly version for his iphone now,5
4904,the case looks great and does not add too much bulk to the phone even the 34 slim super slim 34 ones,5
4905,this case exceeds my expectations and i would recommend it to every owner of the s3,5
4906,this phone literally blew me away and i will continue to use only blackberry products for my blackberry phone,5
4907,edit edit i've now been using the case a about a week or so and it's already come in handy several times,5
4908,works with so many devices you just add your own usb cable for your device as this does not include any cables,5
4909,my only knock on the case is it is very difficult to get the protector straight and without dust,5
4910,3 workmanship thinness the stylus itself does appear to be very well made and charges at a pretty fast speed,5
4911,all you need is a usb charging cable and an audio cable for non-bluetooth devices,5
4912,the pawtec mini dual usb charger is a great little device to reinforce safety while you drive,5
4913,i play my ps3 pretty often along with a lot of screen time and it is lasting me 2 days,5
4914,would definitely recommend the product to others as long as you don't intentionally slam it into the pavement,5
4915,it also doesn't rattle around like the oem one i got when i got my phone,5
4916,i have used a handful of car chargers since i'm on the road for a long time or what have you,5
4917,the rubber edges keep the front of the phone from edge to edge and does a really good job,5
4918,on another note i don't really like the feel of the material,5
4919,i tend to drop my phone all the time and it is a great color and style and very cheap,5
4920,it installed easily after viewing the how-to video on their website is very easy to understand,5
4921,i use it every day to charge my ipad mini and iphone 5 so that they both match at all times,5
4922,even though the sabrent only offers mono sound it isn't a big deal he just puts it in his pocket,5
4923,it is a great value when compared to some of the other battery packs charger combos this looks very expensive,5
4924,may be luck but i think it's the best i've tried on,5
4925,it's much easier to get the phone in and out of the belt clip with just the right amount of struggle,5
4926,i work at a phone store and do it all the time so it could have been faster than that,5
4927,however i also wanted a case that was attractive and doesn't look like a case is on when installed,5
4928,but does not add a lot of weight to your phone,5
4929,the cover is rubberized so the phone doesn't slip out of the holster as bad as other people described,5
4930,bonus glue a small magnet on the right-hand side of the charger that little dark spot,5
4931,although it does distort a little at high volume it still takes a lot of work to get it set up right for you,5
4932,i use my phone as an alarm clock but i don't have an exact time but less than an hour,5
4933,this charger works as good as the one that comes with the hideous verizon shell holster combo works really nicely,5
4934,it is made by samsung so it is not one of those ugly mega phone cases i hate,5
4935,i pulled it off charger this am and i have been using it for a couple weeks now,5
4936,i use these pretty hard doing crossfit craziness so i don't think it will totally protect the phone from a serious drop,5
4937,in my opinion this is the best available case for the samsung galaxy s4 also that is even more low profile,5
4938,this gel case was exactly what i wanted and it was a great price 28,5
4939,but anyway this case is so cute and i get so many comments on how realistic it looks,5
4940,it is thick enough to be protective but does not affect the touch screen when i use my finger on the screen,5
4941,0amp claimed to be after reading all the negative reviews of this charger and frankly i'm flummoxed,5
4942,also the camera is the best i've ever seen on a phone or handheld device,5
4943,this case is great protection and extends the battery life of the phone but made it very bulky,5
4944,mostly for looks if you are going to get a case for your phone highly recommend this one,5
4945,it is easy to install and easy to remove if you need to access the battery sim sd card,5
4946,i bought this extended battery and back cover i had purchased,5
4947,its not so tight as to be hard to get off so it will protect it,5
4948,and on the bottom of the dock which helps keep it from sliding around on a hard surface like the commuter will,5
4949,i purchased a pair of these for my father-in-law too he also drives a lot for work,5
4950,i bought the white nexus 4 when it came out and it's easy to see when driving to make sure your charging your phone,5
4951,i've had quiet a few cases for the samsung galaxy s4 and for the price you can hardly beat it,5
4952,over the years since the proliferation of bluetooth headsets i have used a number of stylus's for my ipad 3,5
4953,in between these ports is the micro-usb port for charging the internal battery and a 3,5
4954,with this i can see the time when i'm not using the gps on my phone now and needed a new mount,5
4955,i found it but figured it wouldn't hurt to try a new battery,5
4956,this cable is chunky on the end and does not fit well with otterbox commuter cases or insignio case,5
4957,it's a well fitting hard shell that's easy to put on and lasts a long time of abuse,5
4958,i haven't dropped my phone thank god so i can't attest to the long term viability of this unit,5
4959,can be seen but only at the edges and doesn't interfere with the operation but it is unsightly and irritating,5
4960,that i was able to use the kindle with the power bank attached and recharging at the same time,5
4961,it has caught the attention of many passer byers and it's very easy to wear it all day without discomfort,5
4962,had this for about 13 months now and it still works as if its brand new,5
4963,it also has a micro-usb input port for charging the power bank,5
4964,as if you had a photoshop app i love this phone and i'm so surprised that there are so many negative reviews,5
4965,i occassionally have to use two hands to remove the phone from the case takes a little practice,5
4966,so you won't be able to do that but sure enough it did,5
4967,i think this is probably my favorite case out of all the ones i've had,5
4968,wonderful investment this is a great charger for any phone i'm using it with a otterbox symmetry case no problems,5
4969,i am very pleased with this item as well as the fact that the tip is retractable,5
4970,when not holding cards the back also doubles as a kick stand to prop up the phone,5
4971,bought this to charge a spare battery i bought for my htc inspire 4 g which has a low battery out of the box,5
4972,it fits the note 3 great and even though the back and menu buttons are covered but read just fine through the glass,5
4973,it outputs 720p in my phone not sure if it's a new process or material but i love it,5
4974,compared to other screen protectors this was super easy to apply and is just a great item,5
4975,i made sure that i charged it for 12 hours the first day and the battery went down 30 % 70%remaining,5
4976,i would imagine if i tried putting a case on my phone but the grippers held it securely without slipping,5
4977,i don't use the camera much so i can not comment on that and can only to take their word for it,5
4978,does a good job the case has a slight lip and the phone can be placed face-down,5
4979,if you tear the bag carefully you can use it as a microphone for hands-free calls,5
4980,the battery arrived promptly and it was just a matter of plugging it in and turning it on,5
4981,i always misplace these so it's nice to have something protecting it from getting scratched,5
4982,works great for charging my galaxy nexus and my wife's galaxy s2 occasionally her kindle fire simultaneously with no problems,5
4983,update 2 12 2013 now it has been a few weeks now that i've had the jabra awhile i wanted to update my review,5
4984,i'd never heard of this company before but read a lot of reviews that said the buttons are hard to push,5
4985,this items helps me avoid that and is great because there is no sticky rubber to catch on anything,5
4986,they fit nicely in my purse and don't have to worry about it when it falls,5
4987,the back which has the battery fits well on the phone and the this combination looks like made of each other,5
4988,i am a fan of apple products mostly because i don't have a data plan and didn't want to sign a new contract,5
4989,it comes with two mini stylus pens that plug into the headphone jack power port and mute switch area,5
4990,it is a perfect case which i really like it and i think that it is a solid brand,5
4991,nice protector case it fits just the right size for my galaxy with the body glove,5
4992,not many games work with it and to be honest i have only had occasional trouble with it,5
4993,and you can recharge this charger by either connecting it to a computer or a stand-alone usb charger,5
4994,if you want to use the apple lightning cable it's a simple matter to get the iphone 5 in the case,5
4995,hello i have used tech armor stuff before and like it a lot more than the other 3 wallet cases we have,5
4996,i recently purchased a refurbished htc evo 4 g and i liked it because it's namebrand,5
4997,it's perfect for those days you don't want to carry your wallet or a purse for the the ladies,5
4998,overall my daughter loved it and i like that it is a color so it's easy to spot when i sit my keys down,5
4999,while it does bulk up the slim lines of the phone making it easy to catch on things,5
5000,still despite all my complaints i feel that my phone is fully protected without the case being bulky,5
5001,my son has had this case on his phone for a month now and i have nothing but great things to say about this product,5
5002,its an awsome product just wish it came with more than one screen protector so that was kind of a bonus,5
5003,it can be creaky sometimes but it protects the iphone so i don't have the usb charger cable hanging there,5
5004,it looks perfect and is really easy to put on and take off,5
5005,5 mm aux plug and a usb plug on one end and a regular usb plug on the other,5
5006,these are great batteries i recommend these to anyone who is looking to protect their s3's,5
5007,i wanna try shrinking it to fit the phone but i don't mind because i know cards will not fall out,5
5008,it is thin but yet still protects my phone on the sides with it's padded spring release sides is great,5
5009,i've got to use this mount for a few weeks now and have not had any issues with this protector,5
5010,the one and only downer regarding this phone is the placement of the microsd card inside the battery compartment,5
5011,and it is clear so you can see the apple logo on my black phone through the back of the case,5
5012,thank you we have been trying since dec to find a good case for your phone that fit you business attire,5
5013,this is not the first time i have purchased new trent products before and they are yet to disappoint me,5
5014,if you're looking for a simple case that will protect your phone and have great surface grip,5
5015,the down side is that you don't have to get a new phone lol,5
5016,there are three sizes of ear buds so i was able to find a hip case to accomodate it so i'm good,5
5017,i've used it for about a month now and still looks and feels new,5
5018,thus i ordered this sim cutter from noosy and all i can say is you are only making it harder on yourself later,5
5019,if you want the look and most of the features of a smart phone nor do i like paying 75,5
5020,also some reviewers said that you have to take the case off but it has protected my s4 through so many drops,5
5021,i bought this to use with my new google nexus 7 2013 and i'm pleased with the performance of the external battery instead,5
5022,this is a great case and does a good job keeping your phone charged,5
5023,this battery pack comes with a usb cable that connects to the device to keep it recharged,5
5024,i've been using this cigarette car charger with my iphone 5 for about a year and became tired of its bulkiness,5
5025,it is a beautiful case that is sturdy yet has a great feel to it and also seems to have good drop protection,5
5026,the cord that goes around the back of my ear was a bit much,5
5027,and it covers the back and edges of the phone without blocking any of the connectors or cameras,5
5028,i like the shiny surface and it feels like it is made out of a nice material,5
5029,however i didn't need to do so when i use it with my note 3 it didn't happen again,5
5030,bought it months ago and i'm still using the first one i applied months ago,5
5031,i've tried 3 other cases and this is easily the best cell phone i have ever had,5
5032,nothing fancy but that was not what i was looking for and couldn't beat the price,5
5033,it is clear comfortable and it does what it is supposed to do very well,5
5034,not much to say here these parts do what they are supposed to and not get in our way,5
5035,i've only used this for a couple of weeks and so far so good,5
5036,i've only had it a few days so not sure how long the charge last in terms of hours,5
5037,i would still recommend these though easy to put on and remove covers all the parts of the phone,5
5038,very basic case adds just enough protection to the phone without adding a lot of bulk to the phone,5
5039,the only thing it needs is the ability to charge both the devices up to 100 %,5
5040,its wonderful i fully belive in and support the otter box line it offers really super protection,5
5041,it can charge my phone from 50 % to 100 % in one hour and six minutes,5
5042,this white gets dirty fast but that is to be expected considering how much power it carries,5
5043,it came in the mail weeks before the date i was told so i was very happy,5
5044,i received this high output 3-port car charger as a sample in exchange for my honest opinion of the product,5
5045,love the price and probably the best case i have had so far life proof otterbox and the atlas,5
5046,0 with aptx and enhanced data rate works every bit as well as the more expensive oem from any carrier,5
5047,now i can travel anywhere with my kindle and not have to worry about dropping it on it's front,5
5048,the mirror is way better than a regular protector and is very handy when you want to walk around with your phone,5
5049,repeat the above steps for the front of the phone makes the screen look a little small relative to the phone,5
5050,it comes with it's own screen protector which i did not use but it was a nice touch,5
5051,1 amp port so you can charge your phone while using this cable,5
5052,i brought this product for myself it came on time and it was just as it appears in the picture,5
5053,oh did i mention that this is the best case i've found for the s3,5
5054,i bought at least 2 other cases before i got this one and they were all a waste of money,5
5055,however i'm giving it 5 because it's way better than the 15 and 10 ones i bought previously,5
5056,i've had this for several weeks now and it is working quite well,5
5057,in my opinion this really is a must have for anyone that has a smart phone or tablet,5
5058,yes there's now an otterbox prefix case for the samsung galaxy s4 fit really well im happy with this purchase,5
5059,if you are looking for good quality bluetooth earbuds which are easy to use and provide solid tactile clicks when pressed,5
5060,i also purchased one for my galaxy note 2 and im very pleased with the product,5
5061,not even the face of the phone because it seems to be exactly what they are looking for,5
5062,works well and i'm glad i got it it looks like it's going to be a life saver,5
5063,i need it to slip into my pocket and i don't find it difficult at all,5
5064,the charger is very compact albeit a little heavy but that is to be expected with such a high capacity battery,5
5065,elago makes some of the best cases for the samsung galaxy note 2 i thought why not try this again,5
5066,it's a fairly tight fit feels good in my hand and has plenty of processing power to spare,5
5067,case has a really neat and clean look like it's made of quality material and holds up well protecting my iphone,5
5068,external batteries are essential for people on-the-go and i can tell you about my experiences with it,5
5069,overall i'm very pleased with this cord and would recommend it to anyone looking for a screen protector for their iphone,5
5070,seems to provide just as much protection as the otterbox but it does enough,5
5071,fits my epic touch perfect and love the grip it has on my phone i do not get tired of it,5
5072,this case is a very slim case that fits nicely in my hand and also is easy to carry along with other devices,5
5073,phone supposedly won't be able to access t-mobile's 3 g 4 g networks,5
5074,i haven't tried the vent clip but it looks like it might work if i played with it for a while,5
5075,the grips work well and i have only had it for a week and have yet to charge it,5
5076,i just recieved my ismooth screen protectors today and i can honestly say that the adhesion went very very well no bubbles anywhere,5
5077,the included battery is samsung original equipment appears to be identical to the charger that was bundled with my motorola droid x,5
5078,i use it in my car on a daily basis and i highly recommend it for all three you can not beat the price,5
5079,my advise would be to just get in the habit of making sure i did not loose my phone,5
5080,i have not dropped my phone so i can't really say that about my other chargers whether oem or generic,5
5081,when it arrived my wife was impressed with the quality and felt that it was a great value,5
5082,i absolutely loved it and got so many compliments on it because of the different colors and design,5
5083,i also love that there is a place for i d and a credit card with me and just have the phone,5
5084,i keep my phone in my pocket and this case does a great job of protecting the screen,5
5085,fit the device perfectly doesn't add too much bulk to the phone and the quality is good as well,5
5086,0 in 367 ppi 2 gb ram microsd up to 64 gb 13 mp 2mp exynos 5 octa 5420 quad-core 1,5
5087,this power pack was enough to keep both my iphone 4s and my iphone 5s as well as an assortment of adapter plugs,5
5088,durable sturdy everything was like the description and it fits like a glove for the price you can't beat this case though,5
5089,it is actually much longer than the adapter that comes with the ipad so big for the ipad vs the iphone,5
5090,the only drawback is that it's a bit hard to move around but still it was worth the price,5
5091,i liked them very much they look and feel of quality and have performed to my expectations,5
5092,identical in every way to the one that came with the sprint palm pre bought on day 1,5
5093,i also like the placement of the power screen on off button on the side of the electron a digital display comes on,5
5094,also great for holding the phone up so that i can use the same cable to charge the device,5
5095,i'm able to power my smartphone several times over and it's a little over the same capacity as an ipad 4,5
5096,i wish belkin made this for my galaxy note 2 it works wonderfully great,5
5097,all of the buttons are functional via the case and it is easy to get the phone in and out before and after running,5
5098,we plugged in both of our cellphones and my kindle fire hd 7 34 tablet and they worked very well,5
5099,the case also provides a good grip and the raised edge around the screen protects the screen when placing phone face down,5
5100,i have been using this phone holder for about 4 months now and all the 34 stones 34 are still in place,5
5101,the device has 4 led lights to indicate the amount of charge remaining,5
5102,to make this case even more desirable is that it is made in the usa really a high end screen protector,5
5103,i have a lumia 1520 which is almost the size of a cell phone this beauty packs a ton of recharging power,5
5104,was dirt cheap and did exactly what i needed it to do show off the color of my phone perfectly,5
5105,the case is very easy to install and stays on tight,5
5106,after spending several hours using the headset i was very pleased with the overall construction especially the kickstand and the fit,5
5107,it gives my phone maximum protection with out being bulky like some other cases i have had,5
5108,i gave a 5 on comfort the only thing that is not is the cut out for the bottom 3,5
5109,when i received my free sample for review i plugged it in to charge and it was completely charged again within two hours,5
5110,i carry at least on in my car and in my home i am quite impressed with this one,5
5111,second the rubber mounting at the bottom will get in the way of things depending on where the plug is located,5
5112,the system doubles the battery capacity so you can listen to your music library while you do dishes,5
5113,would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dual usb charger that outputs 2,5
5114,the front sticks up about a millimeter from the face of the phone which gives it an additional layer of protection,5
5115,pros fit design material protection pricecons case makes it a little more difficult to plug in things but it's not a huge loss,5
5116,but the long and short of it is that this case is very difficult to remove once you place it on your phone,5
5117,the price would not seem to indicate that it's a very high quality headset and i'm very satisfied overall with it,5
5118,that means you can slip it in your back pocket anymore but if you drop it it will be very protected,5
5119,it has a bright flashlight and is compact enough to carry around in my jeans pocket even the tight ones,5
5120,i rarely use flash so it's not a problem for me but others may find this annoying,5
5121,many people will already have a couple of these lying around the house if you have any apple products,5
5122,i used the cable to charge my kindle fire and htc evo 3d phone,5
5123,feels like a phone feels nice in my hand and it's a lot better than it says it is,5
5124,it is just like apples cord that you get with the phone so it doesn't scream phone,5
5125,retention in the ear also appears to be much better than the one the phone came with,5
5126,but it is easy to change the look of the device with minimal effort,5
5127,if you ever find that you don't have a good grip on it which helps in not dropping it,5
5128,i bought these for my daughter's phone and she couldn't even tell it was refurbished,5
5129,case crown makes awesome cases and this one is pretty cool i don't think i've dropped my phone since i got it,5
5130,i have been using this screen protector for a few weeks now and i still forget,5
5131,i will often carry my phone in my back pocket a lot and this case is prefect designed to fit your iphone 4 or 4s,5
5132,i did end up with a small bubble that i can't seem to get facebook to pull into the menu,5
5133,the switch on the left lets you turn the power on or off without removing your iphone from the enclosure,5
5134,ill post some photos for those that want to see what it looks like without them before cutting off their own,5
5135,i tracked this order coming out of china and it took a while but i love iti recommend anyone with iphone to purchase,5
5136,love that has a red light that turns on to let you know it is plugged in and working as well,5
5137,it maintains an excellent charging capacity so that you can use your phone as long as you can,5
5138,for 10 dollars i believe it is a very good idea to charge multiple devices at once,5
5139,it's not bulky and has nice textured grip so it won't slip out of sweaty or wet hands,5
5140,i would recommend this case for anyone who wants to show off the beautiful design front and back,5
5141,operation is easy and straightforward 8211 just connect the device you want to charge if it is not a subminiature connector,5
5142,although it comes with a screen protector but i will probably be purchasing a blue one for myself,5
5143,i've had the item for over a week now and i use it every day,5
5144,you don't even notice there is a screen protector on the phone at all,5
5145,now no worries because i can keep two devices plugged in at the same time and the duracell gopower worked great,5
5146,this product did arrive on time and in good condition at a good price,5
5147,i can charge my note 3 and a spare battery at the same time so that will have to go back,5
5148,the only issue was it took a little while to come but that's ok because it comes from china,5
5149,i would like to recommend it to people who want a slim case that is cheap you have found it,5
5150,if you want a case that protects from normal wear and tear and average scuffing while it's in my pocket,5
5151,i recently bought an otterbox defender case for my iphone 3 g and i liked it,5
5152,i just feel it is a little bigger than twice the size of the stock battery which can provide days of powers,5
5153,stand is plastic and feels like it won't last very long just to let you know,5
5154,with the battery pack i don't have to worry about bubbles or the edges peeling,5
5155,however these days either one of them can be used with almost any small electronic device on the market,5
5156,only way to improve it would be to make the button areas more defined,5
5157,i love this product because it works as well as the original one that came with my phone,5
5158,i got these for my husband for christmas and looks like it will protect my phone very well,5
5159,when the speaker is ringing and you do not want to carry a purse with her credit cards and drivers license,5
5160,the k-ble ultra series 10 ft usb data sync and charge cable worked great when charging her ipod,5
5161,this cord matches the color of the charger orange which makes it easy to find when someone forgets where they left it sitting,5
5162,the legs are there just to prevent the phone from falling out of my shorts pocket,5
5163,i've got tech armor matte screen protectors on every one of my devices i feel they are the best to use,5
5164,because it charges and runs the phone at the same time but don't have enough outlets,5
5165,works better and last longer than any other shield i have purchased in the past that are flimsy and they come off,5
5166,its held up to weeks of use and it gives the phone a great look without adding too much bulk,5
5167,i couldn't replace the device but i'm glad i didn't because the lg optimus slider is great,5
5168,also comes with the back protectors which i didn't realize when i ordered it but it is actually a 3 pack,5
5169,the bolt is so small that it fits in the palm of my hand it is so easy to use and i have no complaints,5
5170,i'd recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an external battery wireless charger,5
5171,for the most part it is a good case and i would order again from this seller,5
5172,i have installed about a dozen different screen protectors over the years from cheap chinese ebay junk to spendy name brand products,5
5173,i just received the product and it slipped right onto my iphone 5c with a perfect snug fit,5
5174,perfect fit i could not have asked for a better product to protect my new galaxy s5,5
5175,i bought this battery for my samsung galaxy note ii and my i pod touch 4th gen,5
5176,that way you can use the usb cable provided with the apple products i use,5
5177,it provides ample protection for my phone and it's the best case he has had for his iphone 4,5
5178,i love the looks of it and i have dropped my phone 100 times no scratches and no broken screen,5
5179,when i got my dna it was so beautiful that i didn't want to hide the overall design and color,5
5180,i love this case exactly what i was looking for and bought it just from reading the reviews,5
5181,my uncle had a small square red charger so i was looking for something portable and easy for him to carry with him,5
5182,he cleaned the screen thoroughly with the cleaning cloth that comes with it is useful though very small,5
5183,juggling various cables and docks for all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare,5
5184,the powergen is great for me since it has two usb ports obviously you can use the charger for two items,5
5185,i purchased the bluetooth headset and i am so glad i got these they cover around the main button also,5
5186,i originally own a dx 1700 case and i loved it but this suits my physical needs much better,5
5187,my screen never gets dirty it never shows fingerprints and it doesn't show any sign of wanting to fall off,5
5188,if you need just one or two extra charges to get you through the day so why not get one of those,5
5189,5 mm speaker cable to hook it up to my home stereo system too,5
5190,my mom bought this for my cousin and she was totally satisfied with it,5
5191,i dropped my phone millions of times in this case and it's still protected and perfect with absolutely no damage,5
5192,i've had the case for about a month now with no problems so as far as i'm concerned is a good thing,5
5193,found these chargers to be one of the fastest i have seen after testing many chargers,5
5194,if you get it on crooked you can still peel it off and re-apply it which risks stretching dust fingerprints etc,5
5195,i'm using this to charge both my nexus 7 2013 and galaxy s5 with qi wireless charging back,5
5196,i literally never have to plug my phone to charge as i always have a battery that is ready for me,5
5197,the battery is not large the case still fits easily in my pocket and for the added protection it's worth the slightly larger size,5
5198,the light is really bright i wouldn't recommend if you want it to charge a little faster turn off phone screen,5
5199,i highly recommend this brand easy to apply step-by-step instructions for replacing the lcd screen on the droid x,5
5200,i love the stretchy cord but be aware it doesn't slide out of your hand while holding,5
5201,so to put it in a nutshell the battery is small enough to fit in my jean pocket,5
5202,i'm pretty particular and can honestly say that this screen protector is the best for iphone 5,5
5203,people i am talking with tell me that the sound quality on their end sounds distant,5
5204,the suction cup is very strong if you have to remove it often or maybe dropping it a couple of times,5
5205,i actually purchased this to accomodate a galaxy s4 with an otterbox and no issues fitting in the mount,5
5206,with armorsuit military shield i was able to apply the screen protector and it went on very easily,5
5207,i'm pretty sure i am going to get another one for my new iphone 5s now,5
5208,if your phone is in the case you don't have to worry about it slipping off on it's own,5
5209,they are made of soft silicone so you don't have to worry about banging into things,5
5210,also the cases are very durable i have dropped my phone from hip level a few times and the case has not fallen off,5
5211,i purchased several of these adapters so i could have one at home and one at work and you can not beat the price,5
5212,this currently for a slim case which doesn't offer a whole lot of protection but went on the phone nicely,5
5213,the incipio uses a soft-touch material on the hard plastic which makes it easy to slip on the phone,5
5214,the usb ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that i didn't have any problems with this card at all,5
5215,i would recommend it to anyone looking to add just a pop of color to their new phone with a slim fit,5
5216,i owned over 30 cases for my iphone 4 and now for my iphone 5,5
5217,great angle so i can see who is calling before i answer if you sync your address book with it,5
5218,i was very happy to see this case it is exactly the same as the one that was in my phone before,5
5219,i have used several different ear pieces with my iphone 4 and the color is bright a vibrant,5
5220,i took some fine sandpaper placed it flat on a table and not worry about the screen,5
5221,since the battery size is pretty large i just let it charge over night and know exactly where i left it in the car ha,5
5222,besides being a real hassle when you are in an out of wifi area a lot of the time,5
5223,like all screen protectors they can be a little tricky to take off but it's all good,5
5224,they don't come with extra ear buds but the ones that came with the phone which makes them more portable,5
5225,the case is sleek and does not add as much to the size of the phone screen,5
5226,plus the raised molding and black plastic make the phone much easier to hold and the volume power buttons are much more usable,5
5227,cons only thing i could possibly think of would be that the holster belt clip isn't adjustable,5
5228,i previously had an incipio case for 2 years on an iphone 3 g and they were very easy to apply,5
5229,for the price of this case you can't ask for a better way to carry the massive note 3,5
5230,i bought screen protector at best buy a few days after i bought the phone because i do travel,5
5231,the part of the stylus that touches the screen is roughly the size of a wallet it fits in my jeans pocket no problem,5
5232,just got this item opened it and tested it with my ipod touch 4 g kindle fire hd my lg cosmos prepaid phone,5
5233,i bought this for a friend it fits the phone well and she can charge it without taking off the cover,5
5234,this was intended as a stop gap case because it was cheap and had good reviews so i thought i would help at t folks,5
5235,very easy to apply and if you make a mistake you can lift it up and readjust it if need be,5
5236,the charger's two ports are labeled 34 tablet smartphone 34 and bottom usb port is labeled 34 ipad smartphone 34,5
5237,there are 2 belt loops that i don't use and battery life is very satisfactory,5
5238,a to stay objective i would say that this is comparable to the ampen,5
5239,i bought one and loved it so i bought one for my iphone and it protects it like no other case,5
5240,i love it i put it on the charger and it worked as expected,5
5241,as for the size issue it fixed itself after a few days of use it is not scuffed or scratched at all,5
5242,it fits in your hand in a way that makes it such a pleasure to hold,5
5243,this case is a great fit for the samsung galaxys ii is a great way to protect your phone from scratches nicks and dust,5
5244,thin protective from scratches and has a lip on the front side to protect the screen when laying face down,5
5245,it is small and light so at times i forget that i even have a screen protector on because it will be a life saver,5
5246,wanted an extra one so i didn't have to carry 2 with me,5
5247,i would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to carry their purse or wallet when they go out,5
5248,i have an ipad3 and it seems like everything i buy as of late charges via usb,5
5249,i travel a lot and always need a way to charge my phone and itouch when the power goes out or when you are traveling,5
5250,it protects my wifes phone nicely she loves the color and likes the texture of the outer cover in her hand,5
5251,this comes with a 10 inch micro usb cable to charge it and mine did not include the cable,5
5252,i bought this case a few days after i ordered it in the mail,5
5253,this htc travel charger is the perfect replacement if you are looking for a shower speaker than look no further,5
5254,it has rubber around the edges so it protects the screen when laid flat on a table or desk,5
5255,this has been a lifesaver for me and now i don't have cords draping from all outlets,5
5256,i've had this for about a month now i am a believer,5
5257,but according to my husband the real beauty of it is that it can be used with or without a cover,5
5258,this was a gift that was for a person who likes to listen to music or watch videos this case works great,5
5259,there are two minor things that i would like to see it brighter or done away with completely,5
5260,used the anker 5200mah battery for over 2 weeks now and i have to say i am very pleased with the performance of this product,5
5261,it does add some bulk and weight to the phone but for me instead makes it easier to handle,5
5262,unfortunately i could never figure out how to put the phone into the holster top first,5
5263,i think these things worked just fine i haven't had any issues with lockups or related problems,5
5264,the hinge allows you to set your phone face down without worrying about scratches to the glass,5
5265,fits snug on the phone doesn't add too much bulk to the phone is a plus for me,5
5266,the case is four pieces with the holster so you have to make sure it's in place,5
5267,i've been using the case for about a week now and so far so good,5
5268,smooth sailing after that and they turned out to be one of my favorite headsets the extreme gets the 5-star treatment,5
5269,it fits snug on my phone and it's perfect for that because it stays put,5
5270,if he is happy with it then i am happy with this purchase and don't forsee any problems,5
5271,it fits the home button perfectly and it makes it easier to find in a bag compared to say a black battery,5
5272,this is exactly what i was looking for and the price is perfect for protecting your iphone which for me is my life,5
5273,this case is very nice i have a white phone so i wanted to have a double plug setup,5
5274,1a port and one 1a port circuit design with over-heat over-current or over-charge your device,5
5275,this charger is exactly like the original one that came in the box with my iphone 3gs way too short,5
5276,my vehicle has a usb port built in but it doesn't provide enough power to charge most phones about four times over,5
5277,i then had my wife take my phone out of the case and probably bent it too much,5
5278,i bought this case from myself and ended up giving it to my dad and he lost it,5
5279,no complaints as it was inexpensive and does what it says it will i start with five stars,5
5280,the battery could easily charge two iphones at once and i charged an mp3 player on it,5
5281,it fits the phone perfectly and has a nice feel to it and fits the 4s phone well,5
5282,unlike casemate cases it slips on and off easily if you need to get to your phone quick it's in the way,5
5283,it fit perfectly on my screen and does exactly what it says it does for what that's worth,5
5284,i absolutely love this case for my white iphone 4s and it looks fantastic,5
5285,just got this neat toy and can not wait to use it to its fullest potential but it still sounds good,5
5286,to turn on the device you need to press the button to start it charging an attached device,5
5287,it's solid durable and with the flip you can use it as a microphone for hands-free phone calls3,5
5288,although we have not had this one very long but it seems to definitely extend the life of the standard battery,5
5289,my daughter wanted to be able to charge my galaxy s3 phone and to charge my extra external battery packs,5
5290,i would recommend this anker product to anyone who is looking to dress up their phone with a little classy looking bling,5
5291,if you can't tell i'm extremely happy with the quality of the material as i am with this micro cable,5
5292,this case is so cute and i get so many comments on this cover,5
5293,i love this product and would buy it again if i have too,5
5294,case fits my galaxy s4 like a glove and the price was awesome,5
5295,this is a problem because i love to listen to music and play in the back yard,5
5296,i love the extra batteries so i never have to be without a charge when on the go,5
5297,unpacking the liba arrived with a micro-usb cable so i can charge it up with a regular usb that sucks,5
5298,d both holders have a range of 360 rotation to allow you to view your phone in either landscape or portrait view,5
5299,here are the things i like about the phone the phone is a very basic look which i find better,5
5300,for ipad use belkin recommends this charger belkin usb wall charger with 4 ft sync charge cable for my iphone and ipad is wonderful,5
5301,i had originally gotten this item for my new phone but when i found it in purple omg i am ecstatic,5
5302,this is the exact same charger that came with my phone and works the same too,5
5303,easy to get in and out of his pocket he has not complained about it so i guess it is a good buy,5
5304,it fits on my ipad just great and it comes with a cleaning cloth and an installation card for those bubbles,5
5305,this case provides a rim along the screen to protect it when if it falls on the screen side,5
5306,at one full charge this battery is able to charge my iphone to 100 % and my ipad to 68 %,5
5307,my 19 year old daughter loves this case and it protects the phone very very well,5
5308,this is the 3rd cover i bought and i love it and recommend it to anyone,5
5309,it's not as sturdy as i was used to but i am sure that will fade away with time,5
5310,i was able to install this screen protector on my htc one in case i drop it,5
5311,the thing is you really don't have to use this funky universal cable included in the box,5
5312,great charger for 2 devices and i haven't had any problems with lock ups dropped calls or any strange behavor,5
5313,each of these batteries work at least as well as the original battery that came with the phone wasnt long enough,5
5314,if you want the charger cord to be attached to the phone making it bigger and more obtuse,5
5315,the ismooth screen protector is a high quality product for a low low lowwwwwww price this is it,5
5316,typically take these out on runs and have not had any issues using this screen protector with them,5
5317,i have had it for 2 months now and have not had one issue with them at all,5
5318,while the battery does add some bulk to the case but it is justified,5
5319,i was able to charge my note 2 in less than a minute after reading the brief three lines of instructions,5
5320,it does seem like it takes longer to charge but you have to expect that with the capacity of 10000 mah,5
5321,i want to convey to others that this screen protector is a one time one try type of screen protector,5
5322,i've used a few portable batteries but for the most part the note looks remarkably un-changed,5
5323,it comes with two usb ports so you can charge two things at the same time,5
5324,i added a little foam to the bottom of the case but otherwise it looks great,5
5325,i use it to store my bluetooth safely and charge it at the same time and have them charged and ready within an hour,5
5326,it has two usb ports that can power charge three devices at the same time in one location,5
5327,this unit also features fold up wall prongs making it easy to carry in the nice carrying nylon vented bag,5
5328,this is a great solution if you want to take your cable with you,5
5329,the charger is light and small easy to carry in your purse or pocket while you're out clubbing,5
5330,using this dock also allows me to set the phone face down on a flat surface with absolutely no fear of screen contact,5
5331,new openmic technology is very useful so you don't have to worry about fingerprints on the screen,5
5332,i have an google nexus 4 and my wife has an iphone 5s and both work great,5
5333,they're good for that plus the material can be used to clean the battery pack or your ipad or other device screen,5
5334,ismooth also has some of the best customer service i have ever received from any company bar none,5
5335,great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 from virgin mobile and work great,5
5336,that's the other thing i love about this product is that it accepts a tf micro sd card,5
5337,super bright just like i expected it to be but all in all still a great bargain for the price of less than 400,5
5338,worked like it should just as fast as the one that came with the phone,5
5339,i've been using this charger for several weeks now and i am very happy with it,5
5340,this package also includes a coil usb cable with 10 different tips that can be used with that cable mini usb and standard apple,5
5341,for minor drops it can add protection too but if you drop your phone alot but i recommend the case,5
5342,got as a gift when my friend got her first i phone and she loves pink and purple she uses these daily,5
5343,i received the maxboost 15000mah battery pack as a free sample for review the sleek shiny and curvy gadget caught my attention,5
5344,obviously it adds thickness and weight to the phone but not that much,5
5345,my samsung galaxy s3 doesn't have it but i was able to get a discount at the time of purchase,5
5346,i have been purchasing trident cases for every smartphone i've owned and my samsung galaxy note 3 is no exception,5
5347,it's also fun to see people's faces when they see it sitting on my desk at work,5
5348,looks as it does in the picture and it fits my galaxy sii perfectly,5
5349,the device is easy to get out of the case when i was running long story,5
5350,if i had this i would have been able to get a full day of use with no problem,5
5351,chances are your phone or device will be able to charge both smartphones and tablets effectively,5
5352,after getting an android phone i wasn't sure what to expect for a neon purple,5
5353,i have several iphone cases but this is the one that works best for you,5
5354,if you followed all of those steps you shouldn't have any problems finding the right angle for you,5
5355,it does not work loose and is a perfect fit for my samsung note 2 from verizon,5
5356,i haven't dropped my iphone so i don't know how any of the other accessories work,5
5357,at first i didn't like the fact that i had to bring the charger with me,5
5358,never scratches your cell phone and it is so easy to grip so less chance of drops,5
5359,i had to place a qi receiver adapter pad inside the phone to make it work but it already had the needed contacts,5
5360,note i was sent a free sample by the manufacturer in exchange for my evaluation and review of the product,5
5361,for those needing double the power and the ability to charge two devices in parallel with a 2a 1a and one port,5
5362,my experience with this is remarkable and i would recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their iphone 4 screen,5
5363,went on smooth i didn't have any problems with it and it made my phone last all day,5
5364,i have had this mount in my car the last year and a half very quickly but it will still charge them,5
5365,an ac adapter would be nice but for the price i can just order another one or two,5
5366,its got a smooth plastic like texture which i like because it doesn't add any weight to the phone,5
5367,keeps the phone nice and tidy and doesn't cover up the camera and even has a textured back,5
5368,i didn 8217 t test it by dropping the phone but it looks strong enough to take a casual drop,5
5369,it looks as if it will protect my phone if it gets dropped,5
5370,there's a noticeable change in the bass when you hold it in your hand it feels like your holding a actual pen,5
5371,in the last couple months i've had a chance to install it i will update this review,5
5372,the only issue with it is that i have to take it out of the packaging,5
5373,i thought i'd have a problem with it but i don't think i'm going to need to anymore,5
5374,it's not the cheapest but in this case you really do get what you pay foroverall i have become a reluctant apple convert,5
5375,i use my smart phone allot this is a must have device for anyone with a blackberry tour,5
5376,using a credit card to remove the bubbles as you peel the rest of the phone out,5
5377,also the phone can be laid down on it's face without scratching the screen or your screen protector,5
5378,it is very easy to get the phone in and out and work best with phones that are relatively wide,5
5379,i can't tell the difference between these and the much more expensive ones,5
5380,i was able to charge my iphone 5 regardless of the protective cases used,5
5381,it works very well and is a great backup for those times when you're stuck on a long boring conference call,5
5382,i will recommend this to other and i will buy it again when i need to change my current one,5
5383,my main reason to remove it because i have a battery case that i when i anticipate a lot of usage,5
5384,i am going to get a few of these for my wife and i's galaxy note 2's,5
5385,i purchased this as an extra cable to use in the car i really like the way they make the cables,5
5386,its lightweight and does not add bulk to the phone however i have noticed that the soft shell my color is yellow does show discoloration,5
5387,well designed and sleek the case provides excellent protection without adding too much bulk to the size of the phone,5
5388,i used velcro and attached it to the back of the phone but seem to be in the wrong place,5
5389,i would like to add that the on off button and the led indicators will light up displaying how much remains,5
5390,after a couple of weeks i have found this to be one of the nicest looking phones ive ever held in my hand,5
5391,the rubbery feel gives it great grip so that it doesn't slip out of the hand even though its plastic,5
5392,i have bought 4 more just like it in different colors and i love them all,5
5393,i still think it's the best phone out there at this time,5
5394,i have had several short term charging products for my iphone 4 and this is by far the best one currently out there,5
5395,bottomline i wouldn't hesitate recommending this case to anyone who wants the best protection for their devices,5
5396,i highly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a heavy duty case at an affordable price,5
5397,this one stays on is easy to apply and works just as well as the otterbox defender case,5
5398,this is far less bulky and easy to remove so i can swap batteries protects well and looks great,5
5399,i just received this so i don't have a long cord to deal with,5
5400,this is definitely a great device to consider if you are looking at this you are a little cheap like i am,5
5401,they are about five times more thick than the one that came with the phone was only good for maybe a day,5
5402,i bought a few of these for my daughter son-in-law and bought myself a pink one,5
5403,easy to install and definitely worth the peace of mind that your screen is safe from damage,5
5404,its great i really like it keeps the phone thin and light it has a good grip and does the job intended,5
5405,once unboxed the first thing you will notice upon taking it out of the case a big plus,5
5406,also it's very easy to put on as well as take off,5
5407,it protects my phone and i look forward to buying from you all again,5
5408,i've only used it for a week and sold my gs3 bought one for my iphone 5 too and its just so cute,5
5409,a white led serves as a flashlight press and hold the power button for several seconds to power on the headset,5
5410,well that's all i have to say about this case is that it's really big,5
5411,using this pouch for over a week now and all i can say is you are only making it harder on yourself later,5
5412,it is very small and thin which adds no weight to the phone and makes it look really bigger than the original size,5
5413,the best thing about this is that it is a very tight fit,5
5414,i have been very impressed with all the amazonbasics products i've tried have been well made and great bargains,5
5415,the other being thebody glove dimensions satin tpu case for samsung galaxy note 3 again i am 100 % happy buyer,5
5416,even if you have never paired a cell phone with a bluetooth headset not even when i'm driving windows closed,5
5417,this unit works great with my atrix 2 i liked it so much i bought a second one for my office,5
5418,i've used a number of different screen protectors over the years and these were the easiest to install,5
5419,i would definitely buy this again as it does what it says and the headphones are decent as well,5
5420,the case doesn't add much bulk to your phone at all,5
5421,i love the trident aegis case for my samsung galaxy note 3 after ordering it on february 8th,5
5422,i have dropped my phone with the commuter case a couple of times with no issues and even scratches on the case,5
5423,i received a review sample of this product from the manufacturer in return for my honest review of it,5
5424,i may end up getting the clear ones in the future but for now i am happy with the ones i have,5
5425,the button access is great connection opening are good and you have easy access to all the side buttons no problem,5
5426,my husband uses his for working out at the gym and they couldn't take it,5
5427,that i was able to use it for my ps3 but i use it on my phone i find it challenging and extremely uncomfortable,5
5428,its compact shape makes it easy to bring along it looks good and it feels good and is worth every penny,5
5429,i would recommend this to anyone who is trying to protect their smartphone,5
5430,microphone pinhole diameter the little hole on the other side of the room and move all around with my head phones,5
5431,i thought you can plug it into a usb port on a computer or an apple wall plug adapter,5
5432,i've had the case for almost a year now and hers looks like new still,5
5433,yeah i got this case for my mom and she likes it a lot,5
5434,the wall unit got warm but no where near as hot as the apple charger which usually getsuncomfortably hot to touch,5
5435,leds on the front allow you to know when it's fully charged and the box says it wont overcharge the batteries,5
5436,however after putting it to the test it's by far the best screen protector i have ever used,5
5437,the only downside about the commuter is that it doesn't come in the iphone 4 size so that sucks,5
5438,i put it in my backpack and i have not had any problems and it bounces around in my carry on bag,5
5439,this item quickly charges 2 ipads an iphone and a galaxy s3 and s4 and it works fine with each,5
5440,this does a fine job of powering my phone and my wife's phone while we are traveling,5
5441,i am attaching a collage of several photos which can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo,5
5442,purchase for my samsung note 2 and would recommend for those who are looking for capacitive stylus for iphone or android phones tablets,5
5443,i started using elago case a couple of years ago and it fits perfectly,5
5444,it appears that it would do a decent job protecting the phone but be careful it does get dirty easily,5
5445,i can't say that the batteries last any longer than the original samsung battery but does just as well,5
5446,i like my galaxy because of the screen size and is less cumbersome because you don't have to charge the darn thing,5
5447,it is the best case that i've owned for my ipod touch and it is very good and easy to put on,5
5448,this product has 4 led lights that tell you how much power is still left in this bad boy,5
5449,the price is unreal when my friend recommended it i was skeptical because of the low price but this is fantastic,5
5450,my son have been using this for more than a year and it still works well,5
5451,the mesh covering has held up to 6-8 hours a day and this works better than expected,5
5452,i charged my iphone 4s from 20 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half,5
5453,first off these batteries last every bit as long as the original battery before needing to be recharged,5
5454,i also love that its retractable and easy to put in my purse or coat pocket and i found this case,5
5455,this does work just fine and i like the shorter length so i don't have to worry about what port you use,5
5456,she chose the rating just took about 3 weeks to get here but the price and my wife is very happy,5
5457,my husband has been using this for a couple of months now and have had virtually no problems with it,5
5458,my husband enjoys it so he doesn't have to worry about charging my phone every day,5
5459,but soon after having my phone i dropped it a couple times no damage to my device which is always nice,5
5460,i like cases that are both slick and rubbery at the same time and that was kind of difficult but all went well,5
5461,it arrived fast and i am very happy with the service quality and price,5
5462,i would recommend for those wondering if the battery would be a good purchase just by reading the reviews,5
5463,bluetooth setup took seconds in my car and i was able to play music spotify itunes pandora whatever i wanted,5
5464,the only complaint is that the top has a cut out for the earpiece and the front camera,5
5465,it's also not bulky at all and does not get in the way of any of the connections on the phone,5
5466,i have this for a travel phone and don't have to dig around for the stylus in your purse,5
5467,now it is the perfect case for my iphone 5,5
5468,needless to say i really needed a case that wasn't too bulky but still have the protection it needs,5
5469,i ordered a few cases and this one is still holding up strong and we use it very often,5
5470,i love it so much and it looks so good on my white 5s,5
5471,i was skeptical about ordering after reading some of the reviews for this item are being merged from different sellers,5
5472,have only owned for a couple months and will update this review if they replace it with a functioning unit,5
5473,this is my second new trent portable charger and i like it a lot and i have not had any problems,5
5474,if you will be away from an outlet for long periods of time or even at home during a power outage,5
5475,seven months ago in december 2013 i received this as a review unit from ravpower genesis reviewer program,5
5476,now the other great thing i love about this charger is that it holds a lot of power and can power two devices pretty easily,5
5477,the camera is far better than i expected for such a very small speaker,5
5478,i took a few photos with it and i was very impressed with the voice notification features included in this headset,5
5479,i really like that both the top and bottom are open so i have full access to the power button and ports,5
5480,it is grippy enough that you don't feel like you will hurt or drop the phone,5
5481,i've had the item for over a week now and i've found that it works fine on all my devices,5
5482,out of the box after charging the first time you turn it on it will go into pairing mode automatically,5
5483,i love this have had it over a month and it still looks brand new,5
5484,that was an added bonus that i didn't even know i needed until i started using it,5
5485,i cleaned it so it wasn't a big deal and i'm good to go,5
5486,this is not the best case or the best way to protect your investment i think this is it,5
5487,although i paid more to purchase this phone new i am very glad that i made the right choice by buying the aug,5
5488,but i have dropped it a couple of times and it has protected my phone on a couple of drops,5
5489,most people can't tell there is a protector on the phone,5
5490,i would highly recommend this to anyone who uses their phone enough that it needs charging throughout the day,5
5491,case fits perfectly like a glove and does not interfere with my incipio case in the least,5
5492,i work in a hospital and this allows me to keep it on the countertop and enjoy big sound anytime i want,5
5493,i love the led lights which let you know when it's powered and is very light weight,5
5494,i got this primarily to be able to charge my phone and tablet using a single device,5
5495,i have dropped the phone a few times and neither the phone nor the case show the slightest hint of damage,5
5496,however i purchased this cutter for a good price and i got it way ahead of the estimated delivery date,5
5497,shipping was fast would definitely buy from this seller again and also recommend it to my friends,5
5498,well the galaxy note is pretty new so there wasn't much of a choice for covers,5
5499,while it would fit in a pocket it would be a bit bulky but that is not a downfall,5
5500,this was originally purchased as a gift for my mom to protect her phone and it does the job,5
5501,this portapow is the best charging-only cable i've been able to find and i'm a case nut for my phones,5
5502,it is very comfortable in the hand and does not slip,5
5503,i have had multiple people ask me where i bought it and you can not beat the price and the quality is excellent,5
5504,this charger is designed with 4 four usb ports with a total of 8 a that can be used simultaneously,5
5505,i can not say that for every cell phone i've ever owned and at an awesome price,5
5506,the kickstand is a little wobbly but i don't use it die it not being pink,5
5507,for my galaxy nexus it lasts approximately two and a half charges for my phone from a fully charged battery pack,5
5508,after a week of fairly active use i have to say that it is by far the best galaxy gear screen protector on the market,5
5509,it works beautiful and i am glad i was able to get a replacement quickly and this one works well,5
5510,i keep this by the bed so i can use my phone and talk on it while it's charging,5
5511,very slim to the touch and molded to the contours of the phone and now the plug goes in without any resistance,5
5512,the device is sleek light but compact and does exactly what it needs to do and works for me,5
5513,they are well worth the investment and they come with 2 batteries and a wall charger that works on most batteries,5
5514,price was decent application was super easy and it feels good to the touch and does not retstrict touch capabilities,5
5515,i managed to run my laptop for about 5-6 hours a day with no battery issues,5
5516,so no need for me to remove from the case to put the phone in and pull it out at first,5
5517,i highly recommend these to someone looking for a good case for my phone,5
5518,my only wish is that there were a way to attach it to a belt belt loop or clip,5
5519,nice care enjoy using it and it protects my iphone 5 really well too,5
5520,i replace many iphone screens and backs and this product is high quality and is mounted on the right side of the battery,5
5521,the headphone jack opening seems small but it works fine with the stock charging cord and any regular sized headphone jack,5
5522,other than that it certainly cuts down on the number of adapters the traveler needs to carry,5
5523,but it was bulky and it didn't have a scratch on it after more than a year of use still looks great,5
5524,i can gladly say i am impressed with the case i have used it for a fan and light that plugs in with a usb,5
5525,using the charging station itself my phone charged at about the same rate as it charges in the phone itself,5
5526,i had this case in blue and loved it so i got this pretty red for my iphone 5 which is good also,5
5527,i was afraid it would add too much bulk to the phone but seems tough enough to withstand a couple easy falls,5
5528,the color is very bright and makes it easier to find my phone in my dark purse,5
5529,so far only using 1 but liked it so much that i bought a diztronic case for my sgs iii,5
5530,i wish i would have bought this case instead of the ultra thin air in the first place,5
5531,the case has a thick back so the phone won't fit in the dock with this battery and cover attached,5
5532,he was skeptical because i didn't pay much for this item but was pleasantly surprised at how fast it charged it,5
5533,if you are debating between devices this is the best on the market with a bunch of cool features,5
5534,the cover is translucent i have a white phone and it gets pretty dirty,5
5535,i was very satisfied with it that i gave it to my mom to enjoy because i upgraded to the 5c,5
5536,the precision is amazing and gives the phone a great amount of protection without making it too bulky,5
5537,it would be a total pain if i had to take it out of its case when i need to charge at night,5
5538,i did and i got it and i am very happy with it it is secure it fits great,5
5539,it adds very little to the thickness of the phone but it still fits in my pocket great,5
5540,i plugged in the included micro usb charging cable without having to remove my phone from my pocket,5
5541,another welcome improvement the headset detects when it's on your ear it doesn't seem out of place,5
5542,i ordered this case as a gift for my wife's htc one and my gs3 into the 2 ports,5
5543,i like it and use it all the time when i'm home,5
5544,i was about to get rid of my iphone for a new one so i checked with amazon and found this one,5
5545,the cable also transfers data so if you want to connect to the internet or use it with a plan,5
5546,the only negative that i've found is that it is a bit scratchy when i wear it directly against my skin,5
5547,what's the point of purchasing a white iphone if you're just going to use a massive phone case to cover the beauty,5
5548,although it added almost no bulk it doesn't offer a ton of protection but we knew that going in,5
5549,the rubbery material is thick enough to protect your phone from those unexpected drops and bumps,5
5550,the sound quality through the headphones are amazing and now i don't have to have it on the highest setting,5
5551,it has two usb ports and a micro usb input port for charging and a led flashlight,5
5552,it is a perfect fit and it looks really good on my phone and i am very pleased with it thank you very much rene,5
5553,it has 3 different colored plates that can be attached to the windshield or to the dashboard,5
5554,my tablet has android ics and i thought it was great quality until the flower fell off,5
5555,i upgraded from the galaxy s3 and i am very pleased with the product and will use again,5
5556,if i'm hanging out at the water i really don't want to get the case or the phone covered in paint,5
5557,one size fits all and it's easy to take in and out to change extra batteries,5
5558,i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review,5
5559,really easy to apply and you get 3 screen protectors which is a bargain,5
5560,unless you were shipped a defective product there is no reason to spend more for a name brand,5
5561,you can't ask for much more when it comes to protecting your iphone it's otter all the way,5
5562,they didn't seem to hold a charge for more than 2 hours at a time,5
5563,first charge the battery with the supplied micro-usb cable to charge your headset instead of the proprietary one that comes with it,5
5564,no bubbles or imperfections aduro products are of the highest quality right down to their packaging,5
5565,this case is still slim enough that i can still put it in take it out without much difficulties,5
5566,this was the perfect length and was exactly what i was looking for something that would charge multiple devices and this fits the bill,5
5567,happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who would like to try it,5
5568,note i received a free sample from the manufacturer for review purposes i no longer have to worry about that,5
5569,it is hands-down the best car charger i have ever purchased and so far it works great,5
5570,it attaches to the back of the phone and fits perfectly,5
5571,i would definitely recommend this screen protector and i will never buy any other protector for any of my devices,5
5572,i only wish there was a bigger pack so i didn't have to wear the card around my neck,5
5573,nice simple case have had it for several months and it still looks new,5
5574,the impact weirdly leaves a little room between the side of the screen and cover more or less the full panel,5
5575,what i like about the case is that it is a perfect fit with the seidio dilex holster,5
5576,i am enjoying this phone cover even though it is a little flimsy the kickstand stick works well,5
5577,it got here way before it was supposed to and the color is perfect,5
5578,i watch a lot of video on it so i have to charge it more often it would become a hassle,5
5579,works well looks good and i would recommend this case over any other for galaxy note 3 owners,5
5580,it is easy to put on as the phone fits into the case perfectly with this tempered glass on,5
5581,noooo they aren't high-end headphones but i was pleasantly surprised at how well this still holds a charge after all this time,5
5582,this dual usb wall charger is made for power users on the go with few places to plug in,5
5583,shipped on time wonderful construction fits so snug and for the price you cant beat amazon for items like this,5
5584,i was not sure about this case when i purchased it for my samsung galaxy note 2,5
5585,i like this one because it is long enough that i can continue to use my ipad in a normal manner,5
5586,ultimately i decided on the s3 and i am in love with my new galaxy gear wearable,5
5587,while i just got the case and i love it it came quick and it looks so nice on my phone,5
5588,this is the third case i have gotten for my phone and it's also very stylish,5
5589,from my wife it was so cute the first time i bought it but better than huge otterbox,5
5590,this external battery pack is ideal for those of you who travel with several children who are playing minecraft nonstop,5
5591,you get six for about two bucks and you just can't beat the price and rightfully so,5
5592,i find the screen size a definite positive it makes surfing the web and watching movies a joy on the giant vivid screen,5
5593,i got this because i was tired of carrying the phone on my hip,5
5594,i was hoping for a bit longer cable to use in my car for a samsung galaxy s4 phone,5
5595,the lcd screen protector is a great addition to the snugg ipad cover,5
5596,this is great for keeping in my car so i can charge my phone and a spare battery at the same time,5
5597,super duper cute i love this case i have so many compliments on this case every time i'm out,5
5598,it takes a little getting used to in reading how much power remains in the power banks and it recharges quickly,5
5599,sgp always makes excellent products and i always try to buy mifi certified apple accessories whenever possible,5
5600,however after using it for a little while i must say that this case looks wonderfully on my phone,5
5601,the kick-stand is a plus when i want to watch videos on the iphone,5
5602,i've been using mine for about 2 months now and it is holding up really well,5
5603,the dual port powergen is great since it has plenty of power to charge multiple devices simultaneously and repetitively,5
5604,it also has a good grip to it won't have to worry about it peeling of getting messed up,5
5605,glad i got i at a good price but it was a bit hard to tell if it was lined up correctly,5
5606,simple great fit front edge raised just enough to protect the screen when the phone is face-down,5
5607,it is a car charger and it works just like it is supposed to and seems to be very strong and sturdy,5
5608,i modified one to use it in my car and love the glowing light,5
5609,this is the exact same model i have for my iphone 5 i always come back to this one,5
5610,battery capacity at 10 000 mah astro3 is the largest-capacity external usb battery that i've ever tested,5
5611,i had pretty much this exact case for my galaxy s3 and i still love this case,5
5612,1 amps and that one is for apple products and the other is for a bluetooth keyboard case for the ipad air,5
5613,i like that it covers more of the front of the phone but enough for the whole screen,5
5614,nearly as good as the jawbone at less than half the price that it would be at the apple store,5
5615,my recommendation is that if you're in the market for a new case but when i saw this color couldn't resist getting it,5
5616,the case is just what i was looking for and works like a charm,5
5617,the charge light will let you know when it's charging red and full green,5
5618,the color is so pretty it looks just like the picture above it makes my phone look awesome and protects it from drops,5
5619,i tend to keep my phone in my pocket so i really wanted some protection from scratches,5
5620,the blueant has the annoying flashing blue light to let you know you are now collecting solar power for output,5
5621,i have a slim case and i don't even need to take my phone out of my pocket is extremely convenient,5
5622,with two ports it can charge two devices at once and one of the slots has enough juice to charge an ipad,5
5623,also it doesnt show the light on the top that turns on when a device is placed on the designated qi area,5
5624,the buttons are a bit hard to push on the sides of the phone holder,5
5625,but if that's not an issue you want to keep the look and feel of the case,5
5626,plenty of sound and for the price you'd be hard pressed to justify phone insurance with this case,5
5627,i purchased these cases so that i could change the color of my phone case about every three to four months anyway,5
5628,this is by far one of the best products i've ever owned and i just generally like the feel,5
5629,the battery now lasts two full days of normal use out of one charge,5
5630,this case wouldn't provide any protection if you were to drop you phone on it's back or side,5
5631,the dimple on the back is a nice touch and keeps it from looking like a toy,5
5632,it has two output usb ports and a micro usb input port for charging and a led flashlight,5
5633,little tight because the battery is slightly thicker than an iphone actually it is about the same thickness as my naked thunderbolt,5
5634,i do a lot of phone work and these are by far the best i've had but there is definitely room for improvement,5
5635,one improvement suggestion i have is to add a small led indicator on the top that shows when it is powered on,5
5636,it took a little more than an hour and a half to charge said phone from three percent,5
5637,it's also nice that they come with everything you need to install the screen protector perfectly the very first time,5
5638,recently at work i was able able to charge my phone while also charging the battery pack itself,5
5639,the headset has been great and i have never had a phone that comes close to the hk htc one m8,5
5640,it black it fits the phone and does what it's designed to do and as such i like it and recommend it,5
5641,i bought several cases and this is definitely one of my favorite cases i've bought from amazon,5
5642,there 8217s also a micro usb input port for charging the power bank,5
5643,they are soo cute and protect my phone when i'm not using my mophie case this speck candy shell flip is my favorite,5
5644,having purchased it and using it for about 3 weeks and it's in perfect shape still,5
5645,i've also used the usb cable that came with this case it started working perfectly,5
5646,this replacement charger works well and it's very hard to clean off,5
5647,you can not go wrong and you will not be disappointed in this seller or there product,5
5648,better than any otterbox and for less than half the price of what you would pay at best buy or a phone store,5
5649,it is truly crystal clear and you can not tell there is a protector on the screen,5
5650,but i recommend this if you like the fact that it will charge our iphones ipods and our ipad 2,5
5651,it might take a few tries to get the timing right to turn on the battery and not looking to draw attention to yourself,5
5652,it was almost fully charged so it did not take long to get to me fast shipment,5
5653,the bottom line is that this is the best phone for you,5
5654,i needed to pick up a case for my wife and i and we are very pleased with it,5
5655,this is a very well made cover it does not add any bulk to the overall size of the phone,5
5656,i bought and returned many cases for both my iphone 5s and my ipad mini plugged in it,5
5657,i have 4 different cases for my phone and this is a must aswell,5
5658,for 40 you really cant go wrong with this mobile phone case,5
5659,i have since purchased another one and have had it for a while its a really awesome phone,5
5660,i've owned several different bluetooth headsets over the years and this is one of the best looking armor case for iphone 5,5
5661,super thin yet adds protection to the phone all the way around and up to where the screen starts,5
5662,it was almost fully charged so it did not take long to get to me fast shipment,5
5663,the card slots are nice and slim i added a flygrip to the back and can now use it one-handed,5
5664,i bought this in pink for my samsung galaxy s4 and finally came upon turn on tech,5
5665,all holes and good and buttons are easy to press with the case on and all ports are easily accessible,5
5666,and the thin limp cable seems to be less prone to tangling which is a big plus,5
5667,one piece so theirs no corners coming apart like some of the others that i purchased in the past,5
5668,also there is a slight lip around the edge of the front of the phone,5
5669,that is to say there is a small amount of rubber around the sides,5
5670,it fits over the standard battery and backing and keeps the phone from slipping out of my hand especially if they are wet,5
5671,i love this little sleeve it's great if you're into coordinating like i am,5
5672,i like the feel of it and it fits my phone perfectly and is easy to use,5
5673,factory match to the cord that came with the phone but i still want protection,5
5674,i've used two of the ports simultaneously to charge my ipad and my galaxy note at the same time,5
5675,the other cases were lighter colors so i am not sure if that is just because of the z1 phone,5
5676,i was able to charge my iphone 5 regardless of the protective cases used,5
5677,the charger looks nice and has a solid and well-built piece of sonic assault awaits your ears,5
5678,this is exactly what i needed so i don't have to worry about which device gets which port,5
5679,the case does cover the home button and volume buttons are very easy to push and nice overall,5
5680,i have to say that when i opened the box and saw all that it comes with,5
5681,this is a better deal and does everything i want it to do and it does that very well indeed,5
5682,pros makes the phone comfortable to hold and doesn't add a lot of weight to the phone,5
5683,the nt88c unlike one of my other chargers utilizes the usb cable provided with the devices you want to charge wit the battery,5
5684,i have only used it for a week but so for i like it,5
5685,of course the trick could be that oem battery starting to show it's age though but that's to be expected,5
5686,when i first ordered it i didn't pay attention to the fact that this is for the iphone 4 4s,5
5687,but i'd have to say this is a very nice charger and works well too,5
5688,there is no glare on the phone and really there is not a problem with the darker colors like navy blue black brown etc,5
5689,the battery is small enough to fit in my pocket or leather holster,5
5690,i had a full battery at the end of the day while i was still working on it,5
5691,i think my daughters are going to have a hard time stopping dad from borrowing them,5
5692,it looks good on my white s4 but i don't know how much power you have left on the charger,5
5693,these are my my favorite i use it all the time when i'm driving my car,5
5694,i will say that sometimes i will wear it and it feels really good in hand and adds no bulk in pocket,5
5695,this case is really nice it came in a few days as described and easy to put on,5
5696,it's really tempting to get a case for your iphone get this one,5
5697,it's one of the best cases i've had for any phone and i've bought a lot,5
5698,it was time for a new one i was so happy to see that it fit my phone,5
5699,they say to never judge a book by its cover that's for sure,5
5700,this charger does exactly what i would have expected it to do which is to sit still plugged into a sound dock,5
5701,keep in mind i tossed the charger and usb cable that came with my samsung focus cell phone and works great,5
5702,for the price i paid this is one of the best investments i have made for my ipad,5
5703,i bought mine earlier this year and paid a lot more for and he lliked this one just as much as my other,5
5704,this case is the best wallet case i've ever owned and the size is far smaller than i expected,5
5705,when they get dirty you can pull it off and start over and 2,5
5706,the only real downside is that you can't charge the phone and use the flash,5
5707,this shell and holster combo is exactly what i need and it was a good investment,5
5708,i'm happy to have purchased this charger and would recommend it to anyone looking for portable power on the go,5
5709,would recommend highly for anyone looking for a case for their lg g2,5
5710,arrived quickly and seems like a quality product that doesn't add a lot of bulk to an already large cell phone,5
5711,sadly that is when i'm most likely to use the heart rate sensor while using the exercise portion of the app,5
5712,i got along with it so well that i decided to buy this instead of the cheap ones,5
5713,this does work just fine and i like the shorter length so i don't have to scroll up and down trying to find exit,5
5714,mine came today and i couldn't be happier with the performance for the price,5
5715,the only thing to watch out is that the headphone jack is too narrow and deep to fit wider headphone plugs,5
5716,now please keep in mind that these are headphones and not meant to be used outside as a rain shower could damage it,5
5717,1 display is covered with slightly curved gorilla glass that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units,5
5718,with this glass screen however there were no bubbles at all and super easy to install,5
5719,i never find myself worrying if i am going to have to down the line since i can be clumsy,5
5720,but the devices are already a little big so the last thing you want is add more unnecessary bulk to the device,5
5721,it's slightly heavy and i wouldn't recommend carrying it in your pocket or in a purse all the time,5
5722,you can stick and remove this mount as many times as you want as long as you have the cable you can charge your devices,5
5723,i love this case and have dropped my phone numerous times and it's still kicking,5
5724,the case has a nice small lip to protect the screen when it stick it in my pocket or purse,5
5725,only used it for a short time now but i can tell it is a bit thick by looking at the camera cutout,5
5726,update 3 26 2014after i posted this review anker reached out to me and sent me a new one that works great,5
5727,carrying two differentcables might seem like it isn't a big deal to pop the case off to use them,5
5728,so far it has turn out to be a good phone for at least the next 2-3 years,5
5729,it takes a little time to get it on the phone without removing the sleeve first,5
5730,ordered because my battery wasn't holding a charge and i wasn't sure if that was going to happen,5
5731,i'm very pleased with this case and for the price is definitely worth a second look,5
5732,i haven't tried any other cases i just know what i look for in a phone case because i hate bulky thick cases,5
5733,flexible or you can provide your own cables for both charging the power bank and charging other devices from the power bank,5
5734,i think some earphone jacks may interfere with the case but i think its cut way too small,5
5735,i bought this case because of the low price needless to say i am very impressed with the powerpak 11,5
5736,this is a genuine samsung product identical to the one i got with my android phone so it works great,5
5737,for me since its my first smartphone there was a bit of a learning curve with this coming from the htc hero,5
5738,i just wanted a case that protects the phone as well as not showing much signs of damage,5
5739,it arrived quickly and i tried it out as soon as i got it and am in love with it,5
5740,the 30 or so you spend on this is way better than the 4 corners clamp i'd been using,5
5741,in terms of specifications the s4 has a lot going for it including its price currently twenty six,5
5742,came with a spare battery that was the main reason i got it and im so glad i made it,5
5743,i haven't had the phone long enough to say my last word about this babyupdate 05 09 2013 downgrade,5
5744,i love to listen to music when i am at work and have the ability to charge it in my pc,5
5745,this one came with good reviews and i figured i would give it another shot and these are perfect,5
5746,crystal clear easy to put on as long as you clean the screen well first they go on well,5
5747,it is a must to have if you use your phone a lot and especially if you're on the go,5
5748,they're good for that plus the material can be used to clean the battery pack or your ipad or other device screen,5
5749,it does make it a little hard to press the power button it doesn't have a good grip,5
5750,it's corlorful work good for charging i have not used any other brand so i can't compare but i love these,5
5751,was on sale and does what it is supposed to do protect my phone,5
5752,great case if you dont want to have chargers all over the house this is a great way to go,5
5753,now that i have it i can't imagine not having one of these on a phone,5
5754,although many people have said that you have to use the naked phone to dock properly,5
5755,i have put a lot of apps on this phone and have not been disappointed in the slightest,5
5756,i can charge anywhere any time as long as i have bluetooth function turned on on my phone,5
5757,i always have a back up battery for my cell phone,5
5758,when i go on walks am able to place my phone in and out of the holster,5
5759,overall it works great and i would recommend it to my friend and family,5
5760,bought for my 3 yr old son to be able to use the camera without the case interfering,5
5761,i purchased this as a gift for a friend and it took awhile to get used to the way they fit,5
5762,phone snaps in nice and snug and it's easy to get the phone in and out,5
5763,on the other hand i love the ability to listen to my audio without having the wires attached,5
5764,this is probably one of my favorite cases i have used for my nexus 4 phone,5
5765,this kit came with everything needed to replace the battery in my phone with a fresh battery,5
5766,this is one of well used to be one of my favorite made in china but stand by their products companies,5
5767,so far i am very happy with this purchase and will recommend this to anyone who has broke their ipod touch screen,5
5768,this battery can be charged with a micro usb cable when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic,5
5769,i bought one from my local at t store for my iphone 5 after having horrible luck with the apple chargers,5
5770,it has taken some abuse and i wear it most of the day on project sites while driving even at home,5
5771,i purchased 3 of these one for my car and one for work,5
5772,i have mine with me all the time and not have to take the ones out of our power go bag,5
5773,it has has enough edge lip to protect the screen when you want to have your phone facedown,5
5774,the best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled and doesn't take up much space in my purse,5
5775,now all i have to do is open the battery thingy,5
5776,i love the flexibility of the adjustable parts and the strength of the suction cup and it's stayed put on my beanbag ever since,5
5777,also the dual port charger can be used to charge anything with a usb connection on one end so it is versatile,5
5778,the speaker on the device also seems quite loud though i don't use that part because i don't have a newer tv,5
5779,there 8217s no power level indicator 8211 just one usb output port 1a and a micro usb input port for conventional recharging,5
5780,on top of the great performance this is 1 2 the price of the charger that google sells,5
5781,cons there is a sticker on the inside of the case is made from brown suede,5
5782,this is the second elago s5 case i've purchased for my different smart phones over the years,5
5783,what more can i say as long as it doesn't fall out i'm fine with it,5
5784,one of the things i liked about this battery pack is the sleek ergonomic feel of the uhuru,5
5785,the screen protector is one of the best i've seen on any android phone,5
5786,overall for the money this is a great item to get if you have a samsung galaxy note ii which is a rather large phone,5
5787,i'm happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends,5
5788,she dropped it many times and was in rain more times than i can count and this is the one that really functions well,5
5789,got this cover love it have since ordered in other colors so i can switch up with whatever iam wearing,5
5790,when the speaker is ringing and you do not want to carry a wallet with you,5
5791,and so far i've very happy with this case and highly recommend it,5
5792,it folds down small enough to fit in the palm of your hand or anywhere else in the car,5
5793,another cool thing about this phone is that the charging port is on the side of the device leaving little room for confusion,5
5794,it's a snug fit but you don't have to be mcguiver to get it off,5
5795,i've had it over a month and it still looks brand new,5
5796,i have been using this case for about a month and the film is still like new,5
5797,this was the easiest screen protector i have ever put on my phone and i am glad i purchased it,5
5798,the generously padded ear pieces are very comfortable to wear even for hours at a time,5
5799,i highly recommend this case to anyone who has an iphone or ipod,5
5800,they are sturdy keep the phone clean and do an excellent job of protecting your phone as well as being very discreet,5
5801,i ordered this item as a gift for my girlfriend's nexus 4,5
5802,i had initially bought this case when i got the phone but soon after they decided to make the case,5
5803,it feels so snug that it doesn't feel like it is going to fall off,5
5804,i can keep it plugged in all the time so it is there when i need it and it doesn't ask any favors,5
5805,i've dropped my phone a few times already and it charged my phone and my kindle touch,5
5806,i have had this case for some time now and i'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone,5
5807,it still works great and holds it charge as well as it did when i first made my purchase on amazon,5
5808,no do i need to hold the power button for a couple seconds to fire it up,5
5809,she said it works well and she likes it a lot to charger her phone thank you,5
5810,i've applied screen protectors before but this one was by far the best out of the two,5
5811,this product was a gift for my sister-in-law's iphone,5
5812,after doing some research and needed a new battery for my htc and this battery fit the bill,5
5813,the battery life is well just insane and i don't know how i ever did without this,5
5814,so i've been in search of the best screen protector for htc one in the market,5
5815,inside the box you will find a micro usb cord and a stereo cord for not bluetooth devices,5
5816,overall i am super impressed and would totally recommend this product over any other external battery there is out there,5
5817,it's not the most comfortable case and it doesn't have the ability to plug into your car,5
5818,it protects the gs3 without being overly thick and is easy to install on the s3 mini and also very easy to remove it,5
5819,they all work perfectly and hopefully they will continue to do so until they have disappeared completely,5
5820,i've noticed that this charges my iphone 5 faster than either of the previous chargers did,5
5821,you can charge your cellphone and kindle or other devices at the same time without them bumping into or blocking each other,5
5822,i love the colors and it fits perfect on my att phone,5
5823,i've had it for about four months now and it is still holding on the suction,5
5824,so i can have a few for my computer so i don't have to be accurate to type any more,5
5825,0-100 % a blackberry q10 0-100 % and still have enough juice to give an s3 a complete charge,5
5826,alternatively the unit can be recharged from the usb port of a pc but it may require up to 30 hours,5
5827,never had any issues with it coming off when i didn't want it to so it is nice and secure,5
5828,it protects my phone in case it drops the case is cute and doesn't really add that much bulk to it,5
5829,i even like that it perfectly wraps around the front of the phone to lift the film up,5
5830,colors are bright and accurate as far as i can tell this item worked good in my car,5
5831,when i am at school i don't want to have to wait 9 hours for a charge to complete,5
5832,usually at this point you'd have to take it off and reapply it if you get it wrong,5
5833,it is light the color is great and the case isn't big which is also awesome,5
5834,it is a smaller and narrower plug than i have used in the past and it's been spotty on the clarity,5
5835,not that it's made for that reason but i've used it for 2 hour periods and it's still going strong for him,5
5836,0 ii tablet 2013 version black so i went ahead and ordered a replacement since it worked so well,5
5837,in fact it only feels slightly larger than my iphone 5 and weighs about the same,5
5838,another review says the side buttons are a little hard to press but i can manage that,5
5839,when i'm on the headset people tell me they can't tell i am in the car,5
5840,i've had it since early august and there have been no issues after several weeks of use,5
5841,all you do is press and hold the button to start charging the phone which is fast,5
5842,i keep it there so i do not have to carry a wallet around as well,5
5843,i purchased a couple of different cases for my galaxy s3 and the length of the cable is great,5
5844,i have had this skin for a couple of days now and i think it is great,5
5845,now the phone no longer feels like it's going to drop from your hand at any moment,5
5846,its small enough and light enough where i can keep it in my purse or pocket when i'm traveling,5
5847,if you are in the market i would recommend you get this to save your phone from incurring any scratches,5
5848,i prefer this over say an otterbox type because i like my phone to be as slim and light as possible,5
5849,if you are looking for a slim case this is the one for the t-mobile galaxy s2,5
5850,the phone is nice i've had it for about four months now and it is still holding up,5
5851,no charge indicators so you wouldn 8217 t know how much charge it had that number has little value,5
5852,i really like the little light at the end of the built-in micro usb cable and i like the standard usb slot,5
5853,they are lite and easy to wear really easy to pair with my phone so that i can listen to music without holding my phone,5
5854,i use a screen protector but it doesn't seem to shift around much at all,5
5855,i almost didn't buy it because of the fact that it was difficult to fit into a purse or pocket,5
5856,the color is even all throughout and slides in and out of a pocket easily without sticking,5
5857,go into a bathroom close the door and turn the shower on hot to fill the bathroom with steam,5
5858,i only wish there was a bigger pack so i didn't have to worry about the two pieces becoming separated,5
5859,you're not going to be able to use it smoothly,5
5860,i have contacted the company and will update this review if i find anything getting hung-up or crashing,5
5861,i am very happy with this bluetooth adapter as it does exactly what i need perfectly all the time and nothing else,5
5862,i didn't receive my original one and when i contacted the seller they said it was out of stock,5
5863,the case is is well made and has a good feel to it i don't notice that it is not part of the phone,5
5864,i would extremely recommend to anyone looking for a charger with high output,5
5865,wasn't as i expected it's a little darker than the picture but it still a nice blue turquiose color,5
5866,in fact after using it for a couple of weeks and they are quite robust,5
5867,it fits my iphone 5 perfectly and for the price it was well worth it,5
5868,the case comes with a micro usb cable that allows you to charge two devices without getting the cables tangled,5
5869,i was expecting the same thickness of the first protector i bought for my note 2 that was bubble free,5
5870,i have had it a few days now and the battery is fantastic,5
5871,i love them and i am a perfectionist when it comes to screen protectors for the iphone,5
5872,i did not make use of the ability to charge two devices with only one plug is great,5
5873,so bad that they no longer can charge my phone without having to worry about being locked in by my service provider,5
5874,30 minutes later after messed around i just wanted to see if this would work for occasional internet in the wild,5
5875,i have wanted one of these for a while now and they're still working like new,5
5876,i received it this past weekend and i must say i'm very impressed with this cable,5
5877,i just got these in the mail today and i can't express how nice it is to have until you start to use it,5
5878,i tend to be the person providing tech support for my family members so i don't have to worry about your phone any longer,5
5879,you should buy this if you're looking for the following attributes 1,5
5880,bought this clear case for my wife's phone and she loves it,5
5881,i purchased it a couple days ago and will report back on how it worked for me in my travels,5
5882,this phone is already a big phone so they have done a great job on this item,5
5883,the case has a nice smooth feel so sliding it out of your pocket is like sliding a hot knife through butter,5
5884,98 for the set 2 batteries and a charger for such a cheap price,5
5885,sturdy sleek still bigger than i wanted but it is really well made and will not tilt over since it feels solid,5
5886,i love my phone and i've had it for about 3 months now and couldn't be happier with a phone,5
5887,i bought this case for my sister thinking it was for the iphone 5 so i couldn't use it,5
5888,slim and has had a few drops with no damage in the last month,5
5889,i was amazed at how great this product was and at such an affordable price es with a 100 % satisfaction lifetime guarantee,5
5890,i just got her a new phone and i wasn't going to use it a lot 8230 so i tried it,5
5891,i think they are great for the price and the shipping if very fast with amazon prime,5
5892,solar panel feature the solar panel is on one side of the car and the other in the back for guests,5
5893,due to amazon's excellent return policy i gave it a try and they provide everything you could need,5
5894,the phone seems to be built very well especially considering the low price and it has some great features,5
5895,i have been using this headset for about 3 weeks now and charged it maybe 6 times,5
5896,in the interests of full disclosure i was provided this product free of charge for review,5
5897,the icarrier is small but a bit on the heavy side but you get used to it,5
5898,does not make the phone heavy at all and it gives a good look to your already good looking cell,5
5899,so you can keep your case on your phone without worrying that it will make the credit compartment tight,5
5900,ps you can keep your phone too but this is the best case i've found for the nexus 5,5
5901,the charger works great seems pretty durable and it has 2 usb ports so you can charge 2 things at a time,5
5902,it provides a good grip and doesn't add much to the width of the phone itself,5
5903,the extra little bump does indeed make it easier to press the home button place the make the ipod look funky,5
5904,battery took charge just fine but i've also found that the mount grips certain cd slots better than others,5
5905,i find it to be very good in call quality and ease of use but i could never find the right fit,5
5906,the buttons aren't stiff and it is easy to take it off and put it on again,5
5907,it had glitter and the color was exactly what i was looking for and arrived on time,5
5908,for the price i think this is the best case out there for protection,5
5909,i honestly can not do without an extended battery so i purchased the aduro u-grip and was reading customer reviews,5
5910,the name nokia itself gives you the assurance that the phone has to be on the cradle at all times to get signal,5
5911,voice clarity is on a par with any cell phone i've ever owned and there have been a lot,5
5912,i am not a paid reviewer batexwireless is a great company and they have made another great product once again,5
5913,the otterbox defender is probably one of the best headsets i have ever used,5
5914,i've reviewed a lot of different phone cases and this is by far the best screen protector i've purchased for any phone,5
5915,i like this one because its just like the one that came with my lg phone,5
5916,i ave dropped my phone several times and there is not a single mark on the phone,5
5917,the front lip does not interfer with the screen protector at all even when using the holster,5
5918,the case is exactly the size of the phone at first i thought it was defective because the sides would not fit properly,5
5919,really i love that it's still slim enough to fit into a belt loop case,5
5920,i've dropped it several times and this case did it's job i really like it a lot,5
5921,i found this cover and some inexpensive screen protectors here on amazon and i thought i would give it one more try,5
5922,very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking an extremely high quality android phone,5
5923,i've used it for months now and it hasn't let me down yet and the cord and plugs are very sturdy,5
5924,the back is protected but if you drop your phone a lot then this is not the case for you,5
5925,it fit's well and goes in and out of your pocket with ease,5
5926,this compact dual usb charger does a nice job of charging my iphone 5 and samsung galaxy phones,5
5927,it was protected enough not to be damaged when i got it so i had to give it a 5,5
5928,i love the tight fit and i have no worries of it flying around while i drive,5
5929,this charger has plenty of power to charge more than one device at a time,5
5930,overall i have to say this is one of the nicest thing to have,5
5931,the case creates enough of a lip to allow you to place the phone face down without worry of screen damage,5
5932,it allows me to use it both phones at the same time and only carry one charger when away from home,5
5933,the mini side metal part is long enough that my phone is within easy reach and view,5
5934,the added length not only provides the user with the convenience of charging from a usb port makes it worth another try,5
5935,so i would definitely say that the jabra motion bluetooth mono headset is light weight and comfortable,5
5936,i bought these as a present for my mom she loves it she loves minnie mouse,5
5937,this is especially handy for the times you're on the go need to charge your power hungry devices,5
5938,this isn't designed for putting a lot of pressure on it or you will scratch the screen,5
5939,8 oz 136 g i was supplied a sample for the purpose of review and evaluation and promised an unbiased review,5
5940,people dont know i'm on a headset even when i'm in a noisy environment and i hear them well,5
5941,the outside of the case is a hard but has a little bit of rubbery grip to it,5
5942,the two-piece design is what makes it easy for me to hold when i go running,5
5943,worked really well and allows me to charge my phone with the battery pack and it worked perfectly,5
5944,it's one of the clearest smoothest screen protectors i've ever put on a phone that had no bubbles at all,5
5945,seidio fixed that little oversite by including an adapter so you can use all the galaxy phones with mhl enabled hardware,5
5946,i purchased for my mother-in-law and she absolutely loves it,5
5947,five stars for perfect fit i keep my note 2 in a tpu case and it fits inside this mount perfectly,5
5948,this is hands down the best mount i use it on my motorcycle so my phone is not out in the open,5
5949,the charger is a usb cable which you can use to charge it or leave it plugged in which ever you want,5
5950,i would have paid more but i'm glad i didn't buy the 20 cases that are offered at stores,5
5951,one thing a lot of people don't even realize you have it on after a while,5
5952,i had purchased a second battery after i dropped my phone and the screen had a giant crack on it,5
5953,the two 5v 2a usb ports allow me to charge my cell phone whenever i go,5
5954,otherwise would highly recommend it for anyone with an i phone,5
5955,i had purchased another cover similar to this one and it was a piece of junk,5
5956,i've had no issues opening up the back of the phone to show while protecting it from scratches,5
5957,i received a complimentary car charger to test and am very happy with the quality and utility of this external battery,5
5958,had no issues installing screen protector and installed it is almost impossible to see to answer a call or to place a call,5
5959,that means that those of you hoping to use it on t-mobile but was only getting edge speeds on data,5
5960,oil is also very easy to remove the phone from your holster or pocket,5
5961,i've even had 2 tablets charging at the same time while on the road this may be a consideration,5
5962,this is a nice device to have when you need the ability to charge them without running out of outlets,5
5963,i can't even tell i have a screen protector on my ipod touch 5th gen for about a week now and it works great,5
5964,although lightweight the construction is very solid and precise so it does feel good in the hand very solid and well made,5
5965,over the past several years i've gotten a number of these for friends and use it myself,5
5966,this case is amazing i love it so much it makes my phone look all robot-y and awesome,5
5967,bought it so i could switch out when i'm out in the ocean particularly on my paddle-board,5
5968,but i still love the product and would recommend to anyone looking for a good cheap screen protector,5
5969,i definitely recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a simple but cute case,5
5970,got this for a spare and it works just as good as another one not soo good,5
5971,what it does is it allows you to use the iphone while it's housed in the case,5
5972,it is completely useable and can only be seen when looking very closely under direct light,5
5973,loved it and it has a good feel in my hand,5
5974,once i had everything back together i placed my phone on the charger it signaled a charge,5
5975,i wanted to be able to charge my phone my wife's phone and the tablet with ease,5
5976,as we all know android devices vary greatly when it comes to battery life price ease of use and functionality,5
5977,he says the feel of the case makes the phone look classy and stylish,5
5978,it provides only minimal protection though when i dropped my phone a couple of times and the case protected my phone,5
5979,i have an older car so i don't have a long cable getting tangle with other things,5
5980,it is good and can charge the phone from 5 % with a cruzerlite bugdroid on,5
5981,many people will already have a couple of these lying around the house if you have any apple products,5
5982,but anyway this case is so cute and i love the colors,5
5983,recommend to anybody looking for a great case that will protect the phone from bumps and at least some dropping,5
5984,it adds less than 2 mm to the thickness of the phone but for me it feels good,5
5985,i've dropped my phone a couple of times and decided i needed one,5
5986,especially if you don't have any other devices that charge via usb this is a must have for business travelers,5
5987,the holster holds the phone very well and i use it everyday on two devices,5
5988,starting from 10 % it was able to fully charge an ipad because the ipad battery capacity is much larger,5
5989,i have used the case for about a week now and so far it is superior to the oem battery,5
5990,5 note 2 screen was just big enough to be a little difficult to grip sometimes,5
5991,i had the original one i got from this seller because it is a good price and fits perfectly,5
5992,the lights are handy when you're in the car on the trip so i could watch movies while we were traveling,5
5993,the sound is great and loud for the size of the speaker this speaker has pretty good sound,5
5994,overall though i never had any problems with it and i'm super happy with the price,5
5995,it's doing very well there out of the way of the shifter when i put it into park,5
5996,as a final note i did read in one of the reviews that there is no front facing camera,5
5997,when i hang out with my buddies at the end of the day your phone is not dead,5
5998,i have an iphone 5 and it really doesn't seem to cause any problems or get in the way,5
5999,holding the iphone in the case does not add much weight or bulk to the phone,5
6000,i have had it now for a month or so and its not scratched or peeling at all,5
6001,is perfect for the hone easy to use and easy to transfer your old tracfone account to,5
6002,only downside and no fault to the product is that you must use oem connection cables,5
6003,the product arrived in a timely manner and seems to work well with any usb charger i use it for,5
6004,i guess its a nice bonus as long as i don't have my portenzo case on it,5
6005,one of my favorite things about this product is that it includes an fm radio a 3,5
6006,to my pleasant surprise there was not a single scratch on the screen or the phone itself,5
6007,just loop the ring through your stylus and then plug the other end of the usb micro cable into the pod,5
6008,they are easy to use and apply cause no loss of touch sensitivity and not too sticky when swiping my finger across it,5
6009,i wanted a corded handset because i'm tired of having to drag extension cords from room to room,5
6010,get it if you need a case to protect your phone from dropping it on the ground,5
6011,i recently upgraded from the original droid with the slide-out keyboard and this fit her phone very well,5
6012,she has said she would like to easily know how much battery life is left something that the 300 sony's don't do,5
6013,was easy to get used to and i use it a lot and the dual usb is good to have,5
6014,when i am at school i don't want to have to swap them out of the phone to charge them,5
6015,first i took it off put on the screen protector and how to clean it afterward,5
6016,i keep this one in my shop so i don't have to carry it around and just leave it in the car,5
6017,i find that many smartphones can not make it through a full day without charge using the phone a good amount throughout,5
6018,if you are really hard on your phone or work in an environment that might not be safe for smart phones,5
6019,my only real complaint is that the strip that covers the top of the phone and the bottom this case does not,5
6020,i prefer the feel and smoothness of the glass on the phone and all the time looking like she was listening to the wall,5
6021,i drop my phone daily and while i would not recommend drop testing it seems reasonably rugged,5
6022,with this adjustable and rubberized stand i don't have to remove the frame each time to get at the card,5
6023,i love this case it is definitely worth the price if you are looking for a pen and stylus combo feature that is also inexpensive,5
6024,i fell in love with it as soon as i got it and used it for jogging i was glad i took the chance,5
6025,sure i had to compromise and discarded certain apps that i don't really need because of the 2x battery life,5
6026,we thought it wouldn't be as good as the otter box cases for a fraction of the price,5
6027,the ratcheting feature to hold the phone is very cool and i'm very pleased with the quality of the product,5
6028,can remove the battery if you didn't want to wear a t shirt,5
6029,probably not the best if you are clumsy with the phone but it does what its suppose to so no real complaints here,5
6030,it looked exactly like it did online when i got it and it was fully charged when was a plus,5
6031,i do not notice any difference in the amount of time it takes to fully charge an empty case battery,5
6032,they have changed the feel of the case and i think it will then fit absolutely perfectly,5
6033,the iflash 4400 can also be recharged from a usb port but i also used a 5v 0,5
6034,it is possible to turn off the bt radio if you don't need it just ignore it to the side,5
6035,the length was plenty long and it is always good idea to have a secondary charger in case the original stops working,5
6036,the sound is good but it would have been nice to be able to select a color when purchasing on here,5
6037,this cable is well worth the extra money for the sound quality and comfort these give,5
6038,my needs are pretty standard i wanted a case to protect my new htc evo 4 g phone,5
6039,i've actually dropped my phone a few times and so far it works fine,5
6040,i've been using this product for a few weeks and i must say it is a welcomed addition to my phone,5
6041,it has two usb ports so my husband and i can both charge our phones on the same car ride,5
6042,the micro usb and lightning cables snap into the side of the battery and i used their cable and my iphone charger,5
6043,i don't notice it and i don't think i will ever go back to anything else,5
6044,i would say it is of great quality and i would recommend this product hands down,5
6045,i have bought this and use it with my samsung epic 4 g touch samsung galaxys ii,5
6046,the back which has the battery fits well on the phone and the this combination looks like made of each other,5
6047,i can not stress it's slim design enough i have tried many cases for my note 2 and now for the s4,5
6048,it was really easy to put on my phone and it looks great,5
6049,the only major glaring difference is that it does not have to hang over my ear,5
6050,please check this site out the item arrived on time and was just as it was described,5
6051,but now that i've had it a month and it's still on there over 2 years later,5
6052,being ex-military and when i saw this i had to buy it,5
6053,to turn it on you have to give it a couple of days before i expected to,5
6054,i have dropped my phone a few times now with no damage to the phone and no scuffs or anything to the case,5
6055,these batteries work at least as well as the battery that came with the note 3 phone,5
6056,note that if you have a slim iphone case the edges of the screen protector fit under the rim of the case,5
6057,0 iphone ipad old style and of course you can supply your own wire and you supply your own wall charger,5
6058,bought for my cell phone the charger is great i have several from remnants of past palm products,5
6059,wish it came with a wall charger in case you are stuck in an airport with throngs of people due to bad weather,5
6060,i think it looks great on the white version of this phone which my daughter has,5
6061,additionally if your screen protector is installed too close to the edge of the phone with a case on it,5
6062,disclaimer i received this product from anker at no cost in exchange for writing a review and am glad that i did,5
6063,it looks good feels nice has grips on the sides to increase traction in your hand,5
6064,i bought this for my my wife's iphone 4 and ipad 3 as good as apple made model,5
6065,in my opinion trident has some of the best phone cases and this one is no exception,5
6066,i think this battery is much better than the stock battery that came with my phone,5
6067,when your screen protector offers a great deal of protection without adding much bulk,5
6068,however if you're just looking for a phone that will remain relevant for a while,5
6069,listener from other end says my voice is loud and clear enough to annoy the neighbors if i choose,5
6070,it will drop the sound though the person on the other end can't even tell i am on speaker phone,5
6071,this case fits very snug and is very comfortable in my hand and i loved the honeycomb design,5
6072,i purchased another batter for my husband because when we are on the road it minimizes the plugs that we need,5
6073,i have bought plenty of aftermarket chargers for my iphone 5 and this is very similar if not the same,5
6074,my son has to sit in the back of the car and have my conversation to the front,5
6075,great value and i will order again in a different color when i'm bored with it,5
6076,it fits like a glove and is just as good as the incase for a fraction of the cost of an otter box,5
6077,the best thing about it is that i am able to charge two phones or a phone and our tab 2 10,5
6078,they are easy to remove if you have to change the battery the case comes off easily enough,5
6079,inside the box you will find a micro usb cord and a stereo cord for not bluetooth devices,5
6080,also the case wraps to the front of the phone meaning there is a lip on the case,5
6081,ps in case it matters to you in consider this my phone is an htc evo shift with which i have in an otterbox case,5
6082,if you are looking for extra battery life for your iphone and that is a big deal,5
6083,overall i am very satisfied with the quality of this product and because of their world-class customer service,5
6084,this product is durable small enough that it's not a pain to fold it off for charging,5
6085,i was and still am a huge fan of the products of this firm,5
6086,which pushes 5v 1 amp and this will charge both the case and the iphone have survived his freshman year in college,5
6087,it is quite rugged and can take a beating i have dropped it a couple of time but it held up,5
6088,the nice little kick stand is a plus when i'm at my desk,5
6089,1a of power at 5v 20w it has two usb ports that can power charge two devices at the same time,5
6090,i would say that this works about 90 % of the time i am not in my car,5
6091,holes and cutouts are in the correct place and all the controls are easy to use and easy to mount and dismount if necesary,5
6092,my oem back had the button break so i took a chance on it and was very happy i did,5
6093,trident makes a great product and the fact that they can pair with two devices simultaneously,5
6094,i find those to be more than sufficient for my work vehicle too,5
6095,i have not had it long but so far i'm happy with it,5
6096,especially if i've been using my phone without a protector,5
6097,at first it looked a little gimmicky and i thought i wasn't going to like it but i love it,5
6098,i am so pleased with my purchase and i will not hesitate to purchase from them again and i'm sure i will,5
6099,this is also an incredible feature if you use your phone for everything and carry it everywhere,5
6100,i loved this battery it worked and lasted about the same as my iphone 3gs til about 3 pm,5
6101,everything you're phone had out of the box this is by far the best there is,5
6102,now i just bring the wires and i can charge both of our phones at the same time,5
6103,this particular batch i bought for my mother-in-law owns an ipad mini and an iphone 4s,5
6104,i have a place for my headset when i don't need to carry an extra battery any longer,5
6105,super duper cute i love this case i have received many compliments on this faceplate,5
6106,these are for people who want to listen to their music through some quality wired headphones,5
6107,right now i am charging an ipod an iphone and a backup battery charger all at once,5
6108,it's convenient easy to get to the phone in and out of my pockets because of the grip sides,5
6109,buy this and you will not be disappointed in these skins,5
6110,love this case it was a little hard to put on phone but very nice product,5
6111,i used it exclusively with the suction cup mount i can't comment on the screen protector as i didn't use it,5
6112,as for protecting the phone it seems like it will do a good job of protecting the screen from scratches and nicks,5
6113,at 30 on amazon it's a great deal compared to the competition which is often much more expensive 20,5
6114,i have used if for a long time now and these are some of the best i've found,5
6115,i could charge my kindle and my iphone at the same time using the usb port on the side,5
6116,case is a perfect fit and it has a kick stand which is nice and strong,5
6117,it's just a tiny bit thicker than i would've liked but that's a touchscreen limitation,5
6118,they're great if you wear glasses because of the way they fit rather than any sound quality issue,5
6119,i'm no fan of suction power but i've had this one for almost two months and it still works,5
6120,the thing literally works the same as the apple cable that came with my iphone and the color matches the phone so that's awesome,5
6121,this mirror screen protector is a great addition to your out-door toolkit,5
6122,i discover that i was able to fully charge my ipad and iphone on one outlet,5
6123,this product was great i got a new phone so i don't know what kind of problems people had with this or why,5
6124,by the way both goodnotes and upad apps are a must have for those who text type novel length emails and reviews,5
6125,its a very good item for my new phone and i'm very happy with it,5
6126,03 amps-other 2 amp usb port charged my ipad air at 2,5
6127,it looks very well on the phone and is easy to use the buttons and plugs on the phone,5
6128,this is the third case i have bought for this phone and the one i'm sticking with for as long as they make them,5
6129,now i can look forward to using my phone without having to worry about being right next to a charging portal,5
6130,if you have a evo then you know why its a good idea to get several and change them once in a while,5
6131,i'm very pleased with this product it is exactly what i wanted and was perfect,5
6132,the power button is a bit hard to use because of the design of the htc one i'll admit,5
6133,but this tool is by far the best option out there for price quality protection and peace of mind,5
6134,once it is on correctly the buttons are easy to use as well a definite improvement from the last one i ordered,5
6135,with the battery i can go a full day from early in the morning until late at night without a recharge,5
6136,i never feel like the phone is going to slide out of my hand more,5
6137,i am really enjoying the galaxy s3 the screen is beautiful and the 8 mg pixel camera is great,5
6138,you are getting a great phone for a great price and you can afford tomess one up and try again,5
6139,though not an incredible product this gets 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what it says it will do,5
6140,this case is pretty nice and i really can't complain about having a different color for every day,5
6141,it is raised a little above the screen so you don't have to worry about scratching the sides,5
6142,the lights are handy when you're in the car on the trip so i could watch movies while we were traveling,5
6143,other than that it does what you need it to do which is to sit still plugged into a sound dock,5
6144,this is very well-implemented and easy to use and makes the phone accessible without taking it out of the case,5
6145,i would definitely recommend buying one if your looking for a great smart phone for a great price you found it,5
6146,i bought this because i wanted to be able to charge two things at once which is fantastic for those who havelimited outlets or space,5
6147,0 connection cord is great and you can still plug the charger and headphones it with it on,5
6148,the case does the job and is easy to put on and remove but wont come apart,5
6149,i need a case for work so i don't have to cary a bulky wallet to just carry 2 things,5
6150,if you don't mind a thicker build and do not want to carry a purse this is the great to use,5
6151,overall i think this is a great case for my wife because she loves the color pink,5
6152,yes it adds a bit of bulk but you can still put the phone in places i could without the case,5
6153,the charger quickly powers your phone and looks good while doing it don't look anywhere else,5
6154,i pretty much like everything about the case and have had it for about 4 months and still looks good,5
6155,does what it is made for seems to be of good quality and a wallet like this one is hard to find,5
6156,last but not least i like it so much that i bought a matte protector for my ipad 2,5
6157,the screen is incredible the speakers are loud and clear and the bluetooth allows workouts without wires,5
6158,it adds girth to the phone but not nearly as much as some of its competitors,5
6159,i have also dropped the phone a couple of times and nothing happened not even a scratch to the case,5
6160,it has a nice soft pad for the back of the phone and the hard shell fits just as tightly and firm over the rubber,5
6161,pull the plastic off the back of the case and the battery turns on,5
6162,the only thing that could be better about the case is that it does not come with a holster,5
6163,i've had this product for quite some time now and just love the credit card slots inside,5
6164,it hasn't faded yet and i've had it for about 6 months now and there still powerful,5
6165,another benefit of this case is that it takes some time to get used to,5
6166,the screen protector prevented me from being able to see the screen at 100 % with the gn,5
6167,some reviews say that the buttons are hard to press at first but you get used to it after a while,5
6168,i really like the fact that i can charge my phone and headset with the same chargers,5
6169,i do feel that the charger is a bit longer than i would have preferredit gets warm not hot during use,5
6170,you can use this powerbank to recharge 2 devices at the same time if you plug in a usb cable,5
6171,the wall unit got warm but no where near as hot as the apple charger which usually getsuncomfortably hot to touch,5
6172,feels nice in the hand and is easy to carry around with you in your pocket,5
6173,the best part is being able to charge two devices at the same time without one of them losing the charge every few minutes,5
6174,it doesn't do that at all when i have it plugged in and i have not had any issues with it,5
6175,i haven't kept track of how long it takes to charge your phone or devices battery,5
6176,it does what i wanted so i'm happy with this case and i'm hoping in the near future to buy another,5
6177,this car charger is a must for anyone who uses their phone much for anything,5
6178,the tip is small enough so that i don't worry about dropping the phone 4 feet to any ground surface,5
6179,i like the feel of the case itself and i don't have to open my ipad to change the music especially in flights,5
6180,these are easy to apply do a great job of protecting the device and storing about 2-3 credit cards,5
6181,the case adds a bit of bulk to your phone but i rather that then charge it constantly,5
6182,i was surprised to find an after market extended battery cover for your htc evo 4 g,5
6183,the skin wraps fully around the edges of the screen to provide some protection in the event of a drop,5
6184,i like it and am very happy with it and as long as it protects his phone so are we,5
6185,awesome case it arrived on time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything,5
6186,no problems like some other cases when properly fitting around the edges of the phone incase she were to drop it,5
6187,the case is groovy and has a good grip as well and the color is sweet,5
6188,i loved this case as soon as i ordered my iphone 5 on the first try without bothering with the instructions,5
6189,perhaps one of the things i like most about this case is the finish,5
6190,the setup was easy and the sound quality is pretty good given the size,5
6191,that's when you have a lot of things to charge anymore,5
6192,another great thing about this cable is that it is flat it does not coil up and tangle,5
6193,it works really well for charging my galaxy note 3 and my lg tablet at the same time very quickly,5
6194,the manufacturer provided me a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation,5
6195,these seem to be a lot easier to put on and take off the phone,5
6196,i used 4 other chargers non of them even come close to the wonder that is the arkon ipm515,5
6197,i use it with an iphone 4s and an iphone 5 at the same time but the maximum overall output will limited to 4a,5
6198,just make sure you buy a case to protect the phone from scratches and a small drops,5
6199,i have an otter box case on my phone and the charger works right through it,5
6200,i've had a few in the past where once you snap it on it's not going to be flexing in different directions,5
6201,it has a snug fit cutouts are precise and buttons are easy to press with the case on which is also a plus,5
6202,in fact this is the first time i've ever put one of these on without a problem,5
6203,all appropriate things are covered and i didn't have any issues they went right on,5
6204,it fits perfectly and it doesn't make it look very bulky,5
6205,this charger works great i use it daily in the car to keep my smart phone charged while using as a gps in the vehicle,5
6206,i like this one because its just like the one that came with phone except it says travel charger,5
6207,i would have to disagree with some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every night,5
6208,i have had this on the phone for 2-3 months now and still no bubbling,5
6209,this product had pretty good reviews so i decided to take the plunge after reading other reviews on here,5
6210,it has 2 dedicated ports just for charging tablets which is a huge plus and i didn't really expect it,5
6211,i've been using this product for a few weeks and it worked great,5
6212,there are many screen protectors out there and i've used many different brands for screen protectors for my iphones,5
6213,love the case it keeps my phone well protected and i also like the screen protector on this one,5
6214,it also is very easy to remove if you need to pull the battery,5
6215,a 34 must have 34 for us now and it's nice knowing that we can if we ever get another one,5
6216,this is a dual port usb charger and it also comes with a car charger usb charger and a electric home charger,5
6217,you can really get your phone close to you because the arm is so long and it brings the gps closer to you,5
6218,micro usb side of the original cable that came with your iphone and it just charges it there on the spot,5
6219,the battery is very easy to use and i did not need to enter any pin numbers to make the connection,5
6220,it looked like something you buy off the back of a truck or not but the quality is superb,5
6221,i just received this item and i have to say i'm kind of happy about the results,5
6222,i am going to buy another pair that is how happy i am with the company and the quality of the product,5
6223,having a universal two prong cord is a plus because it comes in flat not round,5
6224,i charged my bluetooth headphones my iphone and my kindle fire both more than once from this charger,5
6225,bought this bumper for a little over two bucks from amazon third-party marketplace seller house of stuff for fifteen bucks plus shipping,5
6226,these luxe lean cases have to be one of the best rubber cases ive had for phones,5
6227,it does make it have a hatchback but other then that it's a nice case i recommend,5
6228,it works as expected and is a very respectable performance for a speaker of this size as well as the voice quality for phone calls,5
6229,still it looks good enough and it's doing what it's supposed to do and it seems to be good quality,5
6230,i've had this case on my phone and i would like it even without the glass protector,5
6231,not the cases fault just a fact of life if you want to protect your tablet then get a screen protector like this one,5
6232,i read the reviews before buying and decided to go for it despite reports of duds crazy risk-taker,5
6233,the cable seems to be built fine and so far i have had no issues with other anker brand batteries,5
6234,there are 2 belt loops that i don't use and battery life is very satisfactory,5
6235,md nker ekrj k just buy it you cant go wrong with them they are the best out there,5
6236,bought this bumper for a little over two bucks from amazon third-party marketplace seller crazy-store for fifty-five cents,5
6237,the controls are easy to manipulate on the top of the unit which has an led screen showing the level of charge,5
6238,this holster is a perfect fit for use with the seidio extended battery htc evo 4 g,5
6239,i get battery backups like these as gifts for my friends as they upgraded their phones,5
6240,i love keeping this little power nugget in my purse for when i am in someone else's car,5
6241,i have dropped my iphone several times with case and am happy to say it is still in one piece,5
6242,i really put this thing to the test over the weekend and was overall pleased with the results,5
6243,to my pleasant surprise there was not a single scratch on the phone and i like the classy look of it,5
6244,she said it was easy to apply and came with directions,5
6245,if i keep my phone in my pants pocket with no problem and is relatively light,5
6246,i have owned many as in 5 or 6 bluetooth headsets and this is the first one i've been happy with so far,5
6247,the fit is so perfect that it almost feels like part of the phone after using it for a few months,5
6248,what i really like most is that it doesn't add too much bulk and has some pretty good protection,5
6249,i like it better this way as the phone is less likely to fall out of your hand or even off book,5
6250,i would defiantly recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their phone and prone to accidents,5
6251,it has an led light to let you know that it is connected properly,5
6252,the sound is great especially for the price you can't beat it,5
6253,it's been about 2 and a half weeks now and it's still as strong as the first time use,5
6254,if you are thinking of skipping this step all i can say is you get what you pay for 34 and this follows that minimally,5
6255,before i bought a similar part from a different seller and the cable that came with my phone and works just as good,5
6256,it works very well with the imp120d and charges my samsung galaxy s4 at full speed about 3 hours to fully charge the device,5
6257,both apple android since its 14000mah i do not have to keep track of the adapter for my 2,5
6258,i tend to carry my phone in my pants pocket with no problem and is relatively light,5
6259,overall i am very pleased with these headphones and recommend them to anyone looking for the same,5
6260,what i like about bluetooth gifting is that if you are like me you've probably noticed that there is a trade off,5
6261,it's been in my wife's car for a while now and it is rock solid,5
6262,very happy and would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive and good basic cover for their phone,5
6263,it was really easy to install the screen protector on the phone before i even walked out the door,5
6264,the travel unit is compact and easily fits into a pocket until it's ready for use,5
6265,and it is clear so you can still see the phone mine in white through the checks,5
6266,the soft outer bit seems more solid and doesn't feel like it will slip out of your hand at all,5
6267,it's quite thin but due to the fact that the moto x uses virtual buttons,5
6268,so far though i think i have used it more than a dozen times i really like it,5
6269,we had flooding over the last week i was able to charge my phone from 0 % to 100 % in 2 hrs 7 minutes,5
6270,i've yet to run into any issues with it and it looks like it is not even there,5
6271,the bottom line is that this is a very good battery at a very good price,5
6272,yes it is bulky but it's only slightly larger than a credit card and only a half an inch thick,5
6273,placing it on a blade so the bottom of the phone just touches the desk when charging,5
6274,been using it for a couple of weeks now but it looks like it will get the job done,5
6275,these are clear and are exactly the right size for my phone perhaps a bit too wide,5
6276,using the 3a output i can charge my nexus 5 and the galaxy 10,5
6277,i have had it for a while now and it's held up very well,5
6278,8226 it only ships with a usb to micro usb cable provided and the charge lasts quite awhile,5
6279,cable worked great and lasted longer than i expected it to for the price,5
6280,a snug but effective fit i expect to have it for a long long time because it's all about durability,5
6281,i received this oxa battery free of charge in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation,5
6282,and best part was that it came with a micro-usb cord and charger,5
6283,used it to cut my sim down for my iphone 5 and it fit well and i love the product,5
6284,i would really recommend this to anyone looking for a good screen protector for their tablet,5
6285,it proves that you do not need to use zune marketplace,5
6286,disclosure i was given a free product in exchange for an honest review,5
6287,ultra power save mode this is a great feature to have when you are out at an event and your battery deplete to soon,5
6288,also you can't just plug it in you have to plug it in and then pressthe button under the four blue leds,5
6289,i use this to charge my ipod and phone at the same time and it saves me space in my outlets,5
6290,i was glad to order this for her and it came in good condition and came on time,5
6291,the product is the same as advertised fits perfectly and it's a great price to boost your phone's antenna,5
6292,it has a heartier miniusb plug than the original at t charger sync cable and not 40,5
6293,bought my daughter an iphone and this does a great job of protecting the phone and looking pretty sleek at the same time,5
6294,i'm very happy with this purchase and and it looks better than the other flip cases that i have bought,5
6295,6a 2a you can charge 2 devices at a time is a big plus,5
6296,i felt this was a iffy purchase because it was so cheap but it's a really good case,5
6297,if you want to have the ability to charge multiple devices at the same time through one outlet,5
6298,first time buying an otterbox and am pleasantly surprised at the quality of amazon-branded device cases,5
6299,just get this one and you won't have to pay for one for your phone,5
6300,this for me meant that i was able to charge my blackberry from drained to full,5
6301,the dual ports are great able to charge my iphone and ipad and worked like a beauty,5
6302,i've been using this phone for about two months now and am extremely happy with it,5
6303,i haven't had this product long i don't think i will since the thing is basically just a pen,5
6304,cover is about indestructible works well has a good grip and does not collect too much dust,5
6305,recently my daughter i got iphones i wanted something that would protect my shiny new nexus 5 and came across this,5
6306,i love the overall aesthetic and so far it has held up well to daily usage for more than three items,5
6307,with a normal use the battery will last a full day of heavy use of the phone,5
6308,i was a little hesitant in purchasing this after reading some of the reviews for this i decided to try it out,5
6309,exactly what i was looking for a case that protects the phone and is also used to secure the phone in holster,5
6310,i recently got a samsung galaxy note 3 and the part that holds the phone in place may be a little too strong,5
6311,it is so nice to have a spare battery to quickly charge or extend the life of your usb chargeable devices,5
6312,the thing i like most is that it holds a charge for a long time and multiple toppings of the headset,5
6313,i also plugged in my ipad and charged it from 70 % to 100 % ends with 3 led lights on3,5
6314,if you're in a crowd people are not going to be taking their phones swimming or driving over them with a car,5
6315,even though it costs 20 more than some of the other protectors i've tried or seen,5
6316,not having the cover over the screen means you don't have to have them on at the same time,5
6317,i was pleasantly surprised that this case is similar to the iphone 4 otterbox reflix series,5
6318,great to have when camping or hiking since you don 8217 t have to worry if the socket is just a little too far away,5
6319,these came in bulk packaging but appear to be identical to the original that came with my phone,5
6320,i would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a fast powerful charger that is dependable,5
6321,it was nice because i felt like i was using macbook macsafe power cable,5
6322,i would have liked the ability to charge both the phone and the battery pack,5
6323,check out the sixth picture down on this product page to see what it sells for and couldn't believe my eyes,5
6324,it is a little heavy but doesnt take away from the sleekness of the phone itself,5
6325,a word of warning you won't be taking this case on and off but it doesn't bother me that much,5
6326,ok maybe not that great but it works fine and i am very pleased with how quick it charges these items,5
6327,i keep one at my desk one in my bag one in the truck and one at my desk,5
6328,it has a very slim profile so it 8217s easy to toss in a bag without a problem,5
6329,theres nothing like otterbox cases this one doesnt add too much bulk but still protects my ipod to the max,5
6330,i haven't had any problems carrying the phone in my pocket or worse just out and around,5
6331,perfect for a quick charge and small enough to put in your pocket and not really feel it,5
6332,if your a guy and you keep your phone in your pocket this case is for you,5
6333,i needed to change to the smaller size ones and it fits perfectly in my hand this holster allowsme to keep it that way,5
6334,love this product i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in protection for their expensive smartphone,5
6335,it will plug into a computer usb port or the battery charger that came with the phone and is obviously an oem product,5
6336,i have used it to charge my kindle fire hd and my wife's phone with no problems,5
6337,i love the way it feels in my hands and is very grippy,5
6338,it definitely adds to the dimensions of the phone but it gives you a sense of pride in your phone,5
6339,i have a regular screen protector on my note 2 and it fits good,5
6340,yes it's not as good as the iphone 4 and on par if not better than the oem battery,5
6341,i like it better than many of the other cases out there but it's actually solid,5
6342,i had this same case for my galaxy sii bought it for 2 phones and installation was about 30 seconds each,5
6343,shipping was very quick and so far i have no complaints and would recommend this purchase to anyone,5
6344,since i needed an extra long usb cable for my iphone really is nice,5
6345,slim and convenient for charging holds it's charge well and is powerful enough to charge a tablet computer,5
6346,the best part is it keeps the camera lens from being scratched up since it raises the lens off the table,5
6347,i also love the bright color so it's easy to find in a dark room,5
6348,best of all their products are usually a fraction of the price compared to buying it in one of the box stores,5
6349,the band goes behind the head but i didn't have any problem with the power button on top,5
6350,this round i was looking for something rugged so i do not have to worry about bubbles with this screen protector,5
6351,i got this compact dual port charger because i spend a lot of time on the phone on a daily basis,5
6352,the tip fits snugly into the phone so that you don't feel like it will fall off when moving around,5
6353,i have had this case now for a few months and it seems to be holding up great,5
6354,it took about 3 weeks to receive but it was well worth the money and i will get more of them,5
6355,i would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a usb car charger this unit fits nicely,5
6356,and i found this so far i don't have to use the bass reducer,5
6357,the case very easily clips over the phone and is a perfect fit for all of the holes and buttons match up perfectly,5
6358,this case arrived before the time given and i have dropped my phone accidentally on my hardwood floor and the case protected it,5
6359,by the way i use it with an iphone 5 and an ipad 3 all worked instantly with no problems,5
6360,slim and has had a few drops with no damage in the last month,5
6361,i purchased this as a gift for a friend and she loves it hasnt taken it off,5
6362,the only drawback to this case is that it takes some time to get use to if you are accustom to using clear protectors,5
6363,i was more than pleased with my older note 2 but this one is very comfortable and holds my phone with no problem,5
6364,i bought together with a fit folio case and you cant even tell its on my iphone but its perfect,5
6365,perfect for going out for a walk when you need a little light to find the right key or the keyhole,5
6366,its always nice to have the mirror just in case you need to write something down on paper,5
6367,great product i can charge my phone and the extra battery fit perfectly,5
6368,i have had my phone and tablet charging on it at the same time and charge my cellphone,5
6369,i just recieved this case a few days ago and i have already had to use it,5
6370,this shield is so easy to apply and it looks good and functions well and offers protection too,5
6371,but that's just a preference and has nothing to do with the screen protector itself more my own inabilities,5
6372,there's an actual on off switch so you don't have to worry about anything touching the camera lens,5
6373,the hard inner case provides stability for the phone so that it was upright rather than laying down on my desk,5
6374,i like that there is a plastic screen protector in addition to the integrated new trent screeen protector and fit is good,5
6375,first of all the samsung vibrant is one of the most powerful on the market and holds a whopping 9000 mah,5
6376,this product is exactly what i was looking for something simple lightweight and with a texture backing,5
6377,overall i think its a great case for people who are looking for a quality universal vehicle mount,5
6378,i have a apple iphone 4s and when i got these i was able to get them out,5
6379,the non skid pads on the bottom and it does the job very well and for that price,5
6380,the slightly raised lip on the face of the phone so that it is not moving around while you are wearing it,5
6381,i bought a new battery for the phone about a year ago and it has not come off yet and it is still clear,5
6382,overall i am pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone who would like to try it,5
6383,fourth because of the back of the neck design you will not be able to pull it down over your ears,5
6384,this cases is really nice it looks just like the one that came with your phone,5
6385,this cover looks great feels great and does what it's supposed to no issues it works and is made very well,5
6386,8226 following a work meeting last week i was able to take high quality photos video,5
6387,love this case and so glad i got it because it came faster than i thought it would,5
6388,all cases should have a slight bead around the face of the phone but it is a tad small,5
6389,as the other reviewer did say the opening for the micro-usb port is also on the back in-between volume,5
6390,a sample of this product was sent to me by the distributor for this review,5
6391,my only problem is that i don't know how to attach it to the battery to prevent it from moving,5
6392,i have used several screen protectors and these seem to be the best dual product for the price that i order,5
6393,it's also very easy to get the phone into the case and then snap the rest of it in by gentle pressure,5
6394,they are rugged and don't tangle quite as bad as some of the others i have had in the past,5
6395,the case is easy to put on as the phone fits into the case like a glove not too tight not too loose,5
6396,the front has a raised edge around the front of the phone that should keep the glass off of surfaces,5
6397,it sends clean nice sounding audio to my car's aux jack with a gold plated audio cable,5
6398,update the built-in screen protector is much better than my old moto,5
6399,stand is a great feature and i've used it many times charging apple android devices simultaneously,5
6400,also the speed this processes everything you do i will be honest and say the phone build is far from super durable,5
6401,after a short tutorial she was able to charge the unit and use a headphone without taking the case off,5
6402,i have only used it for a day so i guess i'd have to say i like everything about this case,5
6403,compared to other screen protectors this was super easy to apply and is just a great item,5
6404,i wouldn't say they would protect it well if dropped but i don't want to mess with opening it up and closing it,5
6405,i had the elago case similar to this for my old phone and it worked well,5
6406,i own the smaller battery pack from anker and it works so well that i haven't been in any super noisy locations lately,5
6407,i'm pretty confident i can get through the day without having to plug in then this is the way to accomplish that,5
6408,i would recommend this product it holds the phone in an upright position and does not charge a spare battery,5
6409,just keep it charged every month toss it in the car and it sounded fantastic without any echo or artificial sounds,5
6410,i have been using this case for a few weeks and it has delivered on both those attributes,5
6411,it's not as sturdy as i was used to but i am sure that will fade away with time,5
6412,i like how it protects my phone i haven't had any problems with it and nfc works too,5
6413,works all the time but once in a while when i know i won't drop my phone,5
6414,this very well constructed charger did a superb and fast job of charging my phone tablet etc as one simple device,5
6415,move the movable contacts to the right side of the phone which is nice too,5
6416,not much more to say about this product other than it works just fine with my samsung galaxy s2,5
6417,shipping was very quick and so far i have no complaints and would buy it again,5
6418,i think the bumps allow you to not have to worry about seeing fingerprints on my screen,5
6419,this is also apple certified so i do not have to worry about laying it down on the face,5
6420,housing a 2000mah battery the case adds virtually no weight to the phone and has a good feel in your hand,5
6421,i wanted an inexpensive case for my work phone and for the price i'm not complaining,5
6422,this will definitely add weight and bulk to your phone but i like that,5
6423,i'd definitely recommend it for anyone who is away from an outlet for a long period of time,5
6424,the option that goes inside my ear fits perfectly and i never worry about it because the otter provides such supreme protection,5
6425,been using for 2 weeks and i haven't had them run out,5
6426,i'll often leave the phone on my desk or in my pocket so for me it's not a make or break option,5
6427,she has had it for over 2 years now and i still love it,5
6428,to me this isn't really an issue for me since that's not my intended use,5
6429,the case wrapped around the back and the sides but not the front,5
6430,i got this case as a gift for my husband and he loves it,5
6431,he's loving it and i would recommend this product hands down to everyone,5
6432,i havent had bluetooth for over 5 years and i decided to go with the gloss and do not regret it,5
6433,the phone feels great in my hand and it feels great,5
6434,i've used the nano to micro sim adapter a couple of times and it fell on asphalt never a crack or malfunction,5
6435,it's a hard case and it's easy to get in and out even with my diztronic form fitting case on it,5
6436,now place the dead battery on the charger at the end of the day never gets below 40 %,5
6437,i really like having the double charger so i can charge two things at once if you carry that additional cable around with you,5
6438,as soon as i got it i put it on my phone then proceeded toaccidentally drop it,5
6439,i highly recommend this case it is a great value and the peace of mind it brings,5
6440,so when shopping for a case to protect my iphone and to get it in a few days,5
6441,enjoyed them while they lasted had no issues with this item and would recommend for anyone,5
6442,i got this for my sister for christmas and it looks good in the car with its nice big buttons,5
6443,it securely holds my note 3 in the case but i feel that if i did it would be protected,5
6444,in my case despite this being a vine choice for me this is not a bad thing as it is a tradeoff,5
6445,i use it whenever i go out and don't want to take it off every day,5
6446,i love how this case is so thin that it can easily fit in my purse to move from car to car,5
6447,little on the tight side but it will loosen up over time so don't over stuff it,5
6448,flash light looks useful as well but i didn't have a brand new oem glass to compare it with,5
6449,this item comes in handy when you need to throw it in your bag or pocket for whenever you need it,5
6450,i like that powerbot chose to use the micro usb interface as it is the most common interface used by android devices today,5
6451,my only qualm is that the buttons are hard to press but i could deal with it,5
6452,the phone seems to be built very well especially considering the low price and it has some great features,5
6453,i like to change my case often and don't want to pay a fortune for unlocked un-subsidized smartphones,5
6454,you can even get the aluminum in a number of different colors but i thought this particular color scheme looked great,5
6455,great battery so far great customer service i'm extremely satisfied with this case and i highly recommend it stay tuned for more updates,5
6456,i'm serious people you get more for your money and a great product,5
6457,this was purchased for an htc evo 4 g and the response is great,5
6458,some times i would have to charge my phone 2-3 times and no problems,5
6459,it comes with two protectors in case you mess up the first one which i did,5
6460,i can get through the day without having to plug in then this is the way to go,5
6461,i love that i don't have to deal with bluetooth and its shortcomings,5
6462,good reception very long battery life even though it's not the best protection but with the rubber on the corners,5
6463,i have not really use the remote so i can not comment on that but i've heard it's satisfactory,5
6464,38 thickand i can confirm that the infuse fits inside this case with the slit about 1 2 open,5
6465,easy to install and definitely worth the peace of mind that your screen isn't going to crack after one drop,5
6466,i can run on the treadmill and not have to worry about turning them off to conserve power,5
6467,what i like about it is the fact that there is a laser pointer as well as the led flashlight,5
6468,audio quality is great i cant tell the difference between this one and apple's overpriced bumper,5
6469,4 i've dropped my phone and it's a protector,5
6470,i really like this feature because most of the time i don't even notice i have them on,5
6471,he loves this and i think i will get a lot of use from this awesome pack,5
6472,the volume buttons are not raised so you do have to push a little harder for the complete click,5
6473,well i bougth this charger because i read all the other reviews and decided to go ahead and order this,5
6474,it fits well though a little tricky to get it to fit just right but it works fine so far,5
6475,i use my htc hd2 24 7 was looking into an extended battery pack for my bike rides,5
6476,thus the e-71 is a product with multiple capabilities that can be used as a speaker base when the speaker is actually being used,5
6477,eventually i caved and purchased it new from a brick and mortar store for three times as much,5
6478,i 8217ve had this case for a few weeks now and have not had any problems,5
6479,cons takes longer to charge than the regular battery but this is to be expected with any type of transparent softgel,5
6480,this is the real oem htc micro usb cable and comes with a 6 inch usb to micro usb cable,5
6481,i like to charge my phone and charge my powerpak ultra at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles,5
6482,i would certainly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good bluetooth,5
6483,i have been using these for a few days now and absolutely love it,5
6484,yes it a little bulky but i've gotten used to it but it is not flimsy at all,5
6485,overall this is a wonderful case that fits the iphone 4 perfectly and provides excellent protection for the iphone,5
6486,the stylus is built very well and i believe it will last a long time without getting loose and 34 floppy 34,5
6487,the extra usb port us useful to charge your phone at the perfect angle is just an added bonus,5
6488,my dad has battery packs and they aren't nearly as bright and flexible as these,5
6489,however i also wanted a case that was attractive and doesn't look like a growth sprouting from your ear,5
6490,i purchased this item as a christmas gift for my dad and he liked it and fits perfectly in the ipad,5
6491,anyway it charged my z1 compact from 35 % battery to 100 % in a little under over two hours while playing ingress,5
6492,it fits perfectly for motorola atrix 4 g and has all the necessary holes for use of the ports and camera,5
6493,the speakers and lighting port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack line up perfectly,5
6494,these batteries last a little longer than the standard samsung battery but not enough to make it hard to open,5
6495,so far i'm impressed and look forward to using it and virgin mobile for a long time,5
6496,only thing is that i ordered the anti-glare anti-fingerprint screen protectors that fit perfectly on my iphone 5c,5
6497,1a 10w charger i used but the mixit comes with a micro-usb cord for if friends need to charge their phones,5
6498,when putting on the case it looked like it wasn't going to fit and i was going to waist my money,5
6499,when not in use the prongs fold into the body of the charger for extra space saving and efficiency,5
6500,fits my iphone 5 like a glove and doesn't look bad at all,5
6501,the retractable point on the trent stylus allows me to keep it in the glove box when not in use,5
6502,this compact power bank is the perfect size to carry in your pocket or purse,5
6503,it doesn't add a ton of bulk to the phone which is good becasue this thing is big enough already,5
6504,after having the case on my phone for a few days but it is better than anticipated,5
6505,it fitted perfect and was easy to get on and off and fits in my dock well,5
6506,i already had one from my samsung phone and it works great on the iphone with an adapter due to different size,5
6507,the only thing worth mentioning is if you have a case on your air it may not fit,5
6508,this case is decent light weight and does the job of protecting the edges of the phone as well as for tactile senses,5
6509,in looking for a car charger for my iphone and this was 7 and added to my super saver shipping,5
6510,if you are wanting a case that still allows you to work your smart phone and take pictures,5
6511,i have a very slim case on my phone and that tends to make it fall off,5
6512,it seems well built and for the price was a great deal,5
6513,the additional time between it and the factory battery that comes with the phone but it's perfectly fine with me,5
6514,i like the looks of the tudia dual port car charger with its two charging ports providing a maximum 2,5
6515,the bezel around the face of the phone but it is a good product,5
6516,so if you use a case and don't want to deal with this please buy your phone from google directly,5
6517,i drive a ton for my job and didn't want to drop and break his phone again,5
6518,i haven't dealt with the warranty so i can't say how good the bass or what decibel something something is,5
6519,although a little heavy for pants pockets it holds a lot of power and can power two devices pretty easily,5
6520,easy to apply and very clear most people can't even tell i have a protector on the phone,5
6521,overall for the money this is a great item to have especially if you are into fitness simple as that,5
6522,i love this speaker the sound quality is great and people on the other end of the line,5
6523,i wanted to purchase this case at the same time i bought an original bumper from google and i compared side by side,5
6524,though my phone isn't a smart phone you need to purchase these,5
6525,overalli couldn't find anything to complain about with this product,5
6526,it was an incredible buy and well worth the money for how it performs,5
6527,i have a spare battery but i do and i use it all the time too it's not just for disasters,5
6528,it is hard to put on if you don't know what nfc is don't worry,5
6529,i can not believe how strong this cover is i put it on my phone without any issues and it looks great,5
6530,the product was exactly as pictured and arrived within the estimated delivery date given was packaged well and arrived in great condition,5
6531,i've only had this for about a week now and it's perfect,5
6532,not many games work with it and to be honest i have only had occasional trouble with it,5
6533,decided to make use of my sprint unlimited plan on a recent road trip and it was very easy to apply,5
6534,just got this neat toy and can not wait to use it for very special events to show off,5
6535,the phone itself is rather plain looking feels great in the hand and it is really nice looking,5
6536,he lifts weights and needed something that would not be in the way of any major buttons or knobs,5
6537,however it works perfect for getting a full day out of it and i've only had it about 3 days,5
6538,i think this would be easy to find because of the color and shape of the cable,5
6539,there's also a lip around the front of the phone to protect it from further chipping,5
6540,was very nice and obviously a legit oem which is always a good thing from amazon and free shipping too,5
6541,oh the charger that comes with it has a nice long cord too,5
6542,also it doesn't take away from the sleekness of the phone itself,5
6543,i was skeptical because of the price but i got it and it was fully charged when was a plus,5
6544,it does everything i want it to do and it doesnt take long,5
6545,i'm a big batman fan so when i saw this case i was instantly drawn to it,5
6546,i did test the dual output options and was able to simultaneously charge my phone and laptop with this backup,5
6547,the only thing i do not like about this is that the case is thin yet appears to protect well,5
6548,i got this case so i could use it and write my unbiased review,5
6549,at that point i would have given it 5 stars if this was different,5
6550,i caught my daughter nervously slinging the phone around a couple of times and it sticks back on like its the first time,5
6551,i can ride in windy conditions and the person on the other end said i was difficult to hear,5
6552,get it if you need a case to protect your phone from dropping it on the ground,5
6553,it is a bit thin but if you want a case for the iphone 4 thats easy to use and provider great network,5
6554,for a bit i was trying to figure out how to put it on my phone,5
6555,when i bought my s4 i was looking for a battery pack that was more durable then most,5
6556,the labeling is embossed into the case but it's a nice blue and it comes with a screen protective film,5
6557,well i believe this is the best headset so far that i have used and i have tested out quite a few of them,5
6558,and are not expensive do i don't need to take the cover off all that often,5
6559,front and back cover was easy to put on and is doing the job i needed it to do and was well worth the cost,5
6560,the tip is a little large takes a little bit to get it to go entirely around the phone,5
6561,at this price i bought 4 more so i don't have to move them around from office to home to auto,5
6562,right now i am charging an ipod an iphone and a backup battery charger all at once,5
6563,took me a while to find a mount for my bike that hold my iphone 5 in place at all angles,5
6564,although it doesn't cover the screen it's a great case for the new htc one m8,5
6565,it does make the phone a bit bulky compared to some other cases but that's the nature of physics and longevity,5
6566,i had this company's case for my galaxy s3 and never had a problem either,5
6567,so you scored yourself a shiny new htc evo 4 g lte and flashing it to another carrier,5
6568,essentially this is a portable charger allowing you to charge up to 2 usb devices at a time,5
6569,as an added benefit it is a perfect fit for my iphone 4 in its sonix case,5
6570,the best i've ever used and i would definitely buy this one again and the price was great,5
6571,this case looks very nice and it is easy to get on and off does the job nicely and isn't too big,5
6572,doesn't get warm charged two devices at the same time and faster with high current 2a,5
6573,this is a very well made device and i would highly recommend it for anyone in need of a good extended battery,5
6574,it is quite difficult to remove and i wouldn't recommend it for that many unless they were slim pieces of paper,5
6575,it can charge both devices at the same time with the two usb slots,5
6576,not sure what the cable tie is for but i guess i will find a need to use its led flashlight capability,5
6577,i have a slight audio discrimination problem which makes it hard for me to get a fingernail under the port cover,5
6578,the people that i called all said that i sounded crystal clear and that there was 0 zero background noise,5
6579,the only thing i would say to keep in mind is that the suction cup only works well on smooth surfaces,5
6580,it's perfect couldn't ask for a better case for my iphone 4,5
6581,it gives enough grip to the phone so that you don't have a charge when you need it try this,5
6582,the hole for the earphone jack but doesn't seem like it's going to go anywhere,5
6583,it does not cover much of the bottom of the phone it won't slide out of your grasp,5
6584,i love the case but i guess i didn't realize that there was a mute function on the control cord,5
6585,so far the batteries are as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone but the provider,5
6586,have not had any issues with it and it looks like it is not even there when using it,5
6587,i do not normally use the phone a lot so this is perfect for him,5
6588,sometimes cases add so much bulk to the phone the phone is still pretty thin with the case on,5
6589,the case is perfect flexible and has a nice look and feel to it,5
6590,if you've not had a bb before it's a good idea to have a second battery on hand for in case situations,5
6591,this is a great case that will protect your phone without making it look like crap,5
6592,picking up an extended battery is recommended for those who don't like purchasing or installing screen protectors separately,5
6593,overall this product is a must for anyone who uses their phone a lot this is a must-have device for any techie,5
6594,it is the best case that i have ever bought for a cellphone tablet,5
6595,i have had this case for over a week now and i use it every day,5
6596,had the same one previously and had to get a new cover but this was an excellent choice,5
6597,the idea of installing it in the bathroom after running the shower on hot,5
6598,been using iphone since the 3 g and looking for a screen protector look no further than belkin,5
6599,this is a great case that gives the most protection you can get but one of the most stylish,5
6600,i prefer this over say an otterbox type because i like my phone to be as slim and light as possible,5
6601,applying the screen protector is very easy to install and remove if necessary,5
6602,this case is great it is super durable and has a great feel to it and didn't seem to be made of cheap material,5
6603,all i can say is this case looks great and fits perfectly with my tech armor screen protector,5
6604,heavy users will be able to get through the day without a dead battery,5
6605,however upon receiving this product i will say that i am very pleased with this accessory,5
6606,pros-fast charging time rubberized surface in one side so it won't slide out of my hand or get stuck in my pocket,5
6607,i've only had this for a couple weeks so far its been great and keeps my phone scratch free,5
6608,i have 7 cases for my phone and this has been a helpful case,5
6609,and as i said before after a while you 8217ll get used to just tapping the screen until the phone responds,5
6610,when charging it charges my phone at about the same rate as the oem one i will be happy,5
6611,there are two usb charging ports to charge the ipad and the iphone at the same time is a big plus,5
6612,so overall i have to say this is probably my favorite,5
6613,however the iphone itself is quite tough so i'm not too worried about that because her customer service was amazing,5
6614,it has a minimal lip that covers the edges of the phone the entire back and camera lens is exposed,5
6615,one minor thing is that the suction is so strong it works without locking it in,5
6616,they were very easy to apply and seem to be as good if not better then our year old original samsung batteries,5
6617,these styluses just blew me away the micro-knit tip does not get damage from your bag,5
6618,also the wind i am out in the field training for weeks at a time in summer heat,5
6619,great price it was for my iphone 4 and i had a few issues with ue 1,5
6620,i have two of these first one was given to me as a gift and i did not purchase it on amazon,5
6621,the battery is quality it lasts the same as the battery that originally came in my phone,5
6622,it does not improve the sound quality of the music is excellent that can blow your mind,5
6623,the case fits my galaxy s4 well and all of the ports are positioned perfectly and work well,5
6624,the charger works with other usb devices and i was able to charge two cell phones very quickly,5
6625,the holster holds the phone securely and the only problem i've had with apple's iphone 4s,5
6626,and finally these are high quality and very well made because it stays on,5
6627,took only 3 days to arrive and it came in perfect condition in its original box with everything,5
6628,i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great screen protector,5
6629,this has to be the greatest screen protector i've ever used and very easy to install apply onto your phone,5
6630,these clear savers are well worth the money and you won't be disappointed with ditztronic cases,5
6631,love the colors and sparkles and its just the right size for my phone and easy to install,5
6632,i've tried several chargers over the last 10 years and this one beats them all,5
6633,in my household i am the exclusive user with a phone and tablet and are on the go,5
6634,you put the phone in the holster and it's durable,5
6635,the case is very nice it fits perfectly on the phone no gaps not hard to get on,5
6636,i've had this bluetooth for over a year now and love it so much that i bought it for my ipod,5
6637,touch screen still works as well as it did when i applied it,5
6638,this charger is exactly like the one i got with my samsung galaxy s4,5
6639,the touch screen is responsive and i've never had problems with broken or sporadic connection problems,5
6640,tried so many screen protectors but this one by far is the most impressive screen protector i've ever used,5
6641,i am sure i will lose the end to it over time but it does show where sacrifices had to be made,5
6642,i picked this case because red is my favorite color and the black really makes it pop,5
6643,her phone lasts all day so i don't have to worry about my daughter dropping her note and destroying it,5
6644,this is just like the one that came with my galaxy s5 at all,5
6645,though you wouldn't want to take it off it is so cute and it is cheap but still sturdy,5
6646,note that the charger does not turn off when it's done charging your gadget or after you unplug it,5
6647,to activate the battery press the button on the top face where the iflash logo is,5
6648,i always get compliments on it and it doesn't take up much space,5
6649,this case is great i use this when i am not using my bluetooth,5
6650,also the idea behind why the buttons are on the back but you get used to it fairly quickly,5
6651,gr8 alternative for a cheap price bought this for my galaxy s3 and was very impressed with the quality the fit was perfect,5
6652,this one is for the iphone 4 so i gave it to my brother and it works perfect in his phone,5
6653,the screen protector is excellent i took it off my phone a couple of time and this case really protects my phone,5
6654,i am learning to turn off the unit when i get out of the car and i didn't know it,5
6655,the description had me wondering if it came with a cable or a somewhat built it cable,5
6656,she said it was a little hard to put on but protects the phone,5
6657,it's just tacky enough i rarely drop my phone and it doesn't seem to be causing any problems,5
6658,i know from experience because i dropped my phone with this case on to my ihome,5
6659,just to let you know i am very happy with this case and with the price,5
6660,i have been using anker batteries for a couple of years now and it still works great,5
6661,clarity this protective plate makes the iphone much much easier to see than the ridiculously microscopic light that the incredible employed,5
6662,i love the fact that i don't have to connect two cables together,5
6663,this headset also includes a feature called vocalyst which i don't see much value in having it on such a large device,5
6664,inexpensive and not as tough to separate as i thought it would be but overall case is nice and works great,5
6665,feels good on your ear and offers good protection for those of us that don't like to use a case,5
6666,the belt clip is rugged and doesn't feel like it will slip out of your hand easily,5
6667,you could safely put your i d and credit card if you don't want to be forced to dive into a second screen protector,5
6668,i was worried about prior to purchasing reading some of the other reviews but relented because of the value,5
6669,this is the only thing i would change about the case itself but i would have preferred it to be a little more angled,5
6670,this takes a while to fully charge the battery pack to 99 %,5
6671,this is the best screen protector i have ever had and no air bubbles,5
6672,far cheaper than the samsung tectiles but the phone doesn't seem to big at least to me,5
6673,cant even see the case on the phone and taking the case off,5
6674,i bought this for my son and he has not complained about it so i guess it is a good buy,5
6675,i find those to be more than sufficient for my work vehicle too,5
6676,i haven't got to use yet but i'm sure it will be just as easy to set up with most other cellphone models,5
6677,this is a great case for my phone and my money and cards,5
6678,0 right onto my television plus it charges my tablet at the same time i give this item a 5 star rating,5
6679,i've had it for over 5 months now and still have no issues,5
6680,there is only one minor flaw and that is that the lock button is on the right side of the bud,5
6681,the case can be a little tough to remove but that's not a big deal and it's comfortable with his glasses on,5
6682,seems very protective yet not too bulky haven't dropped it yet so i can't speak to how it works in that respect,5
6683,this headset is so clear that i can't tell if he's using it or not when he calls,5
6684,this product is hands down the best bluetooth in the world you tell me what is,5
6685,i had never heard of this company but based on other reviews i ordered this u250 from ccmaccessories,5
6686,it's also apple mfi certified which means that you don't have to take the case off to charge it,5
6687,-sound quality audiophiles might realize that there are not a lot of options for protective cases for the nokia 520,5
6688,fits the phone perfect just the right amount of protection to my preferred device,5
6689,i would recommend these screen protectors to anyone who wants to protect his or her phone,5
6690,however the clip rotates so it is very easy to find the button by the case relief,5
6691,only issue i have is the cord is short but other than that it does a great job of protecting the screens,5
6692,with my old band i would have to take the back armor skin off,5
6693,still i would expect this charger to be able to charge an ipad and mobile phone at the same time,5
6694,if i hadn't installed it myself i would have a hard time getting it to stay in my ear,5
6695,i have dropped the phone on concrete and the case took the hit and protected my the phone,5
6696,the call quality is equal to other bluetooth headsets i've owned did not have an indicator and i always guessed,5
6697,i love that this comes with a charger that allows me to charge both my ipod and cell phone at the same time,5
6698,i dropped it on concrete once and there was no damage at all but that's about my limit for scary drops,5
6699,the audio cord is thin and i don't know how i ever lived without it,5
6700,i bought a different stylus that had a way to attach it to a belt belt loop or clip,5
6701,i get so many compliments on it all the time and it don't get lost inside my bag,5
6702,there was only a small scratch on the case the best part of all is that most stores sell this item from 10,5
6703,it goes on the same way as others do and you have to be careful because the front face plate is very fragile,5
6704,instead of a hard polycarbonate shell with a built-in screen protector but comes with an adhesive one,5
6705,it covers the corners and the silver edges of the face of the phone and do not affect the use of the phone,5
6706,i don't have a sim card you will need to get one easyacc has a nice selection on amazon,5
6707,remember that you'll need a battery charger to take full advantage of it's abilities without bridging those pins,5
6708,i bought this and a battery charger for my galaxy s3 and they wanted 40 for one,5
6709,why i like them i love that i can simply place my phone in the case and put it in my hand it was great,5
6710,i dropped it a few times and it has protected the phone quite well even on the roughest of falls,5
6711,we had returned a different one prior to this one and it basically went dead within a few uses,5
6712,i give this case 5 stars because the feeling of the case is a little tough to remove but easy to install,5
6713,this is so smooth i don't even know it's on my ear,5
6714,i was skeptical at first about the galaxy s3 because i was not sure how the pen would make the stylus better,5
6715,i've had the nt70 t for a few months now and while i'm still in love with it,5
6716,several nice expensive case exist for around 40 however if you are looking for a shower speaker than look no further,5
6717,i think this is a great headset and i have used it to charge these items individually and in combination with each other,5
6718,comes with a string so you can put it in the holster so that the screen faces out,5
6719,sound quality is clear on both ends of the conversation at a great price,5
6720,unfortunately one of the stones fell out within the first couple of days but other then that its amazing 9829,5
6721,it protects the phone very well and i haven't had one issue yet,5
6722,protects the phone from basic ware and tear but if you drop your phone frequently this item is not for you,5
6723,it is therefore vital to have something like this in your briefcase or pocketbook,5
6724,i am so glad i bought this and i recommend this to anyone looking for a good iphone case,5
6725,one slight issue for some is that you can not charge your phone on it due to case being too thick,5
6726,in short this phone is the best of the best for the samsung galaxy s3,5
6727,nearly as good as the jawbone at less than half the price this seems to be the same except the branding,5
6728,easy to get on the phone and then cases really won't work with it but over 99 % of them will work just fine,5
6729,ultimate in lazy convenience since now i don't even need to have an extra charger in my car,5
6730,this charger takes the cake having 2 usb ports means that you can get rid of all you other ones,5
6731,the battery is a bit bulky but the phone looks as good as it did when the antenna was outside,5
6732,the phone cover doesn't get in the way of viewing the images on the screen,5
6733,i also had a thunderbolt for a short time but didn't like it so i even ordered another one in a different color,5
6734,compared to the myriad of other cases i owned in the past for various phones and smartphones have been made of silicone,5
6735,it works great and you don't have to look away from the road for a split second here and there,5
6736,the smartphones have been steadily increasing in power over the past few years and this is easily the best in terms of cost features,5
6737,with decent usage i was able to get three days out of it easily before i recharge it,5
6738,fits snug with my sgn3 and i would definitely buy this one again and the price was great,5
6739,the kickstand is suprisingly sturdy and the sides of the case are made of a very thin material and it bends really easily,5
6740,this case is the most comfortable case i've found for the samsung galaxy note 3 battery,5
6741,i did this to create playlists for my phone so i can dress it up like the old barbie dolls,5
6742,i've had it on the dash of my car and provides a good hold on the phone,5
6743,this case is very simple but it protects my iphone like a case should and it was cheap,5
6744,if this unit continues to work as well as it does for the price,5
6745,three usb outputs that provide for charging up to three devices at once depending on what they are,5
6746,have had it on for a couple of months now and i love it to pieces,5
6747,call quality is good and no trouble with quality with your phone in your pocket for 90 minutes it will fully charge it,5
6748,the only issue i have is that i haven't been able to drain the battery in 24 hours,5
6749,thanks for a great product at a great price and would recommend for anyone to buy super durable dtopped my phone several times no problems,5
6750,but since i already had it i decided to try it out as well for my iphone 5s,5
6751,i could not think of anything that would make this case better is if it somehow supported qi charging,5
6752,i would recommend this case if you are looking for a trustworthy protective case get the otterbox defender,5
6753,it's not going to protect the phone like some of the softer cases i have tried,5
6754,i had a teal one before for my iphone 4s and now have it on my 5,5
6755,this screen protector is one of the best that i have seen with auto-correct,5
6756,when you're ready to get out of the car and the cord snapped,5
6757,build qualitywell the good news is that this case is made of good quality materials and def protects my phone,5
6758,if you are looking for a charger that will allow you to charge devices that utilize a micro usb,5
6759,it is designed to hold the note 2 with an extended battery and back cover but no case on,5
6760,works well does not feel like it is going to slip away and hit the floor,5
6761,the anker will give us enough additional juice to fully charge an iphone almost 3 1 2 times,5
6762,they fit snugly protect well but don't add a lot of bulk to this phone because it's already so big,5
6763,if you carry a lot of devices and want to be able to charge 2 devices simultaneously in a car,5
6764,with the two battery she can go through the whole day of moderate use about 4 hours of talk time left,5
6765,i like that it can charge 2 devices at the same time and even power devices while the pack is being charged,5
6766,it looks fantastic easily the best looking case i've ever owned and works perfectly with the lumia 920,5
6767,the battery has two charging ports i was able to charge two iphones at the same time,5
6768,from the get-go i was looking for something simple and clear to show off my pretty new iphone 5,5
6769,the roadster serves as a great bluetooth-to-fm transmitter and i absolutely love it,5
6770,the thing which stands out most about this case is the fact that it is unlocked,5
6771,imho the scala 700 right now is the best bang for the buck when it comes to high current usb chargers,5
6772,very slim and does not add bulk to the phone and it protects it very well from drops,5
6773,the front has a raised edge around the front of the phone sticking out too far,5
6774,once i bought him this he fell in love with it and with the other colours that it came with,5
6775,otterbox doesn't offer a lumia 925 model so i was thrilled to find this sim card at such a low price,5
6776,i have it for about 2 weeks now and i've noticed that the battery doesn't hold a charge,5
6777,one final note i haven't tried the screen protector yet as i use ghost armor for all my devices,5
6778,i've had the nt70 t for a few months now and i am very happy with it,5
6779,the case is a bit thin so i'm not sure how relevant this is any more,5
6780,i have used both for 7 months now and i am very happy with my purchase,5
6781,has a good grip to it which makes it easy to hold unlike glossy finishes which slip out of your hand,5
6782,i've had my case for a few weeks now and am loving it,5
6783,i bought this for my ipad and it's really cute it's silicone and wraps around your case front to back,5
6784,i am also very glad that i am able to charge my s3 from 15 % to 100 %,5
6785,not a whole lot of protection but it fits nicely and looks cool,5
6786,mine has all the openings cut out so i can charge it while it is in my pocket,5
6787,the kick stand is pretty flimsy other than that it's a great case to use to eliminate carrying a purse,5
6788,so bottom line is that i do like the product and have continued to use it,5
6789,it was a little hard to get on and off though,5
6790,we've had it about 2 months now and it is holding up well,5
6791,ive been trough so many cases for the iphone and this one is by far the best,5
6792,30 minutes later after messed around i just wanted to see if this would work for occasional internet in the wild,5
6793,it also makes it easier to get in and out of his pocket without sticking half way in,5
6794,i am still using this case and i will continue to buy them from now on,5
6795,the laza protective case does not interfere with the functionality of the phone and that is great,5
6796,i bought this and 4 other cases at the same time but this is exceeding my expectations,5
6797,once my dyslexia was dealt with the top part of the case is pretty much like any other cable right,5
6798,the main attraction of this poweradd unit is that it comes with a carrying bag so easy to pack,5
6799,fits my moto x perfectly inexpensive 100 % functionality of all buttons and ports and is easy to remove put on,5
6800,it locks firmly into place and doesn't feel like it will fall off when moving around,5
6801,i've used this product a few times so far and the case did not crack or broke,5
6802,bluetooth supporti have the nokia bh-905 bluetooth wireless stereo headphones and i was able to make calls with no problem while charging,5
6803,i like that product this was a gift for a friend's new phone and she loves it,5
6804,it has a nice raised edge so you can set it on your desk without having the cover in the way,5
6805,i bought the first couple of iphones when they first came out and were made made by duracell and energizer,5
6806,love this case and would definitely recommend to anyone who has a samsung mega 6,5
6807,i received this through the amazon vine program and love it so much that i am buying another one for my son's g1,5
6808,purchased 2 of these in different colors and they are so cute and adorable and glittery,5
6809,i have owned an ipod touch for a couple of years and then dropped my phone and it broke,5
6810,at least as good as the oem battery that came with the blackberry,5
6811,it charges my ipad and iphone at the same time and they both charge much quicker than usual,5
6812,everything on the phone can be replaced with another app of your choice to replace how your droid experience is well,5
6813,pulled it out of the delivery package and immediately noticed that it seemed to have more grip in the hands,5
6814,the cover for the case is clear so you can see the orange phone is in chicago bears colors,5
6815,everyone is always asking me where i got it from and how can they get one,5
6816,i have had this on my ipod for over a year now and its been nothing but fantastic,5
6817,so far it has turn out to be a good phone for at least the next 2-3 years,5
6818,easy to install and i am still using the first one i put on has stayed on so well,5
6819,i use these at home and at work to keep my phone charged and ready to use,5
6820,i downloaded a wonderful car mode app and now i can listen to music or youtube without having to plug in headphones,5
6821,i've tried at least a dozen bluetooth headsets and this by far is the best i've ever used,5
6822,chrome finnish samsung lettering on the back of the case assures me that the phone will be protected,5
6823,unlike the superleggera pro the commuter does come with a screen protector but i purchased one separately,5
6824,i've been using this for a while now and i really like it,5
6825,the headband is adjustable and the portion that rests on the top of the ear say below where the volume controls are,5
6826,i have used about 8 different screen protectors over the years and this is the best so far,5
6827,these are as good as the original battery that came in your phone,5
6828,and it is super easy to use simply plug it in and place your phone on it,5
6829,i don't have any problems using it to charge two devices at the same time making it really convienent,5
6830,i bought these for my daughter's phone and so far it has protected it,5
6831,seidio fixed that little oversite by including an adapter so you can use all the galaxy phones with mhl enabled hardware,5
6832,it also had some basic instructions on the back of the card to stick it to your battery,5
6833,sometime in the afternoon or early evening the mophie juice pack air battery as the iphone battery is already fully charged,5
6834,the speaker guard panel has a good feel to it all for cheap price,5
6835,i bought this for my mom for her iphone 4s and she loves it got it for her birthday,5
6836,i often need to charge it in the car using the standard usb connection,5
6837,the product arrived as described i was very pleased with my purchase and i would highly recommend this to any iphone owner,5
6838,however i just snap it on when i'm gon na be around water just in case because you never know,5
6839,well this oasis is more comfortable for all day wear but it's not nearly as bulky as the defender series,5
6840,one hard piece is for the front of your phone without opening a cover,5
6841,after having the otterbox for a week the phone has done a great job protecting it from drops and falls onto cement,5
6842,it keeps it charge for about a day and a half before i need to charge it again,5
6843,he said its great it does its job and its nice to have the extra length to charge my phone,5
6844,some things are really knockoffs but this is really a quality case and one that has great feel and appearance,5
6845,i received a sample of this product in order to review it and give my honest opinion feedback,5
6846,it really could be a bit dimmer you don't need to be an origami expert to do so,5
6847,hi all tried many cases but this one is by far the best case i've found so far,5
6848,speaking of seamless i got a phone call while listening to music is just one button click away,5
6849,it works no loose connections issues it does what it was intended to do and i had no problem recieving it,5
6850,all the buttons are easily accessible and the case doesn't interfere with it at all,5
6851,update we have used these skins for a couple of months now and i love it to pieces,5
6852,so this meets and exceeds my expectations for a unit this size and it has very good bass,5
6853,love that i can listen to music while working out at the gym,5
6854,the hipe took a little over an hour to charge from 50 % to 100 % in about 2 hours,5
6855,i use it for a kindle reader so i don't mind having to replace them once in a while,5
6856,they work well for me and i'm quite pleased with the electromaster brand silicone case for my optimus v,5
6857,it's nicely adjustable and i'm using it with a samsung galaxy s3 and it works great,5
6858,it fit my droid 3 perfectly but i had to take off the case i use on the phone to fit in this armband,5
6859,the stock phone comes with an 8 gb micro sd card in mine and it works perfectly,5
6860,i choose not to use it and have yet to have a screen crack from dropping it,5
6861,cons the only con that i have is that it takes a long time to ship but they work great,5
6862,if i'm hanging out at the water i really don't want to get the plug bent when thrown into your bag,5
6863,i have two of these one for each of the cars,5
6864,all of my cables will work with multiple devices and aren't going to be able to use it with usb storage devices,5
6865,these have been a great addition to my life i have been using it for 3 months or so,5
6866,i got this kindle cover in a few days ago and it's great for the price,5
6867,it's very light but does exactly what i need it to do which is to allow me to charge two devices simultaneously,5
6868,there's no blur and it doesn't take away from the quality it doesn't make the case feel bulky,5
6869,nothing feels out of place or interferes with the function of the phone and the dual case really protects the phone,5
6870,3 screen that is vivid clear and easy to read and i don't want a hassle,5
6871,it protects the phone great and doesn't add bulk to the phone so it's pretty unobtrusive,5
6872,i haven't really used the hands-free calling feature and i was amazed at the quality and details,5
6873,i'm very happy with this case and it is cosmetically unscathed,5
6874,battery life is better than the htc inspire and as good or better than all the comparable models out there i've tried,5
6875,they provide great phone protection and it's not bulky at all but still offers protection,5
6876,lacking the means and expertise to do so i was not able to review the microphone button for my review,5
6877,ive had one on my phone for a week or so i'm not sure i should complain,5
6878,i love the hot pink and it protects my phone very nicely ill recommend it for work usage,5
6879,it is a very simple product that does what it suppose to do fits the phone perfect right product was ordered,5
6880,the charger lives in the bottom of my purse and doesn't add any unnecessary bulk to the size of the phone itself,5
6881,one of the things i didn't like about this case was that the color does not match what is displayed online,5
6882,i also like that it put's out enough power to charge my phone 3 times and a little more whithout recharging this battery,5
6883,i have a jell cover so i don't have a long cable getting tangle with other things,5
6884,ultra clear i can't even tell it's there as it is comfortable and secure,5
6885,i am very pleased with this product and will buy from them again,5
6886,fits and works well with my samsung galaxy note 3 and keep it exactly where i want it,5
6887,i would recommend this if you're looking for a case that is slim and can easily slide in and out of a pocket,5
6888,my kindle is always in need of a charge but it's still really useful,5
6889,but if you want to protect your iphone from falls and bumps this is the case for you and it is stylish,5
6890,put it on without any problems comes with everything you need to use is including a 3,5
6891,she loves it and has been using it for over a year and it still works like the day i got it,5
6892,love my case very nice heavy duty rubber i like the way it fits over the button controls on the phone,5
6893,one thing that we really like about this is that it is difficult to see how much voltage each slot is,5
6894,pros 1 protection for your iphone 4 4s protection when you drop your phone and this provides great protection in a small size,5
6895,fits tightly around the edge of the phone and the back slides off,5
6896,so it is impractical to remove the case every time you want to sync it with a normal lightning cable,5
6897,very happy with it though you get used to it and it's not a huge deal one way or the other,5
6898,figured the samsung s4 should have a protector due to the size of the power bank is 4 x 1,5
6899,and here is the one thing that i dont like about this product is that it prevents fingerprints,5
6900,it's a little tight fit so if you have a spare battery to charge and keep in ready state,5
6901,works well in my truck especially when the key is turned off the power plugs also turn off,5
6902,the case fits very well and it's easy on and off because i bought this in gold and silver,5
6903,it just keeps getting better and better and i have not had a reason to contact the seller for any reasons yet,5
6904,also another whole on the flip part to be able to turn the ringer up and down manually again,5
6905,no dice i'm telling you once you get used to the size you'll have a hard time going back,5
6906,it's perfect for my iphone 4 and i had a few issues with ue 1,5
6907,i had to return due to the fact that i have a wallet and a phone case this fits in those categories,5
6908,either way it does it's job and it feels secure,5
6909,on the left side is the on off switch and the feel of the phone too much,5
6910,get one if you do not want to be dropping it,5
6911,other than that this is a rugged case and has held up very well and he likes the look of it and the colors,5
6912,15sep2012 i have had this phone for about 7 months now and i am completely happy with them,5
6913,i'm very careful with my electronics but after getting this case i haven't had not one mishap since,5
6914,it doesn't dim the display at all as far as i can tell keys pavement and coins didn't really damage it,5
6915,i'm a bit fumbly with my phone and i've dropped it and the case holds the phone really well with no damage,5
6916,i took some fine sandpaper placed it flat on a table and not worry about the screen,5
6917,works and looks just like the battery that came with the phone and when fully charged take it out from charger,5
6918,-i have purchased these in the past and dropped my phone several times when a call comes in when i'm sleeping,5
6919,easy installation and i have dropped my phone plenty of times and this case keeps it safe,5
6920,i have a bad habit of dropping my phone and this did a good job protecting it too,5
6921,to make it even better when you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens,5
6922,then before you remove the first protective film lay the protector on the phone and i have 5 extras to spare,5
6923,which i never complained about since it makes me feel like the phone is sturdier and won't slip out of your hand,5
6924,this case is snug protects the phone like a charm and is highly resistant to drops,5
6925,the only thing i can say this is by far the best phone i have ever used,5
6926,the material is sturdy and all the buttons are easy to press and fits in my pockets very well,5
6927,have been using it for a little over a month and i have to say i'm very happy with amazon shipping,5
6928,i was afraid i would have a hard time getting it out of the leather case,5
6929,cover fitted perfectly the battery isbetter than the oem one that came with the phone you can just plug it in anyway,5
6930,the tiny styli have a plastic plug so that you can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone usb charger,5
6931,i've tried many phone cradles over the past few years and none have ever given more the minimumal call quality,5
6932,there is a bevel on the screen side so you can put your phone face-down without scratching the front,5
6933,replaced the oem battery with this one and it works just as well as and looks just like my original battery,5
6934,i use these at the gym and i have no problem with it as it is very useful,5
6935,in terms of performance i was able to fully charge my iphone 4s to 98 %,5
6936,i purchased the solid white case for my white phone and it looks great,5
6937,this is the first external battery i've used and i've tried many and still come back to it,5
6938,they are sturdy keep the phone clean and do an excellent job of protecting your phone as well as being very discreet,5
6939,i figured out sliding my thumbs from one side to the other charging my device or syncing files amazing,5
6940,this was a x-mas gift for my mom and she loved it and it has held up very well,5
6941,i got one of these pig tales and i am now able to charge 3 devices at once and two of them can be tablets,5
6942,the cable that is supplied is not the one that comes with the phone snaps on nice n tight looks clean,5
6943,it displays the amount of power remaining in the battery i found that to be a bit awkward at times but i like it,5
6944,it has an indicator light to show that it is plugged in and ready to go and it really reduces the clutter as well,5
6945,it's not too snug and i can get my phone into it without taking the case off,5
6946,no interference whatsoever no problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo wally world receiver adapter is just a happy marriage,5
6947,ordered the note after doing a lot of research and trying out and returning phones,5
6948,almost every case i've tried adds too much bulk to the phone but seems tough enough to withstand a couple easy falls,5
6949,all of these sounded amazing considering the size of this thing it is tiny,5
6950,i haven't had a single complaint about people not being able to hear me where i did with my other bluetooths,5
6951,i think the light really adds a sleek look to it and blends well with the black of his phone,5
6952,there are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen so you can see how much power you have left,5
6953,it's a good looking case and it protects the phone very well all the way around,5
6954,the arm strap is elastic which means you don't have to press as hard on the icons,5
6955,the only thing i didn't like was that when it is plugged in to charge itself,5
6956,it's also the lightest one i've used and it's only 20 that's pretty incredible,5
6957,also from the headphone you can turn the volume up or down on the top left and right,5
6958,the sides of the case are slightly raised above the face of the screen helping protect it should you turn it over,5
6959,considering all the reviews already posted there's not a lot i can add to the glowing reviews for this tablet,5
6960,this device works so well that i bought a second one for a family member and i would recommend anyone to buy this product,5
6961,having the 2 charging ports is great i don't have to worry about a dead tablet or phone again,5
6962,if i do have a problem i'll update this review but so far this is an incredible deal given htc's price of 24,5
6963,i have the red one as well and the only downfall to this case is if you need to take your batter out,5
6964,sound quality for phone and radio music the sound quality is very good and the length is perfect for my desk,5
6965,it charged my ipad mini and my iphone both at the same time using both usb ports 1 amp android and 2,5
6966,one of my favorite things is i can lay the phone flat down and my glass face does not get scratched,5
6967,i just recently purchased this product and so far i am very happy with this,5
6968,i think this is one of the better cases i ordered last month,5
6969,the day i brought this in everyone was amazed by the quality of the sound not great with a lot of echo,5
6970,i have a lumia 1520 which is almost the size of a cell phone is very powerful,5
6971,it's a really useful device and would recommend it to anyone even a seasoned music lover,5
6972,i have had this case for some time now and i'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone,5
6973,unlike the first case i purchased for my iphone 5 close to release day,5
6974,for the price this is a great way to protect your phone with style,5
6975,like so many of us i travel a great deal and it will serve as my traveling charger,5
6976,as i go through my day i use my phone a lot more now than my tablets,5
6977,much slimmer than the old otter box and it works great with the super low cost battery i got as well,5
6978,after purchasing and reviewing well over a dozen cases for my iphone 5 before finding this one,5
6979,a perfect case and highly recommended if you have a samsung galaxy nexus you need this battery,5
6980,my 19 year old daughter loves this case and it protects the phone and it is attractive but not too flashy,5
6981,i would recommend this product to anyone looking for portable power on the go,5
6982,i got this case for my wife and when i put it on the table next to me at a meeting,5
6983,i placed this on my phone without a screen protector but always have to sacrifice screen scratching,5
6984,i have been using this batter for just over a month and i'm so glad i got it,5
6985,i have had so many compliments on it and it so comes in handy,5
6986,to give an idea of the kind of battery life i haven't seen since feature phones,5
6987,the pen rides very smooth over the surface and you don't have to see them to push them,5
6988,i personally don't like screen protectors so i can't comment on the dashboard installation problems others have encountered,5
6989,they love it and from what i've seen in discussions and on forums,5
6990,this is the best case that i've had so far and it looks good in the package,5
6991,down side is while outside taking pictures you can't see the screen if you're standing behind or beside me,5
6992,i like that as i leave it in my pocket most of the time except looking to check my miles,5
6993,the battery is like three batteries glued together large and it fits the phone and the extra grip it gives you,5
6994,i've had this battery now for several weeks and it is definitely better than a scratch you can't repair,5
6995,it really allows you to keep the small form factor of the battery pack was suprizing though,5
6996,can i just say that this case is one of the better ones for the price,5
6997,battery life seems good and i'm not sure but it's something you should be aware of,5
6998,i have one in my car so i don't have to pay apple prices to replace it,5
6999,otherwise the body armor is fantastic and i would recommend them to anyone with a samsung galaxy iv,5
7000,if you need protection and you dont want to have the battery attached,5
7001,since it has a handle on it i don't have to hide the beauty that is the htc one,5
7002,it still has the problem with not being able to use any of the volume or lock buttons,5
7003,it can almost increase the use time on my samsung galaxy note ii that i got back in december,5
7004,it paired easily with my smartphone and comes with a charging cable and two tips micro usb and ipad,5
7005,the product came in the mail picture perfect and i felt like i was going to break the input some how,5
7006,i love a good bluetooth speaker and i am happy to say that this device worked better then expected,5
7007,its a little slow since its charging 2 devices at the same time and faster with high current 2a,5
7008,this way i have mine and i don't have to worry about the car battery,5
7009,up until that point i've dropped the phone several times and the case stays intact,5
7010,the screen looks great through it and it doesn't seem to effect touchscreen sensitivity all that much neither,5
7011,these batteries last longer than the oem ones and the charger is better quality than i thought it would be,5
7012,i love the extra length so you don't have to worry about running out of electricity,5
7013,this 10000mah battery pack can charge up two devices at once but i am confident it will work great,5
7014,i own several cases for my phone and this is by far my favorite case to date,5
7015,for the money you aren't going to find a better case for the galaxy s3 than this one,5
7016,its safer to use and its makes it easier to hold for long periods of time necessary for my reddit habit,5
7017,install the new adhesive 34 gasket 34 around the edge of the phone and will mess up most screen protectors,5
7018,this is the perfect charger for your blackberry because it serves as a wall charger while it charges it's own internal battery,5
7019,i ordered this for my daughter's friend and she loved it i will recommend to others,5
7020,it was expensive for what it is but i am happy with the clear one,5
7021,my phone looks brand new when i take it out of my pocket and pop it on the mount,5
7022,important to note that the usb charger will take a very long time after the first one its greatly improved,5
7023,now i am safer in that i don't have to keep bringing one with me,5
7024,as long as it does what it says and i really like the design,5
7025,these are very easy to put on take off and they are really cute on my ipad i will be buying more soon,5
7026,i was so upset til i found this one on amazon for cheaper in a sealed package,5
7027,other then those two facts it doesn't take away from the design of the phone and does not turn it into a bulky brick,5
7028,upon unboxing the 34 pulse 34 battery pack sent from maxboost as a free sample so that i could test and then review,5
7029,i've had it for about a week or so and it was filthy,5
7030,it is a little large to carry in a pocket so i was looking for something sturdy effective and that still looked pretty good,5
7031,i do occasionally play games on my iphone 4 and the are awesome for the price,5
7032,only con is that the on off button is on the right side of the phone,5
7033,the color was exactly the same as the original one that came in the box with my blackberry,5
7034,as you may expect i charge my 855 when i'm not using it and it'll go all day,5
7035,update 10 27 after posting my initial review i was contacted by phone by a rep for skinomi,5
7036,i bought this for my galaxy s3 and it works great with both,5
7037,crystal clear non-rubberized material and really thin and you can barely tell that you have anything on your phone screen,5
7038,the strategically designed circuit will prevent over-heating over-charging over-current protection is built in,5
7039,i love the casing but the only problem is that i always forget where i put my phone,5
7040,i would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a fast powerful charger that is dependable,5
7041,have had the case for several months and i am please with the product and would not only recommend it but the seller as well,5
7042,i chose the new trent travelpak plus 7000 mah with built-in ac wall chargernew trent travelpak plus 7000mah 5v 3,5
7043,charging the powerpak takes a few hours but it stays charged for a long time without ever running the car days weeks,5
7044,for a product with such a simple use i was really impressed with the simple application and the finish look,5
7045,i've been using these for a few months now and it works perfect,5
7046,love this case for my iphone 4s because i like to switch my cases out often and this one is great for that,5
7047,bought this one as i don't need to use it just use the cable that came with your phone or tablet,5
7048,i love the colors and the price was a good factor,5
7049,this is the one thing that i dont like about this product is that it comes with a detachable led flashlight module,5
7050,i gave it a good workout charging my kindle fire hd 7 34 to listen to music wirelessly,5
7051,they all initially had the red led and was able to successfully charge my nexus 7 2013 running android 4,5
7052,i've used it as a data cable to the computer as well as sync my calendar events and agendas,5
7053,seems to be doing the protective job it's supposed to do and looks good while it's at it,5
7054,this is not an otterbox so don't expect it to be effective with that device,5
7055,it even works with my gsm galaxy nexus so i came back to buy another case and i bought this one,5
7056,i'd recommend it to anyone who is in the market for new smartphone,5
7057,this is a great phone i have been very happy with the mount and wish i'd found this one first,5
7058,it has a plastic cover that is built in to the speaker you also get a 3,5
7059,once applied it's hard to tell there is even a screen protector on the phone at all,5
7060,its great results for me overall and i'm hoping it will fit as some have said,5
7061,but the devices are already a little big so the last thing you want is add more unnecessary bulk to the device,5
7062,and it's less than a third of the cost of other verizon chargers i have seen,5
7063,i think this package deal is a must have for anyone with a note 3 and or a samsung galaxy s5,5
7064,it seems to begood enough to protect the phone if it goes crashing down on concrete,5
7065,i bought just the screen protector for my iphone 5s and i must say they look great and work as advertised,5
7066,it is bulky which is good because i know that if i drop my phone it will be covered with the case,5
7067,bought this years ago and never reviewed it but i used it for a long time or had too many apps running,5
7068,it takes the mini-usb plug so you don't have to sit so close to a wall outlet while charging,5
7069,i've had the case for about a year now and it has saved my phone from a lot of spills,5
7070,my original just dumped on me so i bought this as a replacement for another kind i already owned,5
7071,it was easy to put on the phone and it is easy to take off and put back on,5
7072,it arrived in on piece i use it for my samsung galaxy s2 very fest i love iti recommended to buy,5
7073,when i went to order this case it was on back order so i had to wait 5 days,5
7074,the case looks exactly like in the picture it's super cute and it protcts my phone enough,5
7075,the battery came with an almost full charge so i played with it for a little while i must say that this case exceeds expectations,5
7076,got this for a spare and it works just as well taking calls as it does playing music,5
7077,this is a really excellent tpu case and it looks great on the either one of the iphone colors,5
7078,while not an audiophile to my ears the audio quality is very good and it works with no problems can't complain,5
7079,on the other hand if you don't intend to use this as a phone protective case inside a larger bag,5
7080,what i loved about it was the fact that it came with an additional cord puts it way ahead of other ipad covers,5
7081,this screen has been installed in my phone for about a month and no peeling had occurred,5
7082,the kit came with everything i needed to charge my samsung phone while traveling,5
7083,as i've stated in similar reviews it's great to have a quality product at a good price that works well,5
7084,i received it and was very happy with the performance of the battery pack on this phone,5
7085,actions speak louder than words i'm going to be buying it in more colors pretty soon,5
7086,i love this case i have dropped my phone a few times so just what i need,5
7087,i 8217ve been using this battery case for a couple of months now with no problems,5
7088,put it in an otterbox case for protection and haven't had an issue yet were it has fallen off my suv,5
7089,i use this mainly when i travel so i wont have to try and keep up with it,5
7090,it is awesome i have dropped my phone a few times and the screen protector has not even scratched,5
7091,then i got this and i am happy to announce i tested this on my iphone 4s,5
7092,i have arthritis in my hands and this case makes it very easy to put it on or take it off if i need,5
7093,bought the 3-pack but have only used one so far and i feel like it was pure luck,5
7094,heh go figure a fully functional computer in the palm of my hand and i have no worries about that with the great grip design,5
7095,want it faster and easier if you have a lot of gadgets that use these cords,5
7096,i have had many assorted bluetooth headsets in the past but this one has been pretty nice,5
7097,the charger itself is small enough to fit in your pocket but just barely,5
7098,6 ft is a good length i'll be able to use a lightning to 30 pin charging adapter with it though,5
7099,the fit to the phone is great and it doesn't add much bulk to the phone and fits perfect,5
7100,i have quite a few easyacc accessory items and i can say that i have never been displeased with something that they put out,5
7101,it's weird to get so excited about a screen protector but these are just as good if not better,5
7102,he told me this was one of the best products i've ever purchased from amazon,5
7103,the lip of the case slightly protrudes the front of the phone so you'd better get a screen protector,5
7104,once paired the ring turns blue and you can easily tell it was used which happen to me,5
7105,it take two hands to put the phone in the holder and squeeze the brackets closed,5
7106,i can still slip it in and out of my pocket with ease,5
7107,this little powergen external battery pack is very powerful for its size and the bluetooth connectivity is excellent,5
7108,the case is light and doesn't bulk up the phone and it totally protects it,5
7109,this is an excellent case cover for the samsung galaxy s3 very fast service,5
7110,i love this cable and recommend it highly to anyone who doesn't mind the extra bulk,5
7111,b build quality is good it's very easy to set up just plug in the supplied 2,5
7112,this is so easy to install i keep it in the glove box when i don't need it,5
7113,update 7 18 i've raised my rating to 5 stars because now the consumer knows what they are getting,5
7114,the 4 color charge indicator gives you a good indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up,5
7115,word is it's waterproof to 3 feet but i don't want to leave it on all the time,5
7116,i'm hard on phones and i've had this for several weeks now and absolutely love it,5
7117,it's not slippery at all and yet it slides in and out of my pant pocket easily without snagging,5
7118,it works really well for charging my galaxy note 3 and my lg tablet at the same time very quickly,5
7119,this case leaves the ports and dock connector exposed in just the right way so as to bring up the clock interface,5
7120,clearly its a cheap purchase but ive been using it for almost a month now and i love it,5
7121,it is nicely rubberized which gives it a nice grip and doesn't make it too much bigger,5
7122,very form fitting accentuating the design of the iphone 5 and this case doesn't do that,5
7123,i have dropped the phone multiple times and the case has done a great job in protecting my iphone,5
7124,overall it is a breeze to set up and i use it every day so the battery life is great,5
7125,i wish spigen produced their own holster but for now this is the best smart watch by far in this current first generation,5
7126,it allows for convenient charging and i don't need to hard dock mount my android,5
7127,this case provides a rim along the screen to protect it when if it falls on the screen side,5
7128,form factor is great for docking stations didn't have to take the case off when you synch it to the computer,5
7129,instead of wallet purse phone ughh the hassle i love the colors and the size fit perfect in my purse,5
7130,works great and i love the fact that there is a small red light when plugged in,5
7131,this is a great a back up just in case something happens to my main case,5
7132,just as described and much better than the one that i got in retail store,5
7133,i have had the same protector on for months now and it is showing no signs of any wear n tear,5
7134,the note 3 is an expensive phone and you want a case that will protect the blackberry curve 8520 this is it,5
7135,this case is so cute i love the way it looks on my phone and hopefully a better idea of the coloring,5
7136,the twin usb ports allow me to charge my cell phone whenever i go,5
7137,once i got it the way i wanted the air bubbles were easy to eliminate and they feel super smooth,5
7138,this is the best screen protector that i've ever used and also the most flexible,5
7139,what i like is that this battery is exactly the same as the one on the picture but it does fit,5
7140,the fit around the buttons is just fine and i have no trouble with the connection ports lining up,5
7141,it works fine with my case and also holds the phone at a good angle or some sort of dashboard mount,5
7142,i can honestly say that i am extremely pleased with this phone and highly recommend it to anyone,5
7143,but according to my husband the real beauty of it is that it can be used with two different phones without re-pairing,5
7144,i would have been able to keep my phone charged and i didn't want to keep carrying around multiple chargers,5
7145,when the phone rings and i have to dig around in the bottom of my purse it's never come open by itself,5
7146,it only covers the back so you will want to get a screen protector but the otterbox has no screen cover either,5
7147,if needed i can plug in both at the same time or mixed results when they claim they can,5
7148,i and my family have a lot of usb powered devices then this is your solution,5
7149,i have read results that say that it really doesn't work so well for the htc g2,5
7150,this is a great silver metal looking case and it looks great on the phone and it does make it thicker but any case will,5
7151,i bought several other aftermarket ear peices gel inserts and at the end of the trip i still had around 15 % battery left,5
7152,this is by far the best bluetooth headset i've ever owned it is so comfortable that i sometimes forget i am wearing it,5
7153,when i'm at home i also have the new trent imp120d 12000mah and i can say with certainty that it is not that difficult,5
7154,in a pinch you can also charge your phone at the same rate as the s3,5
7155,microphone pinhole diameter the little hole on the other side of the line will hear lots of wind,5
7156,i have been searching for a perfect glass screen protector for my iphone 5s and bought this one for my wife and it's great,5
7157,google music and other players easily identify album art even if you don't have a pretty tight grip on it,5
7158,finally this one fits perfectly and the buttons are still easy to push down,5
7159,but i still love it and it's my everyday case,5
7160,they come with lanyards but for tablets that can get in the way of a great handheld experience,5
7161,the clear covers were not included but i don't think i paid more than 40 for it,5
7162,we live in very northern minnesota and spend a lot of time outdoors and not having to be plugged into a power source,5
7163,the thing i like the most is the fact that it does not block neither the cameras microphones or other needed items,5
7164,one side has the power cable port and the other side has outlets for two different devices,5
7165,haven't had the separation issue yet but if i do i feel comfortable with this case on it,5
7166,i do recommend to anyone looking for a good windshield mount,5
7167,i have had bad experiences with previous styluses but for the price it was worth the wait for these to ship from hong kong,5
7168,this case does what you need it to do which is to allow me to charge two devices at once,5
7169,edit again i ordered a second pouch and i did not get the annoying apple message that this accessory is incompatible,5
7170,for one it was the easiest screen protector installation i have ever had the pleasure of owning,5
7171,i mostly use it when i'm on the go with no charger around,5
7172,i have to say i'm very impressed with this motorola headset and would highly recommend it,5
7173,have been using it for a few days and i'm impressed with the quality of this battery,5
7174,that's true but i have no problem pushing the buttons and i am able to easily remove it if needed,5
7175,i learned to have extra cos the one i got with my original droidx battery and it seems genuine,5
7176,i have had several iphones for a few years and i'm sure this one will too,5
7177,putting it to use the case feels really good in your hand and it also fits the phone very nicely,5
7178,but once it is on this cover is much better than the one came with the phone,5
7179,i was provided a sample of this product for my honest feedback and evaluation,5
7180,there has been some complaint about people not being able to hear me and it's very comfortable to wear,5
7181,i've recommended this to my friend and between the two of us we now have 3 of these and no complaints,5
7182,there are a lot of videos on youtube that show you step by step how to set it up,5
7183,the only think i dont like about this product is that it is well made and serves a good purpose,5
7184,when i use it to charge my ipad and iphone and this charger will do both my 10,5
7185,i've had it for a week now and it's holding up really great,5
7186,6 stars as i took off some because of the fact that i have to do a finger workout when i use it,5
7187,it does not interfere with any of the buttons speakers and is easy to get on and take off,5
7188,all cases should have a slight bead around the face of the phone to make me feel confident if dropped,5
7189,these are exactly like the buds that came with my galaxy phone messed up and was too short,5
7190,it has no buttons and only a mini usb port for charging as well as firmware updates,5
7191,if you are debating between devices this is the best on the market and we will not go anywhere without it,5
7192,i use it to charge and sync my phone with the case on,5
7193,i've been using this phone for about a week now and must say that i am happy with the outcome of this purchase,5
7194,it has never came lose or out of the case and i don't see it breaking down over time like other cases,5
7195,when you need this cord then you can't beat the value you get with this bundle,5
7196,i read the reviews on here and that is what sold me on it and i have not been disappointed,5
7197,the charger has the same connection as my htc evo 4 g is monster when it come to battery consumption,5
7198,the input and output specifications labeled on the side of the device to indicate the correct port,5
7199,i put it on without taking the case apart and i've had no issues in the week i used them,5
7200,with all the overpriced options out there you can not go wrong with this backup battery charger if you have an iphone,5
7201,also this one for the iphone 5 unlike the one for the iphone 4 is great and lets the retina display shine through,5
7202,it's slim enough that it slides in and out of my pockets and purse without grabbing the cloth lining,5
7203,with a 10 000 mah battery pack you can charge an iphone 5s at about a 96 % of a full charge,5
7204,if you have a evo then you know why its a good idea to get several and change them once in a while,5
7205,you have to be very patient and precise but the effort is well worth the benefit of protecting the phone,5
7206,i could rely on the case to protect my phone and it does just that,5
7207,this bluetooth is very good perform battery time is very good and it was shipped fast something i always appreciate,5
7208,this cradle was purchased for a samsung galaxy s2 epic 4 g touch and this product works great with it,5
7209,the device was very easy to pair with my phone samsung galaxy nexus rather than the dock,5
7210,it sticks out far enough from your phone to protect the screen if it lands or is set on its face,5
7211,it's such a relief to have a car charger with two usb ports but it appears afterwards i did not,5
7212,i received my case for my phone and i am glad that nokia is back,5
7213,i have not had any complaints about people not being able to hear me where i did with my other bluetooths,5
7214,i've dropped my phone with this case on so i don't need to bother,5
7215,everyone that has seen it thinks it is a great cover for iphone owners with small children,5
7216,granted this case is not designed to protect the phone from scratches and a small drops,5
7217,i've been using this mount for a few weeks and i have to say i'm very happy with amazon shipping,5
7218,i love hello kitty and i love this phone case i bought it for my sister,5
7219,also since my initial review i have had a chance to wear these extensively and in different situations,5
7220,in all honesty i wasn't sure how i was going to keep it secure on my daily adventures,5
7221,if you decide to move the mat it's easy enough to remove the case if you're using a lighting to 30 pin adapter,5
7222,it 8217s both attractive and functional which is more than i can say for any other headset i have tried,5
7223,i bought this sleeve because i don't have a data plan and didn't want to sign a new contract,5
7224,i've noticed that this charges my iphone 5 faster than either of the previous chargers did,5
7225,they work just as well and last just as long as the stock battery and came fully pre-charged,5
7226,i'm a guy and i carry my phone in my pocket and it never misses a beat,5
7227,i read another review that states that it would be nice to be able to purchase the bumper part in other colors,5
7228,but every time i want to look at my phone case after getting this,5
7229,but because i am using a big protective case it is a tight fit and does not just fall out of the iphone port,5
7230,the phone fits perfectly in this case and in my opinion it is perfect,5
7231,bought this for my old iphone so i knew i wouldn't have a problem with it yet its actually like perfect as the original,5
7232,that puts this battery as approximately 20 % more battery life than stock for my tmobile galaxy s2 which is awesome,5
7233,my son really likes them so i bought a second pair for a friend after hearing the sound quality,5
7234,my husband did this for me and it works to charge my ipad and my iphone and it worked perfectly,5
7235,but it seems quite durable i've been using this for about 3 months and it hasn't failed me yet,5
7236,i think this case is durable and i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new iphone 4 4s case,5
7237,the case has a nice smooth feel so sliding it out of your pocket is like sliding a hot knife through butter,5
7238,i like the material too because it doesn't get stuck in my pockets when trying to get to my phone,5
7239,was apprehensive at first to order but am so pleased with the quality of the speaker it sounds good for the purpose,5
7240,i usually have to charge my phone 3 or 4 times and there is no sign of damage,5
7241,i used it for a walk and it was nice to not have to carry my wallet for the most part,5
7242,i find myself using it around the house to listen to my music without worrying about dropping it,5
7243,this is such a good idea that i'm surprised i haven't seen these in airport newsstands or hospital gift shops,5
7244,it is made by samsung so it is not one of those ugly mega phone cases i hate,5
7245,i've bought so many cases for iphones so far this is the best universal or any mount that i've ever owned,5
7246,your voice may sound a little hollow and the person you are talking to is better than i had hoped,5
7247,the case is well constructed and has worked out very well for me and i'm very satisfied with the product and delivery,5
7248,these came sooner than promised and i wanted to make sure she didn't scratch it all up,5
7249,and there are many apps available on the app store that you can use to check your balance and add minutes,5
7250,a to stay objective i would say that this is comparable to the ampen,5
7251,this is the most powerful usb car charger on the market and i would highly recommend it,5
7252,now finally i will be able to charge 2 devices simultaneously in a car,5
7253,i like that it's matte not glossy and has a nice feel to it not too grippy and not slick again,5
7254,this htc travel charger is the perfect replacement if you are looking for one this will be the best you ever find,5
7255,it is nice and slim so it doesn't add much bulk and such a cheap price,5
7256,overalli couldn't find anything to complain about with this product,5
7257,just tighten it enough to create a snug fit and you won't have to pay for one for your phone,5
7258,i am partially deaf and i have a hard time hearing him if the wind is blowing,5
7259,also since i've installed it i haven't had to look at the manual again,5
7260,we are very happy with this product and would definitely recommend them to others,5
7261,preparing for a recent road trip i was looking for something that i could use with my phone to watch movies listen to music on,5
7262,so you never know if it's going to be a life saver for me since i use my iphone and ipad all the time,5
7263,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new iphone 4 4s case i highly recommend this one,5
7264,i'm able to charge my phone and tablet at the same time which is ok because it charges fast,5
7265,5 note 2 screen was just big enough to be a little difficult to grip sometimes,5
7266,i have dropped it several times and the case has saved it every time,5
7267,i 8217ve been using it since i got it and its been a year nothing has fell off pretty sturdy,5
7268,i have tried several bluetooth headsets over the years and this is one of the smaller ones that i enjoy more,5
7269,my plantronics sticks in the ear just fine and i don't need to take the cover off for battery change,5
7270,i've had a number of bluetooth headsets over the years some good some bad,5
7271,this is the second car phone mount i've owned and i'm extremely satisfied with this case and i highly recommend it,5
7272,i really like my trent it works great the only thing is that the color started coming off within less a month,5
7273,this is the second ifrogz luxe case i have purchased for my lg800 g and this one fits the best,5
7274,it holds a charge for as long as the original battery and the charger works as expected,5
7275,i got one for my husband and really liked it so i was skeptical to switch brands,5
7276,better to have an extra port and not need it than to need it and not have it,5
7277,this case is very snug going in and out of the holster with just the right bit of snugness,5
7278,this fits my iphone 3 g nice and snugly and it was very easy to apply and is sticking without any issues,5
7279,this isn't designed for putting a lot of pressure on it or you will scratch the screen,5
7280,i like this mophie juice pack for my iphone 4s and my 3rd gen ipad and it works great,5
7281,one potential drawback is that it does not have a wall wart at the end of the plug where it would block other outlets,5
7282,i but a lot of cases for my iphones over the years cheap to expensive,5
7283,i got the product fast and it is in perfect condition just how it looks on the website,5
7284,can not say much more about it because it is exactly what we wanted and they function perfectly as we need,5
7285,i received this through the amazon vine program and love it so much that i have purchased more than one for my friends,5
7286,unlike previous versions i can place the phone in my pocket and don't see any scratches or peeling,5
7287,it was cheap and really small so its exactly what i was looking for to carry my new samsung smartphone,5
7288,i have started using these screen protectors on all of our devices and frankly i don't trust anything else,5
7289,i got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it and has told her friends about the otter box,5
7290,it was 30 and doesn't offer as much protection as this case gives it's really not very obtrusive,5
7291,the only concern i have is that the phone has to be on the cradle at all times to get signal,5
7292,it looks so simple clean buuuut make sure you wash your hands and clean the screen good,5
7293,i have been using this case for a little i found a scratch on the skin last weekend,5
7294,only some pet hair under it but other then that it is a nice case and does what it needs to do,5
7295,i would buy another one for myself because its a great case and it really extends the usage of theiphones battery life,5
7296,the texture of the case makes it easier to hold the galaxy sii,5
7297,this product definitely met my expectations and i would definitely recommend it to everyone it is helpful,5
7298,i've never had a problem with these shields and love the fact that they have thick pliable 6 foot cords,5
7299,i had read a lot of reviews for styluses since i do a lot of camping and i need back up batteries,5
7300,i have had problems with the bluetooth disconnecting but i think that may be due to the theme i'm using on the watch face,5
7301,great way to save money and protect my phone as well as the case are still as good as new,5
7302,case is very thin and doesn't bulk up the phone like most other cases do,5
7303,i have used it on both my iphone 5 and ipad mini no case used on either product,5
7304,i drive a loud truck and used to get complaints from the other end about being heard so that's wonderful,5
7305,the sticky pad removed absolutely everything and that is the name of the game as far as your music listening pleasure is concerned,5
7306,other reviews have complained that the color is more green than the pictures shows definitely 34 lime 34,5
7307,the keyring is nice to be able to walk around the house and talk while its charging,5
7308,i really like the blue light that lets you know that the device is charging,5
7309,the case works very well and i don't worry about it getting broken as i carry it in my pocket,5
7310,they work just fine so you don't have to constantly swap out sd cards or batteries,5
7311,i have had mine for about 2 years now and it still works great,5
7312,i've been very happy with this charger and see myself using it all the time to make use of the usb 3,5
7313,protection is just okay looks better than it protects but it does a good job of holding the phone and protecting it without excessive bulk,5
7314,i have several amazon basics products and i've always been pleased with their cellular service and their customer service,5
7315,it's been a year now and i must say they are possibly the best i have ever found,5
7316,so far this has been an excellent buy and i would not hesitate to order another one,5
7317,bottomline i wouldn't hesitate recommending this case to anyone who wants to look cool with a good protection,5
7318,i really didn't have to use it because i had to return the phone so i didn't put it down the garbage disposer,5
7319,i had no problem placing the screen protector on my phone screen fitted my screen perfectly,5
7320,i've been testing this case out for a week and i can say with certainty that it is not that difficult,5
7321,i'm very careful with my electronics but after getting this case i haven't had not one mishap since,5
7322,this case was purchased for a friend and he is very happy with it,5
7323,i do think this charger is a little big but i wish i had one like this for extra protection,5
7324,i received this item for free in exchange for an honest review which you have just read,5
7325,jabra also has two cheaper models so it's not fair to hold laptop connectivity errors against logitech,5
7326,this case is well constructed and also has a nice look to it and is an excellent quality product,5
7327,i bought this phn for my mom and she didn't like it so i gave it to my daughter to use,5
7328,but most importantly the suction cup stays where you put it and you can also store your 3,5
7329,obviously its not as easy with the phone out of the case partially just for that purpose isn't practical,5
7330,alignment was really easy and i was able to get the install right,5
7331,the sound is great the material and shape is great and the price is low so i recommend to all,5
7332,it is the gold phone and this case does not take away any elegance from my phone,5
7333,i like my otterbox better but this is a nice case that keeps your phone from getting scratched up,5
7334,i wasn't sure about this case when i actually received it but now that i have i am very pleased with it,5
7335,i tried it out with pandora and was happy to see the case really did protect it well,5
7336,the moto g has a nice sleek look and is the size of a small flashlight,5
7337,my last case was all silicone and was tough to get out of my pocket and the cutouts for everything are all well positioned,5
7338,it fits good doesn't bubble up with the case on my phone no longer fit my holster,5
7339,it look's nice and it's not bulky at all while still protecting your phone,5
7340,if you're looking for a slim case for your iphone this is the case you want to buy,5
7341,our son has been using these for a few weeks i was impressed,5
7342,overall great device for anyone who is always on the go and not always near a phone charger,5
7343,like most other battery packs of its size this battery pack has two usb ports for charging two devices at once perfect,5
7344,0 ice cream sandwich which is currently at the time of this review makes this an even better value,5
7345,ok hello to all this is the first case i've bought for my phone,5
7346,i ended up selling it to a friend and he liked it a lot,5
7347,it sticks out just far enough from the screen to protect it if it is set face down on a rough surface,5
7348,i have used it every night and i dont have any worries that it will fall out of the holder,5
7349,protects as it should and it doesn't make the phone feel bulky when you hold it,5
7350,i use this for my iphone 5 and i have to change my case,5
7351,doesn't add very much width either and it's thinner than i thought it would be from the picture,5
7352,the fit is great and it is very comfortable to hold in your hand protects ipod even when face down,5
7353,not much to say here other than this case is a perfect fit doesn't add alot of bulk to the phone,5
7354,you see the problem is that if you have two devices that you would like to charge at the same time,5
7355,as far as customer service goes i can honestly say i have never had an earpiece fit better than this,5
7356,keeps my phone protected and the case has a very nice look and feel to it,5
7357,with this retractable cable though we don't need to worry about it falls apart if i drop the phone,5
7358,if you hold your iphone at an angle and look for the dust specks to find them,5
7359,i have a spigen neohybrid case on my white iphone 5 and this thing looks nice on it,5
7360,the hard case is easy to put on but hard to take off,5
7361,the extra battery is as good as the one that came with my phone,5
7362,holds the gps or phone very well and the quality is pretty much indistinguishable from my original,5
7363,if you have something like an otter case you're going to have a phone with a non-removable battery,5
7364,listen to the other reviews this is the best case for the galaxy tab 2 7,5
7365,a subdued vs gaudy gold glitter iphone cover used it a few times and so far no complaints and has worked as expected,5
7366,sharkk bluetooth speaker is one of the gadgets that i have been using every day for about three months without any issues at all,5
7367,just haven't had the need as yet so can't speak to protection that way but so far i am happy with it,5
7368,this case is so beautiful sturdy its exactly what i wanted and even got it in my favorite color great item,5
7369,the phone fits snugly inside and i haven't had any problems with anything coming off,5
7370,i keep my phone in my purse and i don't have to carry a purse,5
7371,it is easily plugged in and i do not need to use my notebook usb port,5
7372,the micro knit fiber tip is smooth to the touch and won 8217 t slip off your fingers,5
7373,the edges of the cover wrap around the phone so that you can add a hanging charm or something,5
7374,this is exactly what i've been looking for a case like this one for my tablet,5
7375,the guide is simple and gives you all the information you need to determine how much juice you have left,5
7376,they are easy to remove if you have to change the battery the case comes off easily enough,5
7377,also very easy to clean and protects does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it well for a very reasonable price,5
7378,i have been able to easily slip it in and out of my pocket but is firm in my hand,5
7379,i've never been a fan of screen protectors in the past and up until recently they were very good,5
7380,these are just as good as the ones that came with the ipads were only 3 ft long,5
7381,overall i gave the unit 5 stars for ease of use simplicity and being a must have,5
7382,i have been using this charger for over a month and i am very pleased with the unit performance package ease of use and functionality,5
7383,these screen protectors are by far the best i've ever had in a case for the iphone,5
7384,unfortunately these are no longer available but they are by far the best pair that i have ever owned in any price range,5
7385,plus the black dots on the turquoise background make it easy to find the page to download new firmware updates,5
7386,i love my new case for my iphone 5 and i only have to charge it once a day and i use it all day,5
7387,showed up in record time and does just what i need it to do and it does it very well,5
7388,some reviews said case was cheap but for the money i paid i recieved an extremely great deal,5
7389,it installed easily after viewing the how-to video on their website is very easy to understand,5
7390,but this is lacking an led light to let you know it's got power so be aware of that,5
7391,even though the sabrent only offers mono sound it isn't a big deal he just puts it in his pocket,5
7392,i thought about switching back to an iphone but didn't want to leave verizon to get one,5
7393,i have had this installed on my windshield for over a month now and the screen protector is still free of scratches,5
7394,easy to pull in and out of your pocket very easily,5
7395,mesh bag that comes with it is nice to keep it from getting scratched when its not in the case,5
7396,these items can save you hundreds and not to mention the time it took for me to get this was good,5
7397,overall i loved these things so much that i got several friends to purchase a set,5
7398,0 iphone ipad old style and of course you can supply your own wire and you supply your own wall charger,5
7399,the charger is compact and the cable is perfect for the iphone 5's lightning cable or a micro-usb cable,5
7400,this case is the most comfortable case i've found for the samsung galaxy note 3 it is perfect,5
7401,you are out of business when you run out of battery and can't find a charger,5
7402,i liked it so much i bought one for my tablet and phone when i am at work,5
7403,so i am very happy to report that i am happy with this phone,5
7404,now i can't even tell there is a case on the phone and it did include directions if you would need them,5
7405,it's not intended to take a lot of abuse in a harsh environment,5
7406,my phone is an htc rezound with an otter case on it which most of us use to protect our investment,5
7407,i've tried several other brands but they don't fit the seidio case got to have the seidio case,5
7408,i've been using this headset for well over a year and the other for a few months,5
7409,i use it in a small airplane and it allows me to plug in my headphones into my phone through the armband,5
7410,the equalizer has a number of pre-sets and gives you the ability to still use it while protecting it,5
7411,caps lock for emphasis not yelling all in all this case is perfect and a lovely color,5
7412,it's really thing so it doesn't add bulk to the phone this is the longest lasting phone battery i have ever owned,5
7413,they come in a nice box and they are really easy to put on and take off but holds well,5
7414,the case has a belt clip which also can be used as a direct-connect speaker using a 3,5
7415,the only minor issue i have with it is that i have to provide my own backup source,5
7416,pros looks greatfeels greatfit is just about perfectvolume and power buttons are easy to press and the fit is exact,5
7417,i purchased this for my daughter and she really liked them,5
7418,the performance is on par if not better than the iphone 4s's i have seen,5
7419,the protective cover is a life saver i drop my phone all the time and since i put this case on yikes,5
7420,this item arrived with some other items i was not happy with the 40 % charge it gave me,5
7421,nice to have a backup for travel so i don't have to worry about it getting scratched up,5
7422,hat the at t logo on the top front of the case and what they are for,5
7423,i really wasn't expecting much from this but i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the package and saw what it contained,5
7424,another thing the fact that this case just has a large opening at the bottom of the caddy for the connection,5
7425,it fit well around the device and does not add any bulk at all to the phone while keeping very classy styling,5
7426,the otter case provides a protective frame on the front of the phone doesn't seem to know the difference,5
7427,gives you privacy people will not be able to see everything from there angle,5
7428,diztronic cases are always perfect fit with just the right amount of base without any tininess at all,5
7429,really good material fits perfectly and the colors are exactly as they are shown,5
7430,i've tried at least a dozen bluetooth headsets and this by far is the best case i have ever owned,5
7431,i bought this case for my thunderbolt and was very happy with the overall quality and protection it gave for her iphone,5
7432,the battery will charge an ipad at the same speed as the apple charger that came with it,5
7433,if you have a lot of devices it's important to be able to charge more than one device and do so quickly as well,5
7434,it is very comfortable and i sometimes forget that i am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable,5
7435,i have ordered this case as well as the quality of the mount,5
7436,made of plastic but i think it will hold up unlike the apple brand,5
7437,it was protected enough not to be damaged when i got it so i had to give it a 5,5
7438,i do love this one because it does what it says it should do and i'm all about that,5
7439,there is no led to let you know it's plugged in and ready to charge,5
7440,overall even if you don't intend to use this as a backup battery for your ipad,5
7441,1 display is covered with slightly curved gorilla glass that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units,5
7442,to that end i am very happy with the quality of it and it wasn't easy to get on,5
7443,does add slight bulk to the phone but for me that actually worked out just perfect,5
7444,impressions i've only had this unit a few days but it appears to be as flawless as any i've seen,5
7445,have been using this for the past year and i'm very happy,5
7446,flexible or you can provide your own cables for both charging the power bank and charging other devices from the power bank,5
7447,one side won't really snap on but that's ok as it doesn't heat the battery at all,5
7448,i have had this item for some time now and have yet to lose any of the jewels,5
7449,the fit is perfect and i have not had a problem thanks i love it,5
7450,when i'm looking for a bluetooth headset there are many that will do,5
7451,love my case my fav color plus it's not hard to put on or take off if need be,5
7452,i really like the diamond pattern on the back and that the finish on the case is great it's soft and smooth,5
7453,for the price you can't ask for much more when it comes to protecting your iphone it's otter all the way,5
7454,i've got to say i'm very impressed so far and would absolutely recommend these to anyone with a note ii,5
7455,this is my second one i got one for my wife's car as she does not have bluetooth,5
7456,and has a protective clear cover built in to protect your screen as well though i would also get a screen protector,5
7457,i would recommend this case to anyone looking for the perfect screen protector,5
7458,but with the build quality it doesn't look like i have a case on my iphone to keep it from breaking and scratching,5
7459,boyfriend loves it it cuz he had to get a new phone i needed a different car charger,5
7460,the description had me wondering if it came with a cable or a somewhat built it cable,5
7461,fits nice and snug and i've yet to have any issues with charging or data transfer,5
7462,there's a more expensive cs540 with hl10 but that's not what you buy this kind of case for,5
7463,it offers protection and it has a nice grip so i don't have to worry about over charging your droid,5
7464,the iflash 3200 mah charger is easily one of the best phone cases i have ever had,5
7465,you will not go wrongbuying this case because it is a hard enough plastic to avoid the issue,5
7466,it took 2 1 2 hours to charge the rest of the way through 100 percent what is a good battery,5
7467,all products from otterbox are worth buying they do a great job of protecting the device and storing about 2-3 credit cards,5
7468,it did take a little while to figure out how to get these on your ears,5
7469,i got it as a gift for my mom and she loves it,5
7470,oh did i mention that this is the best case i've come across so far,5
7471,this charger will charge most any device that can be plugged into a usb slot to power up fyi usb 3,5
7472,i just keep it at my desk or in my bag in case i drain the charged one in my phone,5
7473,the microfiber tip is really nice since it doesn't stick to the inside of his pants pockets,5
7474,i got this for my car it's a bit bulky but definitely worth the cute factor p,5
7475,don't hesitate to buy if you're looking for a 3gs case look no further,5
7476,i'm very happy with this and getting 3 for the price is a great phone do not expect to get a top phone,5
7477,as for the fit of the headset it is very secure on my arm and on the phone,5
7478,i have dropped my phone a few times and my phone is still in tact,5
7479,what i liked about the sir lancelot's screen protector kit is that it comes with two 5v 2a ports,5
7480,overall i would give the nt63 t a 5 out of 5 stars based on my use so far,5
7481,this was intended as a stop gap case because it was cheap and looked like it was well built,5
7482,i have a honda civic and i've been looking for something like this without having to spend double on a smart dock,5
7483,the only problem is the back part of the case is very hard but still spongy enough to absorb shock,5
7484,so bottom line is that i do like the product and have continued to use it,5
7485,with this motorola charger i don't have to bother with the micro usb port on the headset,5
7486,all ports and camera lenses are uncovered and the buttons on the phone work much better than they did with the oem bumper cover,5
7487,i 8217ve been using this battery case for a while now and it is quite an awesome case,5
7488,my only real complaint for this product is the way it fits on my ear just fine so i did not have to purchase any,5
7489,fits perfectly and is not nearly as bulky as i thought it would be for some reason the pics make it look tiny,5
7490,i have had this one for about 6 months and it doesn't have a scratch on it,5
7491,it's perfect for the person who wants to be able to see the great information the various fitness apps can display live,5
7492,many people will already have a couple of these lying around the house if you have any apple products,5
7493,it is so cute and i love the pink and purple combo,5
7494,this fixed it i don't know how many times i've had earphones snatched out of my ears ow,5
7495,its ease-of-use is a good thing because the case does a good job of protecting your iphone,5
7496,this thing is super secure have used it a few months now and i hate the fingerprints on my screen,5
7497,but once you've used the new charging pad you don't want to go to municipal shelter w tons of ppl on cots,5
7498,it doesn't add a ton of bulk to the phone but overall its well designed,5
7499,i've had it for a long time now and these are some of the best tempered glass screen protector i've used so far,5
7500,the fit is spot on and they do exactly what they're designed to do well and this is the case is no different,5
7501,i even like that it perfectly wraps around the front of the phone that acts as a screen guard in a way,5
7502,i own several dash mounts from different vendors and like a lot of people i anxiously awaited the arrival of mophie for iphone 5,5
7503,heavier items can be held as well 8211 i was able to get this at a great price through a kindle deal,5
7504,overall particularly at this price point this is a nice little case and for the price its well worth it,5
7505,i saw it on pretty little liars and i had to have it anyway,5
7506,i have had this case a little over a month now and it's still holding up great,5
7507,that is exactly what my t325 says when i get in my car and it works right every time,5
7508,my 6th or 7th iphone screen replacement for customers this product is high quality and is mounted on the right side of the bud,5
7509,this is the perfect case for what i was looking for in a sturdy thin design,5
7510,it installed easily after viewing the how-to video on their website is very easy to understand,5
7511,i bought this armband for a gift so i can't comment on whether or not that aspect works,5
7512,i purchased these to have extra chargers around the house and work and to give my husband as a gift,5
7513,if you have two iphones this is perfect for charging two tablets at the same time,5
7514,the case has a nice texture to it so it slides in out of your pants pocket nicely,5
7515,my wife has the iphone 5 and i have to say i am very pleased,5
7516,it's built very sturdy and comes with an 18 month warranty and the finish is extremely durable,5
7517,ive been using this for about a week now and i have had no problems with charging or usage,5
7518,just heard the samsung option is now available for more than twice the price so it can't be beat and the charger works fine,5
7519,first its very comfortable and i can walk around all day like this but around the office it works fine,5
7520,this dock includes a adapter that allows you to charge two devices at the same time,5
7521,i still think i prefer the uag case but this is the best design i've ever seen,5
7522,it says it can pair with 2 phones at the same time but haven't tried a tablet yet,5
7523,the screen guard is easy to put on and does exactly what it's supposed to and is what every gadget collector needs,5
7524,for the price this is an excellent case for a very fair price,5
7525,the instruction guide was helpful however i really don't think you can do better than this one and i've tried quite a few,5
7526,this one feels like a much higher quality and i love the fact how fast it got here,5
7527,both let you mount to your windshield or dashboard as long as you have a quality single screen protecter you're good to go,5
7528,her phone is now protected and it feels good in the hand and it is really nice looking,5
7529,at the price this purchase was a no-brainer for me to buy this thing,5
7530,bought for a friend and he is very happy with it and it protects her alcatel phone very well,5
7531,this one works great and is able to charge my phone quickly even while playing pvz2,5
7532,the mount is easy to use as well i just plug it in and when i wake up it's a big difference,5
7533,want good protection without going broke this is the best way to always readily have this phone at your side,5
7534,this item seriously works just as well as the oem apple charging cable,5
7535,will update if i decide to install it gives me peace of mind with all my devices i am a mobile worker,5
7536,any time people say oh you can't tell there's a cover on my phone at all,5
7537,i've been using an over the ear bluetooth but this one sounds great,5
7538,even recognizing these very specific limitations overall i would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a new screen cover for their tmobile cell phone,5
7539,the cable is thick and sturdy and a bit longer than the one that probably came with your phone,5
7540,also since i've installed it i haven't had to look at the manual again,5
7541,i got this case and i had dropped my phone a couple of times and it has definitely protected my phone,5
7542,the screen protector was a perfect fit for my motorola droid razr hd i couldn't be happier,5
7543,when i order this case i didn't have to worry about any slipping,5
7544,they don't add a lot of bulk to the appearance of the phone,5
7545,this product allows me to never have to worry about the screen protector bubbling or coming off,5
7546,one thing to watch out for when you put the battery pack on it all feels like one unit,5
7547,they are really good and worth it i would buy again if it was lost or stolen,5
7548,i use the in the office to listen to music make phone calls and even listen to podcasts,5
7549,but i recommend this if you like the fact that it will charge our iphones ipods and our ipad 2,5
7550,these were cut to just the right size for my phone perhaps a bit too wide,5
7551,i am so glad that i ordered this case for my iphone 4 and didnt want to change,5
7552,the range seems ok by the time i get out of my htc touchpro ii between charges,5
7553,comes with a carrying pouch and charging cable with mini-usb micro-usb in order to use your existing charger,5
7554,26 2010 it's been a year now and i must say they are possibly the best i have ever found,5
7555,one other important thing to note here is that you can use the touchscreen with your fingers through the case,5
7556,love it way easier to apply though make sure you are in a fairly dust free environment without any breeze too,5
7557,the silicone case also slightly covers the edge of the phone screen metal on the left right sides,5
7558,it charges my ipad and iphone and that's what i wanted it to do protect the phone,5
7559,i use this mhl to hdmi adapter for my samsung galaxy s3 and was not really satisfied until i found this one,5
7560,it's not bad though allowing free access to all the ports and controls while providing scuff protection,5
7561,it will charge my ipad and phone at the same time but don't have enough outlets,5
7562,they weren't particularly bad but i'll be sticking with this brand for my all my future screen protector needs,5
7563,therefore this devices gets 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what it says it does and did a great job,5
7564,i've owned many phone cases and this case is one of several but she likes it,5
7565,i like the fabric on it and the case is still in tact after 1 months use,5
7566,this rubber purple iphone 4 case fits great on my phone and protects it at the same time,5
7567,thinking about purchasing another one for my phone as it is a power workhorse,5
7568,my wife really liked some of the cases i was in the process of getting an htc vivid so i went for it,5
7569,it fit my iphone 4 very well and i would recommend this to anyone if you love royal blue and glam,5
7570,this is an inexpensive plastic case if you don't want to accidentally drop and destroy your 900 surface pro,5
7571,it protects the screen when you lay it down on its face without scratching the screen,5
7572,the minute i don't have a case on your phone,5
7573,the only problem i've found is that it works with my 4th gen ipod,5
7574,i have tried several screen protectors and these are as good if not better then competitor qi base charging stations,5
7575,all in all this is a great package and i would highly recommend it if you need serious protection for your mobile device,5
7576,this is a little bulky but i dont mind because i dont use it,5
7577,more than satisfied with this purchase and will be buying more for stocking stuffers,5
7578,sometimes i forget i even have a screen protector on because it fully covers the screen,5
7579,with two ports i can charge my ipad and my iphone and tether the two together,5
7580,now the best feature if you dont need to use the screen protector because i already have a glass one installed on my phone,5
7581,at 5600 mah it can charge my iphone 4s approximately 4 times before i need to recharge the anker itself,5
7582,definitely i'd recommend this to anyone with the samsung galaxy mega 6,5
7583,the case also protrudes slightly beyond the face of the phone so that it is not unleveled,5
7584,it feels like there isn't even a screen protector there,5
7585,the screen protector was very easy to put on no bubbles no nothing,5
7586,i got it as per the description and i'm happy with the amount of customization you can do,5
7587,overall i would say that with this case you get the m8 in all its glory,5
7588,if you don't then you definitely don't want to have finger prints and dust under the glass,5
7589,basic no frills case that does the job of protecting the back and front from minor scratches,5
7590,my phone stays in place and is easy to slide the phone into the soft sleeve and that into the hard case,5
7591,i 8217 d like to start off by saying that i am terrible at putting screen protectors on,5
7592,it's not as bulky as most of the other batteries that i've used or come across,5
7593,my order was shipped and received on time and i had no problems reaching that no not in one sitting sheesh,5
7594,personally i use it to charge my phone while i'm out there in the river,5
7595,it is still very slim and the cover means i don't need to carry an extra wallet with me,5
7596,bottom line this is the best slim case out there for the samsung galaxy note 3 it still does the job,5
7597,i already had the h700 and really liked it so i was skeptical to switch brands,5
7598,with this device i can charge my phone and a spare battery at the same time so i cant talk to that,5
7599,all in all this is a great portable charger for the money and i would definitely recommend this to dx owners,5
7600,they do not scratch your screen and they are compact and fit in my gym bag side pocket quite comfortably,5
7601,a single charge provides 7-8 hours of play time just isn't enough,5
7602,with 2 ipad 8217s and 2 iphones as well as a few other items and they have not let me down yet,5
7603,imho this has to be one of the best bluetooth headsets in market and performs as advertised,5
7604,all in all i like this case and it is the best protection bar none,5
7605,just received my case today and i put it on my galaxy note 2 and bluetooth headset at the same time,5
7606,holding mechanismthis is what i really like about this case is that it is apple tested and approved,5
7607,i would rate this a 5 out of 5 stars for function and utility,5
7608,it's a perfect fit and is very easy to put on and very good in quality too,5
7609,i used it to charge my iphone and ipad by using this cable when connected to a pc mac also syncs the iphone with itunes,5
7610,it was the perfect size for her and i'm happy that the cord isn't too short,5
7611,this wall charger does exactly what it's supposed to be,5
7612,i fear buying electronics online and i took a chance on this case even though there were negative reviews,5
7613,i have a motorola hs850 earpiece and wanted to make sure that i was satisfied with my purchase,5
7614,of course it takes about 20 hours to charge it back up using a standard wall charger,5
7615,i bought the titan 2 over the titan 1 due to the fact that it is a little slimmer than the silicone case,5
7616,i find those to be more than sufficient for my work vehicle too,5
7617,i own two different types of emergancy portable chargers and this is one of the best quickest car chargers i've ever owned,5
7618,i've owned this case for a couple of weeks now and not experienced any issues,5
7619,if you have repaired a iphone before you know it's a pain to take so many cables,5
7620,this otterbox is the real deal and a great way to protect an expensive piece of technology,5
7621,i have bought this case in the past for my iphone 5 and it fits perfectly,5
7622,they kinda scratch easy but i don't mind i knew this would happen,5
7623,i got the droid 3 when it first came out and loved it so i decided to get this one,5
7624,it then picked up the right audio and the sound quality is great without drowning out everything like an ear plug,5
7625,it is sturdy but thin so it fits in my pocket better than a bulky otter box,5
7626,all you have to do is make sure you have the right cables and you should be set,5
7627,i leave mine in the car so it's not a problem to take the case off if need be,5
7628,this product works as it says with my ipad air and my iphone before it needs to be charged itself,5
7629,i then tested it with an iphone 4s and an iphone 5 at the same time and this was it,5
7630,i've had numerous cell phone holsters over the years and this is the only phone that let me want to upgrade,5
7631,since i needed an extra long usb cable for my iphone really is nice,5
7632,this is great very well priced also and it is always nice to spend less time charging my phone,5
7633,can't say too much yet since i don't use a case and more importantly i never drop these guys,5
7634,one important note is that it has a hole for the apple design making it visible,5
7635,there's a blue ring around the charger that lets you know it's in bluetooth mode shutting down etc,5
7636,navigation considering the fact that it uses google maps i have no doubt that the charger could have handled a fourth device,5
7637,far outlasting the battery that came with the phone which makes them more portable,5
7638,it is important to me that i do not run out of power with my electronic devices,5
7639,it's a replacement for otterbox if you don't want a thundergrip base just leave the plastic sheet on it,5
7640,they last about 6 months and it's still like new,5
7641,full disclosure i got a sample of this product for testing and my honest review,5
7642,the back does show fingerprints a bit but it has a nice feel to it especially with the new rubberized case,5
7643,i love this thing and the battery life is very nice without frequent charging,5
7644,unlike those other rubber tipped styli i bought a long time ago and i still have it without any marks,5
7645,i bought this as a gift for my wife's htc one and my gs3 into the 2 ports,5
7646,it charges my phone great and has a nice feel to it and fits the 4s phone well,5
7647,i rushed over made the trade and i wake up the next day and bam my phone has a full battery,5
7648,so many of these tpu cases make cutouts for the power button and the volume rocker work great through the case,5
7649,installation was easy the price was right and i have been using it in my truck for an iphone 5s and it works perfectly,5
7650,what i like about bluetooth gifting is that if you are like me you have been thru alot of car chargers,5
7651,with this glass screen however there were no bubbles at all and super easy to install,5
7652,mpero collection 5 pack of clear screen protectors for samsung galaxy s3 i really recommend this product,5
7653,this does not add too much more weight to the phone and the rubber is not cheap its a sturdy good material,5
7654,i have been using the case for a few weeks now and it's works great,5
7655,we had already bought an otterbox case at the at t store and it was applied by the rep there,5
7656,between the 2 i have purchased 3 different cases for the iphone 3gs and this by far is the best one,5
7657,we have been on vm for a couple of years now and it has never failed me with continuous use,5
7658,those 3 foot lightning cables just are not long enough to allow me to leave the charger in my pocket and go,5
7659,i have been using this for a couple of months and then i upgraded to the 5,5
7660,the magnet in the mount is strong enough to hold on to the phone not slippery at all,5
7661,some minor complaints i have about this case is that it's not only protective but it's stylish,5
7662,i like it because it adds a bit of weight to the phone but that's a good thing,5
7663,it has a raised edge along the front to protect the screen some but i would also recommend a screen protector,5
7664,i recommend this to my friends and i will be buying another for my other car,5
7665,the skiva is one of the best i have ever bought,5
7666,the new trent imp90c is a really good choice for my cars bought 2,5
7667,one thing i like is it doesn't smudge as much as other brands i've tried,5
7668,the button access is great connection opening are good and you have easy access to all the side buttons no problem,5
7669,it definitely helps with the antenna issue so i am more than satisfied with this device and would recommend this to friends and family,5
7670,there are three notches in the interior to allow you to use the phone as one of the smartest remotes you will ever use,5
7671,it has a small adhesive area to keep it in place and it doesn't move a single bit,5
7672,no onboard mic on this product so i'll have to use the case a little longer before i know for certain,5
7673,1 tablet at the same time i give this item a 5 star rating cos it exceeds my expectation,5
7674,even if you are happy with your 4's it's not enough of an issue to hurt my rating,5
7675,to begin charging your device you'll need to hit the power button to wake up the phone,5
7676,ive had it on for a few days so we will see how they hold up,5
7677,things that i don't like about it is you can't use it with a case that has a flip cover,5
7678,at this price you can afford to give them away to friends who stop by and like they're that cheap,5
7679,-have a bright light over the phone so you can still use the ir blaster and and it covers all the buttons,5
7680,once slapped on it looks like a solid piece of equipment and fits better in my hand,5
7681,i've been using this for over a month now and still love it,5
7682,i use this case when i go out and don't want to worry about batteries going dead,5
7683,so other than minor quibbles i have to say that i am in love with both of them though,5
7684,this item was cheap enough to try out and i wish i had bought this as soon as i purchased my phone,5
7685,this one is so much better than the otterbox case and no where near the thickness,5
7686,when you pay big bucks for a phone you should be able to do this yourself if you're careful,5
7687,i had absolutely no problems and though i can be a bit of a worry that it won't last out,5
7688,it's a true oem battery and it works great with my iphone 4 and my ipad simultaneously without issue,5
7689,yes it a little bulky but i've gotten used to it over time but it's plantronics fault i had to buy it anyway,5
7690,i just received my case today and i put it on my galaxy note 2 and bluetooth headset at the same time,5
7691,it protects the phone very well and i use it everyday on two devices,5
7692,one of the things i like about this case is it does show scratches on the case not the phone,5
7693,in the interests of full disclosure i was provided this product free of charge for review,5
7694,it has a nice weight is a good fit in my hand and it is a very snug fit and muffle external sound,5
7695,from reading the reviews i took a chance on this and it was perfect,5
7696,01 price tag added it to my att account but now that i have it i am glad and its well spent money,5
7697,this is hands down the best protector i have ever owned and it has been such a breeze,5
7698,it does not come with an ac plug you will have to use the included headphone extension to use regular headphones,5
7699,the controls are intuitive and easy to use and you can charge two items at the same time,5
7700,the lip of the case slightly protrudes the front of the phone so it gives it some protection too,5
7701,my similar case from marware had finally worn out after a year and a half of heavy usage the left ear speaker stopped working,5
7702,this works much better for him and the sound quality is great without drowning out everything like an ear plug,5
7703,it is clear so i can still see the beauty of the htc one m7,5
7704,as far as the amp power on this charger there is no problem with this case and being able to take pictures,5
7705,i bought this in oct 2012 have been using this for over 6 months and it still works great,5
7706,this battery is as good as the one that came with your device this will do,5
7707,i also like that the case doesn't get stuck in my pocket while still not being slippery in hand,5
7708,i like this case very much i know it will protect my phone from a lot of damage,5
7709,i left mine to dry overnight and have had no issues with the durability of the film,5
7710,the only big complaint i have with this phone is that it does not have a plastic screen protector built in,5
7711,it fits the phone perfectly and does the job of protecting your phone and the graphics are nice to look at,5
7712,this was by far one of the easiest screen protectors i've ever installed,5
7713,this battery works just as good as the one that comes with the qcell battery,5
7714,i have already tested the impact resistance and i am happy to say that i am very impressed with this product,5
7715,overall this take anywhere keychain usb adapter is a must have for those who want to be able to charge 2 devices at a time,5
7716,although i did this right before i slept so i woke up the next morning it showed the expected 3 solid bars,5
7717,does exactly what it's supposed to do so i got what i paid for obviously take my 5 star rating within reason,5
7718,i have found my battery life to be better on the s4 compared to the note 3 and this mount works just as well,5
7719,my old battery wasn't holding a charge and i wasn't sure if that would affect it's ability to hold the phone,5
7720,why i like them i love that i can simply place my phone in the case and plug in the audio cord,5
7721,i thought it would look cheap since the price is so low but it far exceeded my expectations,5
7722,the yubi is one of those devices that you need if you do not like the ear-plug types that go in your ear,5
7723,don't use it much though because you have to take off your case for anyfunctionscons nonebuy this full body case with confidence,5
7724,when i put it on my phone to make sure i didn't bend or break anything,5
7725,flexible yet it looks and feels like one of those hard shell cases but in a good way,5
7726,i'd highly recommend this case to anyone who is looking for any kind of protection for their phone,5
7727,still it is small lightweight and portable and does a great job of protecting the phone while not turning it into a monstosity,5
7728,it doesn't in my opinion i tried the otterbox commuter and replaced it with the q card case,5
7729,as other reviewers have said it is difficult to put on a good sign,5
7730,my only complaint is about the size of the galaxy s3 which is very important to me and it's durable,5
7731,the case is thin so it doesn't add any bulk to the gs iii,5
7732,these screen protectors are a perfect fit and easy to get on and off,5
7733,i had to buy an external battery pack just so i can make it through the day without needing to recharge my phone,5
7734,we love that it tells you how much talk time you have left every time you turn on your bluetooth,5
7735,eventually i caved and purchased it new from a brick and mortar store for three times as much,5
7736,so i pushed the otter plastic screen protector out of the case it is a secure protected place for carrying your smart phone,5
7737,what's also nice is the addition of a usb port so you can use your own cable specific to your device,5
7738,compared to the myriad of other cases i owned in the past for various phones and smartphones have been made of silicone,5
7739,the reason i purchased the screen covers is because of the low price and gave some away and kept some as spare cases,5
7740,she had dropped her old texting phone countless times and i was worried that the case would inhibit my phone use,5
7741,thus don't spend much on this item if you don't want to use bluetooth and just need the speaker part,5
7742,my mother loves it and i recommend it to anyone looking for a dual usb charger that outputs 2,5
7743,i'm very happy with this unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for just a great stylus,5
7744,it holds the phone securely and is easy to adjust to any angle and very secure on the dashboard,5
7745,i did not want one with a built in screen protector that even covered the home button,5
7746,this is a good case for the price and so easy to take on and off but overall worth the price,5
7747,the best thing about this version is i don't need to worry about scratching the glass since i always wear long nails,5
7748,if you are considering a case for your iphone and don't want to spoil the look with a black cord,5
7749,easy to put on easy to get the phone out and all ports line up perfectly,5
7750,bought this by mistake but i love the color and design of this case,5
7751,its small but the volume is great and it seems to self heal with small scratches,5
7752,received on time and exactly as described and works perfectly with my digital camera,5
7753,i bought this case for a friend as a gift and she loves it,5
7754,since the phone is waterproof it is super easy to install and is like a brand new battery,5
7755,ismooth has not disappointed yet again could not be happier with the quality and usability of the galaxy gear,5
7756,the bass packs a strong punch and plentiful but not to the point where it could be too loose on the phone,5
7757,overall this phone is absolutely brilliant and i'm really glad i received this piece to give it an honest review,5
7758,i did the steam method in the bathroom with the shower running to cut down on floating lint particles,5
7759,1 amps so it's more than adequate for a dorm room or a teenager's use,5
7760,i have now purchased 4 of these as they do a great job of protecting the phone and is simple to remove and replace,5
7761,so i am sure it will do what it is suppose to do charge my phone while driving,5
7762,now i can look forward to using my phone without having to worry about having it unplug itself when i roll over,5
7763,the case is comfortable in the hand doesn't add too much bulk to my phone yet provided some sort of protection,5
7764,no scratch because they have a plastic cover at the back of the case while it's on your hone,5
7765,i wish it had an option for charging in the car but no charging adapter for 110vac power,5
7766,item was brand new and is exactly what i expected from my tpu cover,5
7767,you would never know it as this case really does protect the phone and its really cute would recommend to anyone,5
7768,the 800mah internal battery could be recharged from a usb port with a water-resistant cover,5
7769,i have used this case for about 2 years and it still works great,5
7770,and it this unit lets in most ambient sound so you don't feel like they're going to fall off,5
7771,the screen is so smooth and a lot better than the previous cheap headset she had,5
7772,the package comes with three but i have had the same button on for a couple months,5
7773,the soft gel also makes the phone easy to slip in and out of tight jeans instead of the ample space of a jacket pocket,5
7774,that's really nice for travel since you don't want to get ripped off by stock cables,5
7775,great item as it was delivered on time and is a great purchase,5
7776,i would recommend doing it in the evening so you can leave your phone on to see if any messages are coming through,5
7777,i did have an armorsuit screen protector but it didn't seem like it could or would do anything wonderfully,5
7778,i'm not often low on battery life with my phone but when i saw it for 60 i jumped right on it,5
7779,the cable is decently long and allows me to plug it into any usb port for charging,5
7780,i do feel obligated to say if you're looking for something to protect your phone,5
7781,although i initially had some doubts after using the product for a few days i am quite impressed with it,5
7782,now my son can listen to his bumpin tunes and i can listen to my music and podcasts through the bluetooth,5
7783,the case is perfect flexible and has a nice look and feel to it,5
7784,overall what i like about it is that it doesn't have a built in screen protector,5
7785,this is an exact replacement of the battery i have in the phone but it installed with no problems,5
7786,the slicker feeling cases slide in and out of my pocket this eliminated most rubberized and silicone cases,5
7787,i'm more likely to use my phone as a gps,5
7788,i notice no speed difference between this and the cable that came with it and with one i already had,5
7789,i got this simply because it was a good price for it for him,5
7790,when i go on walks am able to place my phone in and out of my purse or pocket easily,5
7791,doesn't seem to be when it's taken out of the package but it fits great on the phone and looks great,5
7792,while charging the powerpak i was able to charge a samsung galaxy 7 in tablet,5
7793,this case is very basic and works very well with my phone even with the case on,5
7794,since the case comes with a protective film for the screen as well as a holder for credit cards driver's license or whatever,5
7795,i just wish it would go around the sides of my phone but so far it hasn't,5
7796,i bought this battery as a replacement and it works just as good as the one i got with my phone and it works flawlessly,5
7797,the phone has been dropped a couple of times already and the cases surely did the job,5
7798,came very fast and now i don't have to worry about my voltage only about converter,5
7799,the cords are thick and the lightning end is a little large but it is a small pic up on the bottom,5
7800,it charges my galaxy note very fast and the charge lasts for a long time and sound quality is amazingly good,5
7801,i have been using one of the cables since the day i received it and they both ordered one from amazon,5
7802,i'm very happy with this and getting 3 for the price is a great phone do not expect to get a top phone,5
7803,the dual usb ports is very useful and it is one of the greatest gifts i have received,5
7804,i've reviewed quite a few bluetooth headsets over the past few years you really do get what you pay for and these are fabulous,5
7805,not a big deal but it does seem like it will protect the phone,5
7806,that and a couple cords you and your friends never have to worry about a low battery plus it protects the headset,5
7807,i jump in the car and toss my phone on the floor every day as a demonstration,5
7808,like most car mounts this one offers 360 degree rotation so you can rock at the angle of your choice,5
7809,i have tried many different screen protectors and have been very happy with all purchases,5
7810,i replaced it with this one you can never have too many ports for usb chargers in the car,5
7811,has enough juice to charge my phone fully about 4-5 times and the ipad almost twice,5
7812,it also doesn't stick to things either and easily slides in and out of your pocket if you use it that way,5
7813,so i bought two charging pads one for the office one for my car and one for my house,5
7814,i bought two and carry them when i have to be out all day and don't want to risk dead-battery,5
7815,i immediately purchased this spare battery charger and battery and it has come in handy several times and does an amazing job,5
7816,i would recommend this style of case to everyone it provides a lot of protection for the ipad and is comfortable and easy to use,5
7817,the device is clear and loud the buttons are easy to find they stick out enough and work really well,5
7818,once you've got it start peeling off the rest of the backing applying the screen as you go,5
7819,i managed to install the screen protector on the phone without any problems,5
7820,with a 2 year warranty i also don't have to look at the screen to see if it came on or went off,5
7821,it's a little on the short side and doesn 8217 t come with a charge but uses the now standard usb connections,5
7822,bought this for my phone in my car all the time as an ipod,5
7823,and the best part is if you mess up the alignment all you have to do is pull it out from the side,5
7824,my only slight complaint is that it's a little hard to read black on black,5
7825,the unit arrived with about a 3 4ths charge i plugged in my phone and it quickly built up the charge on the phone,5
7826,it's got nice big buttons it's easy to use and comfortable to wear for long periods,5
7827,i love these cases because they're easy to take on and off so swapping batteries is a piece of cake,5
7828,fits the 4s perfectly and it is easy enough to shake the water out,5
7829,this is the third case i have bought for this phone and the one i'm sticking with,5
7830,overall for the price i'm very pleased with it and highly recommend it,5
7831,i also have a tempered glass screen protector on my note 2 and it works great,5
7832,there is no problem operating the volume and power buttons and space for the headset and usb jacks,5
7833,nice screen savers for my phone recomend they are very easy to apply to a clean dry phone,5
7834,i love this thing and use it all the time with my iphone when at home,5
7835,the tabs snap on and don't get in the way and doesn't look like a growth sprouting from your ear,5
7836,it does take a bit to get here but it's a great price and thats why i love it,5
7837,i wanted a case that would fit snugly but not so much that you have trouble dislodging from the magnet,5
7838,it has also been able to charge my first generation ipad 100 %,5
7839,the older version has been solid for me and i've enjoyed using it except for the very very basic screen,5
7840,the powerbank does a good job of charging my phone with no problem and the nice colors are a plus,5
7841,the unit works but it does not seem to be listed on amazon,5
7842,unlike those other rubber tipped styli i bought a long time ago but they did fit perfectly and held up well,5
7843,the urban armor gear case for a week now and i have had no problems with it,5
7844,i lile this the best out of all the cases ive bought this one is my favorite,5
7845,i will note it's a little large but it puts out enough power to get the job done as quickly as possible,5
7846,this case is a little heavier and adds some weight to the phone but is not heavy and is well worth the extra bulk,5
7847,the color is perfect and it fits my phone perfectly and i love the purple color,5
7848,i park my car outside all the time and i have not heard any complain so far,5
7849,the rubbery feel gives it great grip so that it doesn't feel like a hard case,5
7850,it's not like it would be without it but it's not a bright orange as is represented in the product photos,5
7851,and in fairness the pen side worked well also but i found it to be a very pleasant and efficient process,5
7852,on my end voice quality is exactly the same as my factory apple cord,5
7853,i purchased my galaxy s4 when they first came out and were made made by duracell and energizer,5
7854,the front screen is thin enough to where it doesn't get in the way of my keyboard,5
7855,no leaks that seems to be one of the fastest car charges available,5
7856,5 mm speaker cable to hook it up to my computer or a wall outlet,5
7857,its enough protection without hiding the shape of the phone and maintains the same slim feel,5
7858,so when it came time to get a new one for my iphone 5,5
7859,it's great for me to keep in my purse so that i always have a spare,5
7860,i will stick with this type of case because it doesn't add too much bulk like the other otter box cases,5
7861,not heavy stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove for the price you can't go wrong,5
7862,i even wear them when i go grocery shopping so i don't have to use two hands to put it on my ear correctly,5
7863,probably not the best if you are in a hurry find another cover,5
7864,it's a heavier duty cover and the colors are vibrant and it's so easy to position for gps driving and handsfree talking,5
7865,i too read what others put in there reviews and that is why i ordered these ear hooks that are supposed to be unbreakable,5
7866,the intelligent volume control works great when you are in a loud room with lots of extraneous noise,5
7867,i love this product its nice and easy to put on your phone looks great and fits exactly what i needed,5
7868,i'm glad to not have to carry my wallet around all the time,5
7869,actions speak louder than words i'm going to be buying it in more colors pretty soon,5
7870,i have handsfree bluetooth link in my car and it has come in handy a number of times,5
7871,i really like my trent it works great the only thing is that the tail falls off butt it's still usable,5
7872,9830 has a built-in flashlight which is a handy feature if you ever need to travel and take it with you,5
7873,i dropped my phone a few times and i am so glad i got her a screen cover helps alot,5
7874,the only issue i'm now noticing is that there is a small slit below the volume rocker and power button is covered,5
7875,you can also see the stipple pattern on the back of the case i love that it has a stand on the back,5
7876,some great features such as raised case design if you drop your phone on the ground i'm sure it would be much better,5
7877,before proceeding i want to disclose that i received a review sample and immediately charged this up with the provided charging cable,5
7878,it's very durable and has done a great job protecting it from drops and falls onto cement,5
7879,now on to things that i really like about this case is the ability to change out the colors of the back,5
7880,we got the black iphone and although the back of the case is very thick rubber at least 1 8 thick,5
7881,it's tough to tell there is even a screen protector on my phone and i'm glad i did,5
7882,snaps on perfectly is light weight and doesn't add more weight to phone,5
7883,i love the quality of this case it doesn't get much better than this,5
7884,i have not installed these yet so i don't want to carry around your phone charger everywhere you go,5
7885,protects your phone and you are still able to use your phone while the device is charging it,5
7886,this fits perfectly for my sg3 and it's really easy to put on and take off as needed,5
7887,it was at my door way faster then i thought it would be i drop my phone a lot and this has protected it,5
7888,update i have been using this case for about a week now and so far the screen is holding up well,5
7889,it makes my phone have at least 5 hours of on-screen time if not using it as much,5
7890,this otter box is by far one of the better ones that i've used,5
7891,i even had it on all the way and had to take it off because the corners were starting to peel off,5
7892,my wife and i would highly recommend it for anyone with an i phone,5
7893,out of all the cases i have and it seems to be the best battery pack that i've owned to date,5
7894,after two years i am still looking for a phone that will remain relevant for a while,5
7895,finally a wall charger that can handle charging two devices at once is a big plus,5
7896,i know atleast for me that i am always on the go and always needing a backup power source for electronics,5
7897,i recently purchased my retina mini and didn't think twice about it b c it's that good,5
7898,my idea was to use this case occasionally when i didn't want to keepup with an extra power supply or charger,5
7899,the included screen protector is easy to install and the sound quality is perfect,5
7900,also it's easily removed and doesn't take up a lot of the side of the screen,5
7901,the grey one was so slick i had a hard time getting the phone plugged in and charging the entire time,5
7902,i would also argue it's one of the best portable speakers i've had the pleasure to review,5
7903,this slick little charger plugs into your car port and the other side has the 5 usb ports,5
7904,not only is it cool but it makes it easy to locate in the dark and doesn't obstruct use in any way,5
7905,it fits the iphone 5 like a glove and has a nice feel to it especially with the new rubberized case,5
7906,i have gotten numerous compliments on the case and i could not find a better deal anywhere online,5
7907,5 hrs and my iphone 4s from 50 % to 100 % in one hour and six minutes,5
7908,i haven't had any problems with it but then again i haven't spent very much time on it,5
7909,the charger works with other usb devices and i was able to charge two tablets overnight without any issues,5
7910,it is super easy to use simply plug it in to charge it or have something charging from it,5
7911,you can also use the included micro-usb cord to charge it when you need to re-charge the unit,5
7912,at a whopping 3 000 mah it does take a while to ship but that this price it's worth it,5
7913,i like the silicone better than plastic i am very pleased with this product and so am i,5
7914,i read tons of reviews and watched the video on how to position it and it went in as advertised,5
7915,it also has the loops for even more securement but i don't see the kind of delays that some have written about,5
7916,i recommend tying a string through this so that it doesn't get all scratched up like those harder plastic protectors,5
7917,fit nice on the phone and seems to be plenty of protection without all the bulk associated with other otter-box type cases,5
7918,fits great looks good and doesn't make the phone that much larger either,5
7919,the sound and power buttons are easy to push unlike other cases i have used the rubber edges have not even slightly come off,5
7920,having two usb ports is a plus when you have more than one device to charge overnight either mine or someone else's,5
7921,my only issues with the case is that it doesn't add too much additional size,5
7922,skinomi has stayed in place since i put it on and it was crooked of course,5
7923,no matter how hard i press it down it doesn't seem to stick out so far that it interferes with use,5
7924,even though the sabrent only offers mono sound it isn't a big deal to pop the case off to use them,5
7925,i received the imp120d two days ago and i must say that this is by far the best car charger that i've ever used,5
7926,at 4 x 4 inches the unit is a bit larger than i anticipated i still love the thickness,5
7927,i did alot of research before i bought this and it does the job protect just that my cell phone,5
7928,i liked it very much now they need to make one that works with my kindle fire hd,5
7929,the phone itself is rather plain looking feels great in the hand and i love the gunmetal color and feel,5
7930,it works perfectly and does exactly what it says it does and is well build and easy to use,5
7931,i have 2 extended batteries for my htc evo 4 g and when i saw this i had to have it,5
7932,update 18 march 2014after having the case for a week i am very pleased with it,5
7933,i have been using this phone holder for about 4 months now and it works just as it is suppose to,5
7934,love that there are kickstands on both the hard part of the case covers the sides of the phone not the back,5
7935,i love this case i have it on right now and never had any problems with charging anything with a micro usb,5
7936,this is a very affordable screen protector and easy to put on your phone and the colors are very vibrant also,5
7937,battery life i've been using these headphones for a few months now and it works perfect,5
7938,i just got her a new phone and i wasn't going to use it a lot 8230 so i tried it,5
7939,now my nexus feels more solid in the hand and i can not complain so far,5
7940,this 4 foot usb3 cable is pretty much the same as the case i had for my old phone optimus v was less than desirable,5
7941,bottom line this is the best screen protector for the iphone,5
7942,and there is a decent lip all the way around the front of the case that helps protect the screen from falls,5
7943,i was having charging problems with my iphone 5 and it was really clear and very durable,5
7944,my teenager had a button on his iphone 5 and i couldn't be more happier with now cute it is,5
7945,do take into account however that i'm not a heavy user of my cell phone or touch while paddling,5
7946,phone hasn't fallen yet so i can't tell you how this performs in that case,5
7947,there is a clear window in the back of the case so it doesn't get lost,5
7948,i purchased this screen protector because i wanted to protect my phone screen and this does a perfect job,5
7949,the higher powered one can be used to charge a variety of different models,5
7950,these ankers last all day and i am a heavy user of the phone during the day,5
7951,if you want everything white this is the perfect case for my wife's s4 samsung galaxy note,5
7952,down side is while outside taking pictures you can't see the screen if you're standing behind or beside me,5
7953,it doesn't add too much bulk to the phone but just enough to make it more comfortable in hand,5
7954,i bought this product because the charger that came with my tomtom broke in half one day,5
7955,if you're looking for a nice purple case for your iphone 5 this should be a very good choice,5
7956,i don't have a smartphone with bluetooth but i have no doubt that it will hold the phone up vertically,5
7957,hey at least i didn't have to wait a month to get it,5
7958,the semi-rigid case slips on the phone without too much effort while managing to not come off as flimsy,5
7959,so even though i enjoy my mac all i can say is that she is a happy camper,5
7960,you almost cant tell that there is even a case on the phone but due to design it seems quite protective,5
7961,the packaging the service and the quality of this product is excellent easy to assemble,5
7962,as a matter of fact i would highly recommend it to anyone who is a marvel captain america or avengers fan,5
7963,now all manufacturers have to do is figure out a way to use one for something else and make it work,5
7964,this cell phone holder was well worth the money and i am so happy i did,5
7965,i have dropped my iphone a few times and it has lasted very well and protected my phone,5
7966,the color makes it much easier to find in my purse,5
7967,really pleased with this product and the company that sells it delivered quickly,5
7968,you'll need itunes on your desktop to get the most out of their hyundai factory stereo without factory bluetooth,5
7969,it's a very pretty lavender purple i'm very pleased with the order coming with 6 screen protectors,5
7970,great job everything good but i had to return it because my husband wanted a different color,5
7971,but most importantly the suction cup stays where you put it and you can also store your 3,5
7972,you'll still need to order a screen protector if you're really not sure how to do it,5
7973,it's well made and even though i've dropped it several times and the phone is not broken,5
7974,this product is great and worked well during my trip out of town when i lost my high power dual port usb car charger,5
7975,easy to use and stores out of the way when not in use which is the reason i got it,5
7976,there 8217s the usual led 8220 gas gauge 8221 to show how much power is left in the battery,5
7977,i have purchased 2 otterbox defenders a black one for me and a purple one for my wife's phone,5
7978,i also plugged in my ipad and charged it from 70 % to 100 % ends with 3 led lights on3,5
7979,while the image isn't as crystal clear as it is without the protector but this is to be expected,5
7980,when i got my nexus 4 last week there was no question as to whether i would buy this genuine samsung product,5
7981,i'm using it to charge a variety of devices save for iphone ipod,5
7982,the controls are on the front of the unit and the other is basically the same as the old torch,5
7983,took this on a trip and didn't need to charge it before i used it the first time,5
7984,best car charger ever and cute love the way it lights up when it has a connection in the plug outlet,5
7985,i'm using this to charge both my nexus 7 2013 and galaxy s5 with qi wireless charging back,5
7986,i got the matte pink design and it fits my samsung galaxy phone plus a few credit cards and money well,5
7987,however it adds just enough grip to the phone that it's not constantly slipping from his grasp like his black plastic case does,5
7988,i took it out of the box i was able to charge my phone for the entire week long camping trip,5
7989,charges up fast and small enough to fit in the side pocket of my man-bag,5
7990,covers only screen not entire glass-i guess that is why it is called that and makes a huge fashion statement,5
7991,in closing i would like to recommend this product to anyone that has an ipad or tablet,5
7992,droid turn-by-turn navigation gps i had a chance to use this product as yet,5
7993,because i am more likely to use it to listen to music when i walk but i really don't like full rubberized tacky cases,5
7994,the raised fairy wings provide a non-slip grip on your phone ipod and also reduces vibration and noise,5
7995,this replacement battery is the same as the one that they sell in the store for 30,5
7996,helps keep my phone where i can see it and use it,5
7997,sound quality is great and it is so easy to use and it looks nice too,5
7998,i also was forced to keep popping my phone out of its case and put it in the bottom of the case for the microphone,5
7999,fits perfect in your hands and doesn't feel like it adds any extra weight,5
8000,i absolutelly love this docking station i love the fact that you are given a choice of backing colors,5
8001,the case is very nice it fits perfectly on the phone and it makes it easier to find the home button and looks cute,5
8002,but if that's not an issue you want to keep the look and feel of the case,5
8003,i have gone through several 4 actually rechargeable cases and this is the best i have seen in the market,5
8004,if you have an iphone you know how easy it is to miss charging it back up overnight,5
8005,great material would recommend this to anyone with the nexus 4,5
8006,but not my s3 sold it to a co-worker and i have plenty left over,5
8007,hi yeah my wife and i love the fact that the cords are already built into the product,5
8008,excellent fit unlike many other cases there is plenty of room for an average cell phone like my lg viper,5
8009,these screen protectors are great if you're looking for a replacement or just an extra battery,5
8010,very nice phone case i dropped my phone a few times and it's held up well since i've put it on,5
8011,for my galaxy nexus it lasts approximately two and a half charges for my phone from a fully charged battery pack,5
8012,the case provides a nice lip around the front to hold the screen protector in place will peel off with the backing,5
8013,this case is one of the best looking cases out there,5
8014,that being said this battery is every bit as good if not better than apple's behemoth,5
8015,these don't hurt my ears like the ones that come with your devices and better in a few ways as well,5
8016,this fits very snugly be careful sliding on if you already have a screen protector and dont want to take it off,5
8017,the highlights for me were the excellent battery life and the fact that it has two usb ports on the top that are 2,5
8018,the case looks good and although i have not dropped my phone while in this case and my phone and case were unscathed,5
8019,this will recharge almost any cell phone tablet mp3 player or whichever usb device they have overnight,5
8020,this item comes in handy when you need to charge your smart phone and not near an outlet,5
8021,it protects well without being too bulky and it also does not interfere with my touch pad capabilities on my phone,5
8022,provides decent protection but if you drop your phone a lot you should probably go for something else,5
8023,this case does a good job of protecting the screen from scratches and the edges of the phone so the glass remains exposed and vulnerable,5
8024,edit i've had the screen protector for a few months now and still working like brand new,5
8025,i would very pleased with the quality of the product and speed of delivery,5
8026,this is the exact same model i have for my iphone 5 and my kindle and not all of them work for both,5
8027,again for the price i think it's a great deal for a 3-pack of clear durable screen protectors,5
8028,it still works great and holds it charge as well as it did when i first made my purchase on amazon,5
8029,the headset is well made and i don't really have too much trouble using the phone,5
8030,its rare to find a cover that protects the front of the phone which many cases don't,5
8031,and of course that assumes you don't need to charge this phone more than once a day,5
8032,the only thing i didn't like about this case was that the color does not match what is displayed online,5
8033,while this is only a leather texture holster it has a nice feel to the touch i am happy with my choice,5
8034,all i can really say is that this case does what it is supposed to do and the price is right,5
8035,but other then that i like the way it feels and i can always find it in my bags and slim enough for my pocket,5
8036,let me tell you this is the best case i've ever had and i've had many,5
8037,feels good on the hands and i did drop my phone a few times and the cover has protected it well,5
8038,i especially appreciate the numbered outside covers on both sides of the protector to keep it from being marred during installation,5
8039,i have been using it for about a month now and i am very pleased with this item for the price especially,5
8040,when i saw the great price there was no way i was paying the high cost of beats or jaybird,5
8041,it's just grippy enough to hold in your hand or between your shoulder and ear,5
8042,the only problem with this case is that i wish it was a little longer but that's just a personal preference,5
8043,it works great and love that it came with a usb cord and the plug for an outlet,5
8044,the only reason i'd recommend another unit is if you are on the road as much as someone like me,5
8045,this is my 5th purchase with anker and i would highly recommend it for anyone that still has a samsung galaxy s,5
8046,i have a slight audio discrimination problem which makes it hard for me to get a fingernail under the port cover,5
8047,the only issue i currently have is that i am going to have to find a case that fits it,5
8048,nice protector case it fits just the right size for my phone perhaps a bit too wide,5
8049,unlike most screen guards i've used it doesn't make my screen dirtier with smudges caused by the tip,5
8050,this item does very well and i recommend it to anyone that is looking for an extra one for the office or traveling,5
8051,then this past week i used it for 5 days now i like it,5
8052,the galaxy note is one of the best phone covers i have owned,5
8053,only thing i wish it would have came with a built in screen protector that is smooth and flawless,5
8054,the only thing i didn't like about this case was that the color does not match what is displayed online,5
8055,droid-x claims video resolution is hd720p and i have no reason to think this is a cheap knock-off,5
8056,despite these cons i think this case is a winner and i just retired my otterbox,5
8057,i was also skeptical about being able to place my phone in and out of my pocket without too much fuss,5
8058,it really allows you to keep the small form factor of the battery pack was suprizing though,5
8059,the fit is perfect and i would definitely buy from anker in the future,5
8060,it's very close to the picture except it looks even better in person than it was in the amazon listing,5
8061,bought for my gf and she loves it fits the phone perfectly and is nice to have pockets for license or whatever,5
8062,can't even tell it's in your ear it's that light,5
8063,i like how the case slightly covers the front edges of the phone which prevent it from being scratched when it falls,5
8064,my iphone 4 is topped off very quickly and i no longer have to grope to find my charger cable,5
8065,that's wonderful when considering the number of devices i have plugged in or the advertisement is misleading,5
8066,the size also makes it really nice to be able to charge two of them at once,5
8067,i have not been able to use my phone when i got that case they love it too,5
8068,with the iphone in the case so you do not have to wait for the battery to recharge,5
8069,i was looking for something that i could use with my phone to watch movies listen to music on,5
8070,also the apple bumper won't cause this film to peel up at the edges because the conflict with the case,5
8071,update okay it's been almost a week now and i am very satisfied with it and highly recommend it,5
8072,i know it does a great many things i have not yet figured out how to use the kickstand part,5
8073,this is a well-built dual-port usb wall charger with good specs and good looks,5
8074,however it does its job well and it's easy to flip open when talking on the phone,5
8075,only problem though is the power button is a little bit difficult to get it absolutely bubble free,5
8076,the dual usb ports is very useful and it is one of the greatest cases i've seen,5
8077,the mophie pushes the speakers from the bottom of the phone making sure it fits properly around the button,5
8078,i love this case and one of few that doesn't make your phone look boring if it's put down,5
8079,it connects reliably to my iphone 5 and so far have had no problems with it,5
8080,went on within seconds looks amazing feels amazing and the best part is that both of these items are cheap,5
8081,updated review i bought this battery because i thought my original battery might be going bad,5
8082,i came to hate the htc phone interface but this one is easy to use goes on smoothly and very fast shipping too,5
8083,i can't really i can't count how many times it has saved me,5
8084,a 2500 mah power bank would only be able to charge an iphone or any similar small electronic device at least a three times,5
8085,what can i say but these are the best cases on the market low profile great feel and amazing looks,5
8086,my dad has had his for over 6 months now and i'm confident to give these headphones 5 stars,5
8087,i do not have a samsung galaxy tab but if i did i would not have that much of an issue with it,5
8088,i bought this for my wife but liked it so much that i purchased several to give to family members,5
8089,i feel it actually makes the phone feel more sturdy in my hand,5
8090,display looks hd clear and does not take away from the beauty of the phone,5
8091,i reccomend this because the buttons are easy to press and all ports and speakers are easily accessible,5
8092,white products are hard to keep white anyway but i didn't like the lack of a screen protector and the unprotected ports,5
8093,i was afraid to buy this extender because of the reviews i have seen all the styli were intact and work as expected,5
8094,the case offers a nice lip around the front to hold the screen protector in place will peel off with the backing,5
8095,i keep one at home and one on my desk at work and enables me to easily see the time,5
8096,i would recommend these screen protectors to anyone who wants to protect thier investment,5
8097,i was skeptical but i now don't need to worry about dropping my iphone anymore,5
8098,this speaker is light enough that you would be able to take advantage of the higher capacity,5
8099,i used the second one for the iphone a few times as well and it is still protecting my phone,5
8100,you get a 3 pack though i am still on the first one out of the package to come off quickly,5
8101,purchased for use in my kitchen bathroom and around the house when doing chores so that i can listen to pandora andi heart radio,5
8102,its perfect for days when i don't want to take a whole tripod with you,5
8103,the screen is well protected in the holster and the case does not interfere at all with the iphone design,5
8104,when i go on vacation however i'm amazed at the number or featuresin this small package,5
8105,i was shocked at the quality of this product especially for the price paid 8,5
8106,have not had battery very long but it seems to be very well made and sturdy,5
8107,i have had the same one on since the day i got my iphone 4 verizon and haven't removed it since,5
8108,it's well worth the money and you won't be let down fast charging on a small light charger,5
8109,the screen is incredible the speakers are loud and clear and the bluetooth allows workouts without wires,5
8110,the motorola roadster 2 paired instantly with my iphone 4s and the battery holds a charge for a long time,5
8111,after using this case for a few days now and i'm pretty impressed,5
8112,i got along with it so well that i decided to buy this instead of the cheap ones,5
8113,fits my epic touch perfect and love the grip it has on my phone i do not get tired of it,5
8114,this case has saved my phone so many times when i have dropped it and the colors are really cute,5
8115,i absolutely love this case just got it today and im impressed,5
8116,i've notice that it takes some doing to get the phone out of my pocket from just that piece,5
8117,i was hesitant because of the cost but this has been one of my favorite case companies for android devices,5
8118,it provides ample protection for my phone and it's the best case i've ever owned,5
8119,generally theravpower knightrider 14000mah external batteryis a very good portable power supply that u can take anywhere and charge your phone,5
8120,there are rubber protective covers over the headphone jack and the charging port so no dust can get inside,5
8121,it stays on really good and has done a great job protecting my phone however the holster took a hit,5
8122,this is being used to charge the powergen pgmpp12000 12000mah external battery pack ihome ihm7 rechargeable mini speaker,5
8123,these are easy to apply do a great job of protecting your phone from drops onto the ground,5
8124,the fit was perfect and so far it protected my phone from a 4 foot drop no problem no dents or marks,5
8125,i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review,5
8126,as far as comfort it took me a while to figure out why it wouldn't charge when plugged in,5
8127,have had it now and used it for about 2 months and can't see any wear and tear,5
8128,moreover the the screen protector is very easy to install and remove if necessary,5
8129,and the navigation key was larger and has the added bonus of answering making calls skipping through my mp3s,5
8130,and since rubber is non-slip it can be a pain to get at depending on the case thickness and design,5
8131,it fits on the screen extremely well and you hardly notice it's there yet protects your phone from bumps and minor drops,5
8132,i received this case just today and was very pleased with how it felt how it was an adorable color,5
8133,this compact dual usb charger does a nice job of charging my iphone 5 and samsung galaxy phones,5
8134,i would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in quintessential surface protection for their devices,5
8135,a bright blue which looks very nice on the phone i am very happy to have it,5
8136,this is a good case for the galaxy s3 phone and it has performed really well with both of those tasks,5
8137,i've never used swype input on the keyboard in the past but i've found them to be too bulky,5
8138,i haven't put it to the test yet but installation was completely painless,5
8139,i love this case and one of few that doesn't make your phone look boring if it's put down,5
8140,it can charge two things at the same time and this was easily the nicest of all,5
8141,otter box is great it has to be the best protection you can have in my opinion,5
8142,but i believe a phone should be able to make it through the day with my phone,5
8143,my phone looks like it doesn't have a case that's bulky,5
8144,i listen to that stuff all the time and now i can do it in my phone and it automatically syncs with my tablet,5
8145,love this case the second i put it on my phone i made sure to glue them again,5
8146,overall i highly recommend these to anyone that wants to protect your smartphone or tablet,5
8147,so this cable has earned a spot in one of the usb ports on my sample was broken and would not charge,5
8148,update i've had this phone for a while now and never a problem,5
8149,i have recieved this case and i must say it is one of the best electronic purchases i made outside of my smartphone,5
8150,this is great a purchase for anyone looking for a replacement charger or just need a longer cord,5
8151,i've got one on my iphone 4s and now on my galaxy s4,5
8152,the only down fall is i can not find a cover like this one for it,5
8153,i've owned several different bluetooth headsets over the years and they were either damaged or lost,5
8154,i also love that it doesn't bulk up the phone but it's got some protection power,5
8155,i ordered this item in august of 2012 and i've been using it for a couple of months and use it daily,5
8156,overall three hours after receiving the items i'm very happy with the design of the case and the feel,5
8157,fits my iphone 5 like a glove and doesn't make your phone bulky,5
8158,there are a number of things to like about this phone too namely 1,5
8159,i absolutely love the slim armor case it is by far my favorite style of phone holder for my car,5
8160,i can slip my iphone 4s inside without having to take off the case because yes it is still that thin,5
8161,very easy to install once there installed you don't even know there's a case on it,5
8162,my droid-x battery is good for about 4-5 hours and it has not ran down to recharge it,5
8163,so far it has protected my phone from several drops and therefore worth it,5
8164,i've purchased many screen protectors in the past and have never been very happy with them,5
8165,the case goes on easy and the buttons are all easy to push and all ports are easily accessible,5
8166,i love the retracting cord and i love that it's been protected superbly thus far,5
8167,customer service sucks but when you get it going it does what its supposed to and only costs a couple of bucks,5
8168,if i had to wish something i just wish the cord was slightly longer for our suvs,5
8169,i have used the clipper for about 3 weeks now and i have seen that this is accurate,5
8170,i loved it so much i had to purchase this one for my self,5
8171,it worked fine with both my iphone 4 and my ipad mini at the same time while traveling in the car,5
8172,never had a chance to use it yet looking forward to place on my phone easy to assemble,5
8173,the opening is cut large enough so that you can use it when you need it the most,5
8174,as i peeled off the cover i pressed the screen protector onto the phone and perfectly aligning it was simple and easy,5
8175,this phone case fit like a glove on the phone and i like the non-slip grip,5
8176,i was a bit worried because it was so cheap but i am very satisfied with this product,5
8177,charges my phone just fine and i don't think it's real leather but no cracks so far,5
8178,i've only had it for a couple of weeks and i've been very pleased with all of them,5
8179,my last case was all silicone and was tough to get out of my pocket and the cutouts for everything are all well positioned,5
8180,i just tried to charge my phone with the case on without any issues,5
8181,this might sound strange but i love the fact that i can listen to my music through it,5
8182,it pairs easily with my ipad and the sound quality is really great for 20 bucks ear pods,5
8183,i ordered these back in april when i got my phone and i couldn't find one with such description,5
8184,i finally ordered this one for my wife's iphone 5c,5
8185,it comes in 2 pieces a soft silicone case and a hard plastic portion that functions as a shell,5
8186,it was so tight on my phone that when i tried to take it off it chipped a piece off of the side,5
8187,good protection i have dropped my phone twice and no damage,5
8188,i have a full beard and i have never had any problems with scratches on my iphones,5
8189,i also like how easy it is to put on the phone and it stands out,5
8190,once it's on you can't even tell it's on my phone blends perfectly,5
8191,if you buy this case you won't be sorry if you choose this case,5
8192,i'd looked at hundreds of cases and finally decided to give this one a try and i am so happy it works great,5
8193,i was happy to find that this case is slim enough that it does not get caught on things as our old one did,5
8194,i ordered a few of these because the price was great and all of the positive reviews it had,5
8195,my favorite thing about it is that i am able to charge my phone while my coworker charged his ipad,5
8196,if you can fit the iphone in your shirt or pants pocket while you talk holding the receiver,5
8197,my dad has battery packs and they aren't nearly as bright and flexible as these,5
8198,i bought the protectors for myself but now i have the iphone 5 and have had issues with store bought car chargers,5
8199,nine-month update i've had this screen protector for a while till i got a case that does not support it,5
8200,build quality is a and it fits the phone perfectly i am very satisfied with it,5
8201,it has a battery status to let you know how much juice you still have to use,5
8202,in my opinion this really is a must have for anyone with a ton of electronics and chargers,5
8203,while the charger may be nice the usb cable that came with my device and i'm ready to power up,5
8204,it adds substantial grip to the phone and protects the phone no glare nor shiny,5
8205,it's certainly not too heavy to carry in a pocket but it is perfect if you are staying with the factory battery,5
8206,keep in mind that this screen protector is a must have for your electronics,5
8207,i'm not good doing this kind of stuffs but when i put on the cover i had to start all over,5
8208,if you don't already have a screen protector on the phone and it guaranteed for life of your phone,5
8209,now that i have mine and have used it for a few days so i dont know how it holds to dropping,5
8210,it looks really nice on my phone and i use it to listen to music,5
8211,it's very easy to apply and remove and protects the back and sides of the phone and provides a nice finish and great feel,5
8212,a great way to charge two devices at one with it,5
8213,i like that because if im out i can clip it to my pants or a part of alanyard,5
8214,i bought this for my brother and he uses it all the time when we are in the car for very long,5
8215,it is a little difficult to put on but it's actually not,5
8216,it just keeps getting better and better and i have not had a problem with it thank you for being honest as trusting,5
8217,the cable served it's purpose well and it's too bad that meego hasn't taken off,5
8218,dried over night and set like it was meant to be but protects the back and sides,5
8219,the cellet bergamo is just what i was looking for to put on my new iphone 5,5
8220,1 google nexus 7 10 microsoft surface pro acer b1 ipod android smartphone samsung galaxy s4 s3 s2 ace note,5
8221,i ordered this for my husband to use and he hasn't had any problems with her case,5
8222,they have a great product that i highly recommend and i have been very happy with this headset,5
8223,a double press of the on off button on the side as opposed to the top,5
8224,after reading reviews for different armband products i came across this one and after reading the reviews decided to buy it,5
8225,i would recommend this product is really good i love it it looks exactly like the picture,5
8226,fits phone great and i have purchased a lot of these bumpers different seller,5
8227,i dropped it on concrete once and there was no damage at all but that's about my limit for scary drops,5
8228,the battery life is great i have only used it for 3 to 4 hours per use,5
8229,comes with everything you need to protect your phone and it looks great as well,5
8230,it fit the note 3 and you are able to carry atm card and license in it too,5
8231,the jawbone ii stays in my ear no problem and is so light weight that i hardly can tell i am wearing it,5
8232,lots of colors loved the variety they fit the phone perfectly and i haven't had a problem,5
8233,i wasn't going to put one on my iphone 4s and one on my girlfriend's iphone 4,5
8234,this case is a slim fit and it fits the phone snugly and won't just pop off like a squishy case,5
8235,purchase for a friend and so far he likes it because it has black hawks colors and it is tough looking,5
8236,the case has held up very well and he likes the look of it and the colors,5
8237,charged it fully right out of the box and was returned to amazon,5
8238,speigen crystal clear screen protectors are the best so when i got my new phone it was a no brainer,5
8239,the case is a perfect fit which allows for easy access to the speakers and the cable outlets,5
8240,this case is very nice nicer than i thought it'd be and it's so much more adorable,5
8241,ive had it over a month and i've dropped my phone soooo many times and this protects it great,5
8242,have been using it for about a little over a month now and it's a great smartphone,5
8243,had is for two years and i am happy to say that this device worked better then expected,5
8244,i buy these and only these for every phone i've had if it was available and it's worth it,5
8245,i've used it several times at school to charge my iphone and ipad at the same time at night,5
8246,i wasn't going to be using it for hours at a time without any discomfort,5
8247,i've not been a fan of skinomi but i took a chance on the cellet headset and i'm very pleasantly surprised,5
8248,although i've only had it a few days but am very impressed with quality and appearance for the note 3,5
8249,i like the way the light changes color to let you know when it is on and what percentage of battery life is left,5
8250,although this is a 2 layer case it is still thin enough to slide into a front or back pocket,5
8251,without ever plugging the device in to charge before use i was able to get 2 items a the cost of one,5
8252,it's nice to use to charge my kindle so i dont have to carry a bag around a bar all night,5
8253,the interchangeable plates are a good feature it is nice to be able to walk around the house and do other things while using them,5
8254,it was slick on the back side and i was looking for something that was 2 pieces and snaps on,5
8255,i also was impressed that i was able to put my case back on,5
8256,i can not emphasize enough how fantastic it is to be able to do what i want on the phone,5
8257,although at times it hangs most of the time it's lock on clear and sharp,5
8258,can charge up two phones at the same time which is about all i could ask of it,5
8259,it has a very nice grips on the sides to hold the phone in place and will not scratch the phone,5
8260,i read tons of reviews and watched the video on how to position it and it went in as advertised,5
8261,but man it took me three tries to figure out what to do with the clasp as i watch videos or skype,5
8262,it is truly crystal clear and you can not tell there is a protector on the case,5
8263,fit perfect phone looks fresh and this cover doesn't take away from the look of this phone or make it bulky,5
8264,this is the perfect case for someone who does not want to ruin there iphone,5
8265,perfect for both men and women it's really well made and i know it will last,5
8266,that is kinda expected if you want to protect your investment especially if you drop your phone,5
8267,at first i wasn't sure about it due to the price but it would have been nice to have one,5
8268,i love how the case is not too bulky and provides adequate protection,5
8269,fits perfectly giving access to all of the buttons and ports are cut out for ease of use,5
8270,if it's someone i don't want to talk on the phone while driving yes i do,5
8271,this charges in only two hours using a standard micro-usb connector no need for any proprietary adapters,5
8272,absolutely beautiful loved the way it fit on the phone and the blue plastic while quite durable is quite thin,5
8273,had the batteries for about 6 months now and it has been great,5
8274,i also have to say that the noise reduction is not as good as my finger i can swype one handed using my thumb,5
8275,the jupiter 787 isn't compact and it is a little heavy but it was expected with a 5200 mah battery,5
8276,nice everything perfect 100 percent she loves it a great case for the money and won't be looking for a replacement anytime soon,5
8277,i need to hold the power button for a few seconds and it starts charging the iphone,5
8278,i have to say this is one of the best cases for the lowest prices,5
8279,when the case is on there's a small opening at the top for putting this on a key ring,5
8280,its great quality ive had it for a long time and having 3 will ensure that,5
8281,defiantly recommended for you only if you have a samsung galaxys ii from at t,5
8282,so easy to use and opens up a whole new world of what android devices can do,5
8283,i was also very impressed with the built in screen protector over my own screen protector,5
8284,i even used it with the single stand on top of my iphone and to keep dust out of the stylus hole,5
8285,i have not had any issues and would recommend it to anyone who has the galaxy s3,5
8286,i had one of these for my iphone 4 and i was amazed at the quality and details,5
8287,i dropped my phone several times while in this case and it did not damage the case or the phone at all,5
8288,i had this case for over a week now and all i can say is you are only making it harder on yourself later,5
8289,update 2 11 2014 this battery pack is still going strong and has saved my device from multiple drops,5
8290,i really like the fact that it has 2 usb ports so i can charge two devices fast,5
8291,there is a lip that protects the screen when the phone is face-down,5
8292,it costs a little more than others like it but it's a great cable and i've bought and tested many,5
8293,well made and attractive i really like the fact that the charger prongs flip close for easy storage,5
8294,i have tried many different brands of screen protectors for my cellular phones,5
8295,i just hope the tech stays so i can use this on my office line at home as well,5
8296,however i've been using it for a few months and it seems to be holding up fine for the couple of days,5
8297,only issue with the magpul is that it does not come with usb chargers cables bases to charge your tablets etc,5
8298,it feels well made has a handy red light that lets you know it is charging-it is the best bang for the buck,5
8299,if you power the device on the leds will light up to indicate the amount of charge left in the powerbank,5
8300,external batteries are essential for people on-the-go and your phone or other small device needs a charge,5
8301,it takes a little bit of effort to take out of the holster just hard to put back in,5
8302,this product does exactly what it is supposed to do works great no issues,5
8303,i've only had this for a couple of years now and i think its the best,5
8304,i was a little concerned this case would add too much bulk to it and keeping its style with the 3 back plates,5
8305,also for the price the case is a great deal for the quality of the product and recived it in a very short time,5
8306,the best part about this charger is that it has two usb ports one emits 2,5
8307,the only con to this product is the weight it is a little heavy but the size is nice,5
8308,my husband and i travel for months at a time and i dont have to remove the back cover,5
8309,disclaimer i received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review and this one was very easy,5
8310,first of all you get two batteries for the price of one and at the promo cost they were basically free,5
8311,it is snug and even dropped my phone a few times and it's still looking good and fitting perfectly,5
8312,i think the case is a little slippery but you can get used to it and it might straighten out over time,5
8313,the case looks nice and has a good feel to it i don't notice that it is not part of the box itself,5
8314,this case is much higher quality than other kits i have purchased in the past these are very good ones and inexpensive,5
8315,the customers really like how easy it is to put the phone into,5
8316,cheap and easy to use works great i would recommend this to buy and share with your friends,5
8317,notes pairs easily with bluetooth devices simply hold the power button until the lights come on about three seconds,5
8318,i also like that it put's out enough power to charge my phone about 6 and a half times,5
8319,the ear speaker is loud even to the point that i don't have to take it off everytime i use this but oh well,5
8320,this is a basic samsung cell phone usb charger and it does it's job of protecting the phone very well,5
8321,what actually makes this the best screen protector i've ever used and it works fantastically with my iphone 5s,5
8322,i buy these and only these for every phone i've had if it was available and it's worth it,5
8323,everyone can not believe i have so many cases and i find this one to be excellent,5
8324,the on switch is touch sensitive so it doesn't need to be because the rubber is in all the right places,5
8325,they fit perfectly and are easy to remove and they are even reusable,5
8326,i love this cable and recommend it highly to anyone who doesn't mind the extra bulk,5
8327,i'm not sure how much it will protect the screen if laid down on the face,5
8328,i recharged the battery per their instructions out of the box it was synched and ready to use within two minutes,5
8329,another improvement i would love to see is a built-in flashlight but it does not have one,5
8330,i bought the slim armor case for my wife's iphone 4 well over a year ago,5
8331,the accessibility of all the buttons and jacks as well as the camera lens flash and speaker on the back,5
8332,i've had mine white for over a month and it hasn't loosened like some cases do,5
8333,for some reason you lose the click you feel when you press the power button on the upper right side of the phone,5
8334,it's so nice to be able to charge my phone while my coworker charged his ipad,5
8335,it fits my phone right and it looks exactly like the picture and i would definitely recommend this especially for teenagers using this phone,5
8336,but for the price you can get a couple of different colors for my other son's and my galaxy iii's,5
8337,not with this product also it is very easy to take on and off,5
8338,i don't even have scuffs or anything because it's not a hard case nor a silicon one it's right in between,5
8339,overall i am really impressed and if you are looking for a case for apple iphone i really recommend this product,5
8340,another advantage is you don't have to think about the battery for the rest of the day without charging my phone,5
8341,haven't used any other car speakerphones but this one is perfect for traveling and should belong in any bag,5
8342,it charges 2 devices at the same time which is very handy,5
8343,it charged my iphone from about 25 % to 100 % in about an hour while in bright sunlight with few clouds,5
8344,i also like that you can use it as a stand-alone fm radio,5
8345,i had lots of questions and their customer service was very patient and understanding,5
8346,my friend loved it im happy with the purchase and my new case,5
8347,i bought 2 of these and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good phone holder,5
8348,i have droped my phone several times and the case has held up and i have used it on number 4,5
8349,easy to put on barely any bubbles if you do it right and last a long time,5
8350,like i have stated before in previous reviews i am no audiophile but i personally think it's worth it,5
8351,that pouch bought on amazon is made for the phone without a case on it while i waited on this case to arrive,5
8352,i have been using this for a couple of years now and it still works,5
8353,lastly i think it is great that i can charge my phone while i am in the shower but others might be,5
8354,to sum it up if you need crazy protection this case isn't going to protect your phone from any damage,5
8355,the joints are all free moving so you don't have to look away from the road to answer,5
8356,now no longer have to remove the case in order to use it with the browser,5
8357,don't be cheap buy two if you have more than one device which needles a charge,5
8358,not only will this will be one of the best purchases that i have made in quite a while love the length of it,5
8359,99 and i wanted to get this as a gift for someone and they seem to enjoy,5
8360,this is a good case for the galaxy s3 phone and it has performed really well with both of those tasks,5
8361,it's not hard to put on or take off for battery access etc,5
8362,lastly i like that you can put the phone face down without worrying about scratching the screen,5
8363,i was skeptical about ordering after reading some of the reviews for this i decided to try it out as well for my iphone 5s,5
8364,very easy to put on fits perfectly and have had it on for over a week now i still love it,5
8365,i've only had it for a couple of months now and use it all the time with my samsung galaxy tab 3 7,5
8366,i've had it now for a few days and it kept locking up when in standby,5
8367,i'm in the gym at least 2-4 times a week and this hasnt given me any problems,5
8368,little on the tight side but it will loosen up over time so don't over stuff it,5
8369,if i leave it in my car all the time so it is there when i need it and it doesn't ask any favors,5
8370,i keep it in my glovebox and use it to power my gps device and cell works great,5
8371,it is a lot bigger then i thought which is nice in my opinion makes it a bit more feminine,5
8372,you can minimize that by putting it at the end of the day your phone is not dead,5
8373,it looks and feels as though i don't have a galaxy s3 or s4 phone so i had to buy my phone cases online,5
8374,it looks very well on the phone and is easy to put on with no hassle,5
8375,the range is really really good and the call quality so far has been fine but i don't make many calls,5
8376,it does indeed provide a full charge for my iphone 5 and it fits like a gove,5
8377,i do sometimes wish it had a little bit more of a friction feel but the sensitivity of touch is maintained,5
8378,i wish it used a micro-usb cable so i didn't have to rely on my own stitch work,5
8379,bought this case for my son who tends to drop his phone a lot,5
8380,i also love that i don't need to carry everything in my wallet,5
8381,my only concern was with getting my iphone out of the case after seeing how nice the install was,5
8382,luck of the draw baby 50 50 either this is one of the good ones and is made solid and strong,5
8383,the hyperion battery for the s4 works better than i thought it would and i have had no problems,5
8384,fits the galaxy s3 perfectly and does not add too much depth to the device,5
8385,the battery has four lights to indicate how much of a charge the powerpak has left in it,5
8386,i like the earpods and would recommend them to anyone looking for phone specific screen protectors,5
8387,you can't even tell there's a case on the phone when i use it,5
8388,i have been using anker batteries for a couple of years now and they consistently deliver high quality solid products,5
8389,this is a little bulky but i'd rather it be tight than loose,5
8390,actually this went on fine but when i put on the screen it just fits perfectly,5
8391,when the case arrived i didn't expect it to be as nice as it was,5
8392,it is very easy to take the phone out of the skin,5
8393,it took my iphone 3gs from 6 % all the way to 100 % if you're not using it a lot,5
8394,basically we can use any usb cords including the one that it comes with doesn't do a great job,5
8395,i like that you press a button on the side of the headset and when i dial out it automatically connects,5
8396,i used this case for a really long time and i love it,5
8397,the cover protects the cell so well my daughter loves the color and the protection that it provides is unequal,5
8398,purchased this as a replacement for the original ear buds that came with my samsung infuse smartphone they are pretty okay,5
8399,i rarely use my phone driving but it's nice to have the option for an alternate speaker,5
8400,however i was pleasently surprise with the features and performance of this product overshadow my disappointment in the manufacturer,5
8401,all products seem to work fine had no problems with any of the buttons or with the fingerprint reader,5
8402,9830 it has a rechargeable battery that charges with a standard micro usb cable one is provided with this battery,5
8403,it has good protection for everything but the front of the phone but enough for the whole screen,5
8404,the phone fit in perfect and easy to get in and out now but will not fall out on accident,5
8405,if you do order the office kit make sure you order the one that's sold by and fulfilled by amazon,5
8406,i like that it comes with its own power cord so you don't have to worry about them falling out,5
8407,the otterbox defender appears to be the best case out there for the samsung s4 and has such a reasonable price,5
8408,there are 2 belt loops that i don't use and battery life is very satisfactory,5
8409,i was looking for a smart looking case to keep my new iphone safe and free of scratches,5
8410,the noise cancellation is very good and it has a great battery life but it is great to have this to travel,5
8411,i really like that both the top and bottom are open so i have full access to the power button and ports,5
8412,the screen guard is easy to put on and take off the case without a major fight on my hands,5
8413,other than that i am very satisfied with the htc one m8 and will continue to use it,5
8414,i wish the battery lasted a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with your iphone,5
8415,it works with generic lightning cables and goes in and out of the case not carefully at all too many times,5
8416,store it anywhere it doesn't take up much space on my nightstand when not in use,5
8417,i also like to see how much power it has left 100 % 75 % 50 % 25%3 charger for device could be smaller,5
8418,i've dropped my phone a few times and the case has come to the rescue,5
8419,it's great to be able to charge both my phone and kindle fire at the same time,5
8420,the battery can be removed when you don't want to take a star away for this one,5
8421,the asymmetric shape of the usb plug makes it easy to tell if the device is connected properly,5
8422,this was inexpensive and now i can hook up my phone via bluetooth or computer as well,5
8423,i am an htc one x user and i can honestly say that these are the nicest screen protectors that i've ever used,5
8424,it was a gift for my wife she just love it so much that i bought 2 of them,5
8425,otherwise i have absolutely no complaints about the quality of the nexus one's being sold lately,5
8426,i do love this case and i'm going to order another one for my iphone 4s,5
8427,this card is highly recommended especially if you can get it for a fraction of the retail price,5
8428,i will update my review once i have used the case for about a week and so far so good,5
8429,i plan on buying a second one so i can keep one in my purse,5
8430,this case fits very closely is extremely thin and doesn't get in the way even if you are wearing a hat or eyeglasses,5
8431,i did mow the lawn using these bluethooth headphones and was very happy with the overall quality and protection it gave for her iphone,5
8432,my wife drops her phone all the time and it is way easier for him,5
8433,its not a perfect fit but it will do the job it's meant to do,5
8434,i really like this one thinking about getting another one for my sistersince is not that expensive,5
8435,so its so far so good and i'm thinking of getting one for my office as well,5
8436,i dropped it a few times and it has held up,5
8437,i am not one of those people who is hard on my phone and this is pretty durable,5
8438,to activate the battery press the button on the top face where the iflash logo is,5
8439,the clear screen protector is better than the one that came free with my phone case,5
8440,don't try this at home it has more than enough power to charge two iphones within same charge,5
8441,i can stick my phone in the slot even with the case on it and it's easier to hold while doing so,5
8442,for the price this battery is better than the one that came free with my phone case,5
8443,the usb has lights to indicate the charge levels and it is so convenient to check notifications without pulling out my s4,5
8444,the case fits perfectly and it looks like i don't have a case on it,5
8445,i got this for my tracfone and the case is a perfect fit for the case therefore reducing the chances of it sliding out,5
8446,why pay 30 to 40 dollars when you can get the same thing for a better price,5
8447,it is easy to remove if you have to change the battery the case comes off easily enough,5
8448,i do hear some coloring in upper mids but i think it will be perfect for when he starts his work out program,5
8449,i have quite a few easyacc accessory items and i can say that i have never been displeased with something that they put out,5
8450,in non-direct sunlight this is the best screen protector life to date i have used,5
8451,it's perfect for my car and works great with my iphone 5 and also protects my phone well,5
8452,it's really convenient so i don't have to worry about extra cable from regular headphones,5
8453,for the price and the quality of construction i could not be more pleased with this phone cover i love it,5
8454,the manufacturer sent me a review unit in exchange for a fair and honest review and this one was very easy,5
8455,if you prefer tiny light devices then maybe this isn't for you but if you want something non cumbersome handsome this case is great,5
8456,but overall i've had the item for over a week now and all i can say these are excellent,5
8457,all the callers i talked to could not believe i was on a bluetooth headset and that was while driving in a car too,5
8458,bought this for my phone in my car all the time and it does not reduce car battery,5
8459,it works and that's why i bought this and it works like a charm,5
8460,i got this for my iphone 4 and loved it so i got this for my mom,5
8461,after using it for a while i found it to be extremely fast and very useful,5
8462,oh and it turns off after a little bit so you don't have to constantly clean one side with a q-tip,5
8463,the are just like the originals ones that came with the phone unless you root the phone,5
8464,it might last even longer for you if you don't like the person next to you seeing what your doing,5
8465,you'd be hard pressed to tell there is a screen protector on my galaxy note ii with t-mobile,5
8466,lastly this model has 16 gb onboard and i was able to buy brand new on sale for 186,5
8467,dauhter's burning battery from music and my husband and i are always fighting for the charge cable on the couch,5
8468,i'm a guy that likes to keep my phone in my pocket and it slips in and out easily,5
8469,i'm very pleased with this case and for the price it lasted longer than expected,5
8470,i either lost the previous headsets or forgot to take them out of my pocket the ear buds would fall off,5
8471,this case has been through hell in the last year or so and they all have their pros and cons,5
8472,the hands free is terrific pull it out of my pocket and pop it on the mount,5
8473,i have the s3 with an otterbox as well and there are a couple of nice side benefits with the design,5
8474,i received it quickly and i didn't have to buy a new charger,5
8475,the incipio uses a soft-touch material on the hard plastic which makes it easy to remove any bubbles which i only had one,5
8476,the charger is just a tad larger and heavier than the others but it also has more capacity and power,5
8477,this battery is flawless and is by far the best one i have purchased,5
8478,go for this one there is no reason you should not enjoy this case,5
8479,the case came sooner than expected and i love the look of the slim snap on cases and this one is lasting very well,5
8480,the only complaint i could come up with is if you want to use this with a hotel's tv for instance,5
8481,i had no problems with this and found it easy to use and store away when not using,5
8482,case fits well you do have to make sure you are in a dust free environment or as close to it,5
8483,sure enough he managed two hours of talk time and all you have to do is change batteries,5
8484,looks cute shipped fast and i feel like it will really protect very well,5
8485,i rarely give such a rating but this is one of those instances where you really get what you pay for,5
8486,it's sturdy durable and i love that you can charge two devices at the same time,5
8487,i own about 5 cased for my s3 and this is by far one of the best batteries out there of any capacity,5
8488,i have used several of them over the years i have had multiple phones between me and my daughter,5
8489,but this case holds all the attachments and it would be nice if there were a version that had 2x 2,5
8490,great for long travel got one for each of my kids to match their mp3 players,5
8491,i have had this item for some time now and have yet to lose any of the jewels,5
8492,this charger has a micro-usb port on the side,5
8493,it really looks great and lots of people have asked me where i got this and pointed them here,5
8494,i've tried a couple chargers but for one reason or another the opportunity never really presented itself,5
8495,it's sturdy but bendable it's just what i was looking for slim but with a lip over the screen,5
8496,i added a key ring to the top of the case and the bottom that snaps together seems well connected,5
8497,this is the third anker portable charger that i have bought over the years much like pens and socks,5
8498,the speaker uses a rechargeable internal battery that can be charged via a usb cord and i would highly recommend it,5
8499,i can still slide it into my back pocket if i need to charge on the go,5
8500,i am a bit of a geek when it comes to things like this he loves it,5
8501,i can easily get a full day out of it and i've only had it about 3 days,5
8502,this is a great travel charger once you get the hang of it though it is easy,5
8503,i've tested a lot of battery packs and this one stands out for both looks and performance,5
8504,he has not used it as yet but i am sure it will happen as even the mighty verizon it happens,5
8505,on the side is the iclever name and logo and on the back is the power adapter port and specifications,5
8506,i have been wanting to get a tempered glass screen protector for the following reasons and i am so happy i did,5
8507,this is the battery pack you want to take with you when you travel or evento just stick in your purse,5
8508,although i initially had some doubts after using the product for a few days i am quite impressed with it,5
8509,having received this product i wish i had known about this thing before,5
8510,easy to forget you have on and the sound is loud clear and crisp just absolutely unbelievable from such a small unit,5
8511,the phone feels great in my hand and it feels great,5
8512,hopefully otterbox beefed up that clip for the iphone 4 and 5 and to date this case is my absolute favorite,5
8513,as i stated i think this is one of the best purchases i've ever made,5
8514,the suction cup holds this firmly in place but is easy to remove from the holster but fits securely in it,5
8515,overall i am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this case for the quality materials and slim design,5
8516,the commuter version corrected this for and i feel that my phone is completely safe in this case,5
8517,bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it and has told her friends about the otter box,5
8518,she has had it for over 2 years now and i still love it,5
8519,it holds a charge well and can charge two phones at the same time which is great way to meet people at the airport,5
8520,i've had an otter box on my phone for almost a week i absolutely love it,5
8521,this rubber case is entirely black and no need to worry about cords running on the treadmill etc,5
8522,even if you don't use the original cable that came with my samsung note 3,5
8523,my original cord split open and i was afraid i'd have to get another one,5
8524,i just might order some more just to make sure i don't forget to take it with me,5
8525,i still have them even after i dropped my phone a few times and haven't had any issues with it yet,5
8526,disclaimer i received this pack in exchange for an honest review which you have just read,5
8527,i've never tried to hook it up to my nearly-dead gs3,5
8528,amazing how it stays in place on textured dash it was a bit hard to tell if it was lined up correctly,5
8529,the performance of the 10000mah intocircuit has got to be one of the best modern day gadgets accessories to date,5
8530,i have dropped my phone several times since i got it and it has survived a few drops,5
8531,the only thing i could complain about is that the case is a print and dust magnet especially in black,5
8532,fits great looks great has nice grips on the side to make it easy to remove the tape,5
8533,this is a cute phone case i still have it and use it for my mp3 player,5
8534,amazing it worked great with no problem all i have to do is fold the headset and it is turned off,5
8535,it is true that the battery is a bit thicker than the one pictured which i dont mind at all,5
8536,my wife recently fell in love with this phone after a couple of hours of use,5
8537,happy with the purchase and would buy it again if i was into this type holder anymore,5
8538,good protection and other than increasing the size of the phone dramatically so it was still reasonable,5
8539,the black picks up finger oils a little bit when you first get it but the white part gets dirty in no time,5
8540,the enerpak maximum comes with a micro usb cable you can recharge the iphone as well as the ends,5
8541,when i first read the reviews i knew i had to get a trident case for it,5
8542,they are well worth the price now i don't need to carry around a charge cable,5
8543,i am using this to make a pair of bluetooth headphones and i saw the reviews for these headphones so i bit,5
8544,very cute case i used this for about a year and it still feels brand new,5
8545,i love you can power two devices at the same time while remaining this small if possible,5
8546,doesn't add very much width either and it's thinner than i thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise,5
8547,i like how it covers the whole side top and bottom of the phone but still protects and fits in the dock perfectly,5
8548,so far the sound quality is good and so is the product for the price,5
8549,at the risk of sounding picky this is the third case i have gotten for my iphone 5 so far,5
8550,these are such a good thing to have if you are trying to preserve your original iphone 3gs or 3 g,5
8551,i notice no speed difference between this and the cable that came with it and with one i already had,5
8552,i'm wondering how long this screen protector is going to be my new brand to go to,5
8553,so it has more than enough power to charge my phone multiple times,5
8554,don't underestimate its small size it has very good sound quality and the voice side is also very good,5
8555,it's easy to charge and i like that you can use this with almost any case,5
8556,case fits the phone perfectly and allows you to see the screen as crisply as without,5
8557,i am very happy with this product and the price was right on,5
8558,no issue at all it lasts at least as long as the oem probably a bit longer and are way cheaper,5
8559,my phone has fallen a couple of times and the phone is still perfect,5
8560,we got this for our daughter and it has proven to be much better than the old phones,5
8561,my phone feels very protected and the case is very sturdy will protect my precious new phone,5
8562,it came real fast and it fit my note 2 with a case leather wallet in the carry pouch,5
8563,i received this on time but i haven't used it yet but i love this case it is awesome and available for much handling,5
8564,bottom line for under 10 this is probably the best case i have ever bought at anyprice,5
8565,still it is small lightweight and portable and does a great job of protecting my wife's phone,5
8566,i have a spigen neohybrid case on my white iphone 5 and this thing looks nice on it,5
8567,the screen does deactivate when we use the phone like it's supposed to and you certainly can not complain about the price,5
8568,it scanned perfectly and i have had no issues with any of my cables hooking up to my phone,5
8569,great productthis cable is well made and does the job of charging without complaint,5
8570,the new trent powerpak did successfully charge both my ipad and iphone 5 at the same time but this one works,5
8571,works great and was very easy to install on my htc evo 4 g lte and an apple ipod 7th generation,5
8572,it charges the battery and the phone at the same time granted you need loose pockets for this,5
8573,i avoided this design because of the hole in the back to show the apple symbol and i love them all,5
8574,a very nice case i bought for my samsung galaxy s2 fit perfect and extends my usage at least double,5
8575,i purchased the trexcell samsung galaxy nexus 3800mah extended battery which makes it significantly fatter than a typical smart phone,5
8576,just switched from an iphone to the samsung galaxy s4 and also put a otterbox case on it,5
8577,some people mention a rear notification light being covered but i haven't found a bluetooth headset that i love yet,5
8578,apps migrating over from apple products some of the apps i use now then and just leave the rest alone,5
8579,so this particular charger only a little bigger than a deck of cards or a slim pocket camera,5
8580,get all of these products and you will be a happy camper with the protection it provides,5
8581,they even gave me a free screen protector with this case but it will definitely protect the phone if it's dropped,5
8582,i would recommend this if you're looking for a slim case for my gs3,5
8583,it's easy to tell this is a quality product from a known company,5
8584,i think i'm going to buy a second one for the inevitable moment that it breaks somehow,5
8585,i would say the only con is that it is a bit scratchy when i wear it directly against my skin,5
8586,with my iphone 3gs i thought it was because my phone was defective and needed to be insured,5
8587,there is a nice raised lip around the screen to protect the iphone when it's placed face-down on a table,5
8588,however there was a bit of trouble with the volume i couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work on my siii,5
8589,i purchased the trexcell samsung galaxy nexus 3800mah extended battery which makes it significantly fatter than a typical smart phone,5
8590,and frankly once it's paired it doesn't need to be because the rubber is in all the right places,5
8591,it is a good quality product and i will recommend it to people who want to add style to their life,5
8592,you need to repair every time you want to use it or charge it while driving,5
8593,in addition to working as a charger it also has a built in flashlight double tap the power button to activate,5
8594,2 make sure to plug the usb part of the charger into the adapter so you can charge the juicepack independently of your computer,5
8595,this is not the first time i have purchased new trent products before and they are yet to disappoint me,5
8596,this is a sleek case that adds very little bulk to the phone and supplies protection,5
8597,this was intended as a stop gap case because it was cheap and looked like it was well built,5
8598,the imp70d is a solid external battery that you can charge from a usb port i use it for my ipads and iphones,5
8599,it arrived on time and i love the way it looks on my phone,5
8600,the second headset works great sounds great and now i can listen to music or youtube without having to plug in headphones,5
8601,i was surprised something under 5 could be so great but it fits the nexus 5 absolutely perfectly,5
8602,i will update this review if my opinion changes but right now i'm with the majority of folks here this looks great,5
8603,when you set the phone screen side down the screen doesn't touch the surface of whatever you laid it on,5
8604,when i go on walks am able to place my phone in and out of a pocket,5
8605,these cases tend to push up on the edge of the screen and this also is a great help,5
8606,9to5cables's dual usb car charger is a great addition to my samsung note ii,5
8607,i haven't used it yet because i bought it as a back up but havent really had to use it much,5
8608,great case saved my note 3 a few times and this case protected my phone,5
8609,once i used it i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices is increasingly becoming a major hassle,5
8610,the review title says it all 8212 i bought one of these for myself and one for my aunt,5
8611,and i still have the case on the phone so i didn't get much use out of it,5
8612,that is really a cool feature because you do not have to take up separate outlets to do it,5
8613,i like this case alot easy to take on and off and it has a great grip,5
8614,i am able to use these with my phone as well,5
8615,still i think it's a great buy for the price,5
8616,i'v dropped my phone a few times since getting it and there was no damage to the case or the phone,5
8617,i have the samsung droid charge and that is about as big as the lip on the diztronic case was,5
8618,the case also provides a good grip and the raised edge around the screen is only about 1 to 2 mm tall,5
8619,it's a great idea however it's not wide enough to give it a more coverage of the screen,5
8620,i personally think that this is the best phone out there,5
8621,it barely adds any bulk on to the phone and all the ports and speakers and lenses are fully exposed,5
8622,my oem back had the button break so i took a chance on these and they did not disappoint,5
8623,so i currently have it in an otterbox defender case and it's a perfect fit inside this holster,5
8624,with low usage possibly for two days before having to re-charge and for me thats fine,5
8625,i have had this on my iphone for about a week and it works well,5
8626,plus i have a bunch of them so when i was asked to review a waterproof case i thought,5
8627,the light knows when you are getting near the phone because it doesn't change the responsiveness of the screen at all,5
8628,the battery is identical to the one i received with my phone but they work,5
8629,the leather back case is by far the best i've ever used,5
8630,it provides a fair amount of protection without being too large,5
8631,34 i really like that attitude and their willingness to stand behind their product and new trent did a great job standing behind theirs,5
8632,it works as expected no issues so far and charges my phone as quickly as the wall charger,5
8633,realistically most people will use an ac wall charger or vehicle charger to recharge the iflash 4400,5
8634,another bonus is that i don't have to carry a purse and i have everything i need,5
8635,i just wanted chime is as well that i'm very pleased with especially the way each port is labelled,5
8636,i have a single dock also just for a back up just in case something happens to my main case,5
8637,i have a monoprice 5000mah battery that i've used for a couple of years w o any problem,5
8638,this is one of the better ones i've had a chance to install it i will update this review,5
8639,the pink isn't quite as hot as the picture shows but it's a good idea of what they look like,5
8640,my wife liked this one because of the color but it turned out to be almost like a peach color,5
8641,the quality of this purchase for the price can not be beat and the delivery was before my expected date,5
8642,i haven't tried any other cases i just know what i look for in a phone case because i hate bulky thick cases,5
8643,the belkin grip candy sheer case and the screen protector did not go exactly edge to edge,5
8644,i have the note 2 and i couldnt ask for a better product to easy on east off,5
8645,has just enough of a lip to protect the screen if it lands or is set on its face,5
8646,with a fully battery i was able to charge my nexus 5 and g pad on one charge with no sweat,5
8647,i wasn't sure about it due to the price but it would have been nice to have one,5
8648,the buds are larger than others i have used and my ipad takes 1,5
8649,3 the holster is very well made and holds the phone in place nice and tight,5
8650,it has turned out to be better than the one i have at home that i paid 150,5
8651,all and all i would still recommend this to anyone in need of a high quality screen protector,5
8652,i do feel though that this case is a winner and does a great job protecting my phone,5
8653,now i have a charger in my kitchen as well as in my bedroom for quiet listening playing games at night,5
8654,the bumper guards are awesome especially since i've dropped the phone many times without cracks or damages on the phone,5
8655,i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a case for their lg g2,5
8656,i was supplied a sample product for test and evaluation and i promised that my review is fair and honest,5
8657,the cheap wally world receive adapter is very similar in size and weight of the standard htc thbt,5
8658,this is one of the best screen protectors i've ever purchased after about a dozen of different brands,5
8659,also was able to use it for my ps3 but i use it on my phone when i got it new,5
8660,microphone recording quality i use siri quite a bit on my phone the background widget layout etc,5
8661,the black matte used on the back of the case address the slippery nature of the phone's plastic,5
8662,i've owned the new trent imp70d for over 6 months and it's not scratched up at all,5
8663,i think these things worked just fine i haven't had any issues with this charger at all,5
8664,it comes with a mini-usb cable as well as a carrying pouch that will hold both charger and cable,5
8665,it charges my galaxy note phone just as well as the original that came with my phone and works the same too,5
8666,all in all this is a great case if you're looking for an extra oem data sync charging cable,5
8667,i've had other cover films before but this was by far the easiest guard screen i ever put on,5
8668,and as soon as i got it i took it out of the box when trying to put it together,5
8669,there 8217s also a micro usb input port for charging the power bank,5
8670,i used mine for my ipad and it's really cute it's silicone and wraps around your case front to back,5
8671,i often need to charge it in the car using the standard usb connection,5
8672,i would recommend this to my friends and family members than i call,5
8673,the design of the vent component is ingenious and it works well with my droid bionic with the case on it,5
8674,it's not bad though allowing free access to all the ports and the color looks great on top of the white,5
8675,i purchased two onite batteries and charger for my new samsung galaxy s3 since this one worked so well,5
8676,this dual-purposeampen new hybrid 2-in-1 stylusis what brought me back to buy this for my galaxys iii,5
8677,it is very thin and allows you to slide the phone in and out of the holster when it is needed,5
8678,whenever the battery on your device does down you have to plug it in first turn it on and then pair it,5
8679,it fits properly into my iphone 4s and i don't feel it i do not use a case,5
8680,after having had a few different ones this one is by far the best one i have used so far,5
8681,she has the iphone 5 and i have to say i am very pleased with the quality,5
8682,it is the main app on your phone that allows you to control the volume and the on off button with minimal effort,5
8683,i love the design its not to big and it fits the phone perfectly allowing for full access to the buttons and touch screen,5
8684,since this headphone set has a built-in microphone and the normal bluetooth functions for receiving calls,5
8685,so it's nice to have a clip so i don't have to hunt down the charger,5
8686,to charge this battery plug it into a computer usb port or into the wall via the included wall outlet adapter,5
8687,i am very pleased with this case and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap yet durable iphone case,5
8688,it is a little bigger than twice the size of the stock battery with a much larger battery piggy backing on it,5
8689,the power support film really does a great job of keeping unwanted noise like wind out,5
8690,this is a great looking wallet well put together and looks like you would have paid 20 or more for it,5
8691,the flip-out microphone arm makes it very easy to turn on and off by just flipping the mini boom mic,5
8692,i recommend buying this product if you want to keep the slim profile of the iphone 5,5
8693,the only thing it needs is the ability to charge both the devices up to 100 % using the pack,5
8694,i loved mine so mine so much that i bought two for each of my cars,5
8695,the quality is top notch all the cut-outs are perfect and the buttons are all covered,5
8696,it is extremely versatile since it charges basically anything that uses a usb cable to charge the the battery this works with,5
8697,i bought two of these and it has given new life to my creative player making it bluetooth capable,5
8698,i have a cigarette lighter charger from an old phone that fits and keep that handy,5
8699,the power bank is only a little bigger than a deck of cards and it's got a impressive power capacity,5
8700,the case is perfect flexible and has a nice look and feel to it,5
8701,just be careful when taking the phone out of your pocket when you pull it out,5
8702,too scared to try my keys so i don't think i'll ever need to use the other two,5
8703,looks exactly as described fits my iphone 4s perfectly and the price can't be beat,5
8704,i have dropped my phone with these cases before and it has protected my phone from day one and never let me down,5
8705,if you want a flexible case that adds little to no bulk while adding a ton of protection,5
8706,i'm confident that it will protect my phone from a lot of abuse so i bought my wife one,5
8707,i love love this case so much that i bought one for my wife's car and iphone 4s cell phone,5
8708,very very happy would give 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 it's just amazing for the cost,5
8709,i just wanted something cheap and small to keep in my purse for when i might need it,5
8710,6 amps plus it has a usb port to charge your phone as well,5
8711,i'm glad i will now have something that will protect my phone from drops or anything that i can throw at it,5
8712,belkin even thoughtfully included little rubber feet on the bottom to keep it secure on almost any smooth surface,5
8713,i have upgraded to the galaxy s3 and the first thing i did was upgrade all the way to wp8,5
8714,and as for this anker walkpower i'll be buying another one the same exact one lol,5
8715,the price is very reasonable and i've dropped my phone soooo many times and this protects it great,5
8716,i have been looking for a case to protect your phone this is the way to go,5
8717,2-in-1 stylus micro-knit tip and fineball penrating 5 out of 5 starsdual purpose charger powers tablet and phone at once,5
8718,this is the best screen protector i have ever had and no air bubbles,5
8719,as far as customer service goes i can honestly say i have never had an earpiece fit better than this,5
8720,this is all fine as long as that is what you are looking for then this belkin grip is definitely for you,5
8721,what really impressed me was the fact that the case is thinner than the gorilla boxes,5
8722,the case fits very good was easy to put on feels good in hand,5
8723,i think you would probably see it even if it wasn't part of an amazon flash deal,5
8724,the case will not begin charging the iphone until you push the on off switch for a sec to get a battery feedback pulse,5
8725,it is clean no scratches no deformation and best of all it fits all docks including the hd station and vehicle mount,5
8726,in all this is one of the best chargers i have owned,5
8727,already came half way charged and so i gave it to my 21 year old daughter and she just loved it,5
8728,i loved this product so much that i ordered another one for my daughter to put in her car,5
8729,literally doubling the size of the phone which is a good and bad,5
8730,29 in lightning port gps no cellular versions have gps samsung galaxy note 10,5
8731,not a case that you should plan to take off and put on but are snug on your phone,5
8732,what can you say the case is one of the best i've bought and its my first smartphone,5
8733,the powerpak turns itself on automatically when a device is plugged in and off when the device is charged or the powerbank is empty,5
8734,the motorola roadster 2 paired instantly with my iphone 4s and the battery holds a charge for a long time and works great,5
8735,it was also a pain to get my phone in and out of a pocket or into a leather waist cellphone pouch,5
8736,it is small and unobtrusive so i can use it in the evening while in bed without worrying about the charge,5
8737,they hold well to my head and block a lot of external noise and they are extremely comfortable,5
8738,when i am at school i don't want to have to replace it or replace a screen,5
8739,the cover for the case is clear so you can see they phone through it,5
8740,i'm not often low on battery life with my phone but when i do i get compliments all the time,5
8741,didn't happen with the same case i bought for my daughter and she is very please with it,5
8742,the screen protector works nice and it fits perfectly on my sprint samsung epic 4 g,5
8743,glass i had an n97-mini for a couple of months and the longer i have it the more the matte back grows on me,5
8744,no the apple iphone 4s has glass on the front and the back on top of the screen protectors,5
8745,it does take away from the look and feel of it its a really nice rich looking case,5
8746,these buttons really add a little something extra to the face of the phone and the buttons don't work while on call,5
8747,been using this for over a year i can confidently say that the storm is the true winner,5
8748,since this case must plug into the lightning port on the back of the car yes our car has 2 cigarette port chargers,5
8749,i found myself liking the fit even after using it for a week now and can't find a single flaw,5
8750,i have had it only a week but it was easy to install and it is still clear after many months of usage,5
8751,very nice finish on the product and it seems to be good enough quality to last a while,5
8752,i have a bad habit of misplacing my cell phone in my purse while i go shopping or running errands,5
8753,there is no question that this is the best screen protector i have ever used and i have been through many,5
8754,this phone case looks good and doesn't add more bulk to your phone and fits snug,5
8755,i have several diff cases for my phone and this screen protector does its job,5
8756,best of all it is easy to carry in the pocket purse or jacket,5
8757,the case is raised a bit above the screen so if you drop it from a ten story building but honestly what really will,5
8758,its a very good item for my new phone and i would recommend it to anyone wanting to purchase a car charger,5
8759,i am quite pleased with the quality of this case it doesn't get much better than this battery cover replacement,5
8760,its a cute case and it is a great deep color,5
8761,the powergen is great for me since it has two usb ports obviously you can use the charger for two items,5
8762,there is no question that this is the best screen protector that i have ever used,5
8763,i love this case it fits perfect on the phone and i couldn't feel one side from the other to silence it,5
8764,a very sturdy detachable carabineer is included which allows you to carry the charger and its charging cable,5
8765,this case was perfect the fit is perfect and it does not make it bulky,5
8766,slim sleek and doesn't take away from the feel of the iphone itself,5
8767,i am very happy with the product and i will buy this product again when i need to replace these,5
8768,when i'm in meeting's no one can tell that i am on a wireless headset,5
8769,9 and weighing about 4 ounces it's small enough to carry around in a computer bag or purse,5
8770,this particular screen protector is without a doubt the best phone case on the market for the galaxy note 2,5
8771,i also like the fact that it has two ports for charging one at 1mw and one at 2mw,5
8772,it looks great and seems to really offer a good amount of protection while still being fairly slim,5
8773,i like this little case for when i go out and don't want to carry a purse,5
8774,a big problem i have with most cases is that they don't slip in out of your pocket with ease,5
8775,i have gotten phone cases for my iphone 4s that didn't seem to fit which talkie tech did replace without hassle,5
8776,it is hands-down the best screen protectors for the price have great customer service,5
8777,the best of all is that i got them for a steal and they work and sound okay,5
8778,even with a case on i was able to get the full trade in value for it,5
8779,if you're like me you have multiple devices that you need to power at the same time,5
8780,i highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a cute case for your iphone,5
8781,case is not bulky and doesn't mask the design of your iphone and makes it easier to handle the cell phone,5
8782,this case fits my iphone 4 perfectly and doesn't really tarnish its looks,5
8783,i know logitech and have used a lot of parts ordered online and this is one of the nicer ones i've received,5
8784,0 out of 5 stars this is one of the most value money phone for android,5
8785,this however does not affect the camera so i have no problem with that and i'm very happy with it,5
8786,this one i don't have to worry as much when the kids are playing on their ipods and suddenly one dies,5
8787,the buttons are cute and its a snug fit on my phone much more so than my old cruzerlite case,5
8788,after reading all the reviews on these i decided to give them a try again after fully charging them,5
8789,they're great if you wear glasses because of the way they fit rather than any sound quality issue,5
8790,the only downside of this case is that it barely adds any bulk to the phone itself,5
8791,i try to use my tablet when i am taking notes,5
8792,i have purchase 2 different cases for this phone and this one is the one i like the most,5
8793,they are even marked so you don't have to constantly swap out sd cards or batteries,5
8794,i always carry my phone in my pocket and this does an excellent job of protecting the screen on my new moto x,5
8795,i too was concerned that it would be a little better protected than before,5
8796,the galaxy note iii with an otterbox case is a tight fit for my samsung galaxy note 3,5
8797,the multiuse worked well as i was able to pair with my moto droid with no problems,5
8798,i love it well worth the money i would definitely recommend this product mostly for using with your existing chargers,5
8799,the fit is also perfect and the pack comes with everything you need to install the screen and keep an iphone safe,5
8800,the case has lots of protection and feels like it will last longer than the thin ones,5
8801,i am very pleased and plan on getting another one for my wife's car once we upgrade her phone,5
8802,for years i've been looking for a bluetooth headset that will work well with the palm treo,5
8803,one hard piece is for the front of your phone without being too imposing,5
8804,i still feel like it will do a fine job keeping the phone from getting scratched and beat up looking,5
8805,it fully charged no note 3 from 80 % to 100 % in 48 minutes using the 2,5
8806,easy to put on barely any bubbles if you do it right and last a long time,5
8807,this is why i only wear them a few hours at a time and have yet to get the low battery warning,5
8808,for what you paid for you will be surprised at the results if you've tried other mounts,5
8809,the phone is completely secure in the case easy to access and the case isn't slippery or hard to handle,5
8810,i am hard on phones and i put them in the same camp as skinomi absolutely amazing,5
8811,it's so nice that you don't have to open the usb lid which makes for keeping my phone waterproof,5
8812,i'm rough on phone cases and this is the one that i settled on,5
8813,however seller included tool and replace the back of the iphone is not very visible on black iphone 5,5
8814,they are the same and work like the one that came with the phone so that's a plus m,5
8815,i have been very impressed with all the amazonbasics products i've tried have been well made and great bargains,5
8816,it provides very good protection but does add a little bulk to the device but it's well worth it,5
8817,it's kind of unattractive but that's a price i'm willing to pay to get a phone that'll last all day,5
8818,i am very happy with this charger and not having to use a micro usb cable instead of the apple lightning cable,5
8819,not hard to put on just take your time and make sure you have it on your phone,5
8820,either i had to take the case off the phone before placing the phone in the cradle and take it out,5
8821,i really like that the gel does not allow the phone to slide easily from where it is placed,5
8822,even with the antenna broken off the unit continues to work just as well as the stock battery that came with my s4,5
8823,i like the fact that the cable is long enough so that i can be sitting comfortable at my chair or couch,5
8824,i feel madly in love with this case from the start especially for the price point,5
8825,by some accounts the silicone covered buttons on the otterbox are a design flaw that i couldn't overlook,5
8826,even at that i find that i only have to charge my phone at work and it works perfectly for me,5
8827,i should have waited before reviewing because the product turned out to be defective which it wasn't,5
8828,my 5 year old borrows it all the time and so far so good not having any of the issues mentioned,5
8829,i have droped my phone a few times and this case protected my phone,5
8830,it fits nice and tight so i don't worry about it falling and hitting the ground either,5
8831,this is one of the best compact bluetooth speakers that i have tested and reviewed for the iphone 5s it apparently isn't,5
8832,i also love that it doesn't bulk up the phone but it's got some protection power,5
8833,you won't regret buying these especially if you like to have a variety of cases for your cell as i do,5
8834,i was able to use the kindle with the power bank attached and recharging at the same time,5
8835,applied easily and is so clear you can't even tell there's a screen protector or just screen,5
8836,so to sum it up i am very happy with this seller and would order from them again,5
8837,the stock battery just never has enough juice to get me through the day with heavy use of gps and steaming music,5
8838,i first bought this for use with my ipod touch as explained above,5
8839,there is no screen cover but i was so happy with this case i ordered a second one for another ipod,5
8840,the texture of the rest of the case is exactly what i ordered and looks great on my new phone,5
8841,i've been using it for a year and a half and i'm still using,5
8842,there are other cases that do both simultaneously which i think would be a little more accurate although the finish is very clean,5
8843,i've used the rubber screen protectors in the past but this one is the best value,5
8844,just wanted to say that i received this product as a free sample to be reviewed,5
8845,yes you have to take your phone out of the case and it is very protective covering the front home button and surrounding area,5
8846,by far my favorite thin case i have bought for my iphone since i got it,5
8847,never but for a set with mic which i can plug in and make sure i don't end up dead,5
8848,the plastic is slightly textured to help with grip but it is definitely a plastic case,5
8849,i really like the fact that i can charge my phone and tablet at the same time though the charging time may vary,5
8850,he still has a hard plastic cover for the front of the phone is glossy,5
8851,the only thing i don 8217 t like about this charger is that the charging cable comes with inter-changeable heads,5
8852,i also have the otterbox commuterotterbox defender series case for iphone 5 retail packaging black but slightly more light-weight,5
8853,but i have a dry bag for that when my phone is in the dock it looks like part of the car,5
8854,this was after i trashed the protector that came with my otter box and it i did not like,5
8855,it seems well built and for the price was a great deal,5
8856,i saw this powerbolt duo and i like the fact that the back plate is detachable from the rubber inner layer,5
8857,but i will play with the settings to see if i can get a better seal to block extraneous noise,5
8858,all of these sounded amazing considering the size of this thing it is tiny,5
8859,after shelling out so much on the phone i didn't have much to lose by giving them a shot,5
8860,why i ordered the battery i am a heavy user of the phone during the day,5
8861,this is probably the best case i have ever bought for this low of a price,5
8862,these bluetooth earbuds completely solve this problem because now i don't have my phone on me anyway,5
8863,no more worrying of scratching the camera lens when you put it on the phone around the rubber sleeve it feels very firm,5
8864,the main features and specifications were written on the back of the protector will do the trick,5
8865,it's super cute and at first i didn't know what to expect with the new trent arcadia pens,5
8866,perfect for travel hiking and day-to-day use it's a great option,5
8867,i've been using this cord for a long time now and still no issues,5
8868,the connector fits perfectly in my galaxy s2 epic 4 g touch and this case fits perfectly,5
8869,the instruction guide was helpful however i really don't think you can beat this case for the price,5
8870,haven't had any scratching issues yet but i've only had it about a week but so far it's been great,5
8871,though the blueant does come with a usb cable that will allow you to charge devices that utilize a micro usb,5
8872,i did have one situation where i dropped the phone and it was kicked across a parking lot,5
8873,my thunderbolt is not damaged at all on the best part is that the case even covers the volume rocker and power button,5
8874,if you have any questions i'll try my best to send you my needs whenever i can,5
8875,i use my ipad for my job and i love that it's bright blue so it's hard to lose,5
8876,some fit snugly and others not and feel like they are going to rip apart as you drag them across the screen,5
8877,you can also say ignore if you don't want to pay more get this one,5
8878,just place it around you neck and you don't have to see them to push them,5
8879,i think the only thing i'm not crazy about and it doesn't take away from my ipohne 5c's green color backing,5
8880,fits very well and the power and volume buttons are a bit hard to push but you get used to it,5
8881,you have 4 blue lights to indicate how much charge the battery has left,5
8882,or forget to plug them in at night and then have to get up to get a pen to write something down,5
8883,peeled away the top sheet you can't even tell there is a screen protector on there at all,5
8884,fits car outlet perfect and i like it has an extra usb port for a second gadget to charge,5
8885,after multiple drops and harsh treatment the case still looks like new and my phone has been flawlessly protected,5
8886,i ordered this for my wife and she loves it also,5
8887,problem 1 she doesn't get a good grip on the case but then it slides right off,5
8888,gps drains your battery profusely but again you don't have to worry too much about sand and rocks scratching delicate plastic,5
8889,i highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a stylish modern looking bumper case,5
8890,this product actually had me worried i wasnt sure if it was going to make my phone look bigger and ulky,5
8891,before bying zagg for my nexus at first i was hesitant to buy this at first because of the price,5
8892,got sick of how bulky it was and am very happy with this product and will probably buy additional units to scatter throughout the house,5
8893,i'm very happy with the case and would recommend to family and friends,5
8894,dry apply screen protectors are garbage don't waste your time with other holders this one is great,5
8895,it works like a charm to charge up my iphone ipad as well as nexus 7,5
8896,maxboost samsung galaxy s5 case shell holster combo protective case for samsung galaxy note 3 again i am 100 % happy buyer,5
8897,i have made many anker purchases and i have yet to be disappointed by any i've gotten from new trent,5
8898,he loves to play with my phone and this case has protected it beautifully,5
8899,granted there is not heavy use but the phone has been on for 6 hours and is still at full charge,5
8900,it is exactly as described and it does exactly what it's supposed to do and does look sharp in black and neon green,5
8901,if you want something that can easily fit in a pocket or purse and yet still easy to find,5
8902,the great thing about this is that i it doesn't have a button where you have to put it in pairing mode,5
8903,i would highly recommend the case for those who don't want their music jailed by the like of itunes,5
8904,the sound quality is superb most people don't even know i have them on since my hair covers them completely,5
8905,bluetooth was a little tricky as it was my first time to do it since it is my husband who does this things,5
8906,so she uses it all the time and it is still in great shape,5
8907,it a snap on case that fits the iphone 5 perfectly and is not loose,5
8908,overnight charging is best since it does take some time to charge but nevertheless it is very useful,5
8909,its not that thin filimsy cable i would recommend this product to everyone who is looking for a simple but cute case,5
8910,i bought these cable adapters to charge my iphone 5 without having to remove it from the case in order to use the docking station,5
8911,the face that it comes with 2 batteries and an external charger plus the stock battery is perfect for me,5
8912,if you are looking for a screen protector that was easy to put on and looks nice,5
8913,it has 2 ports for any usb cord so i don't need to take a wallet and my phone,5
8914,our cell phones charge this way and it comes in handy when you need more battery life and don't have a charger,5
8915,good quality and seems very sturdy and feels like it would protect my ipod if i dropped it,5
8916,all the cut outs are perfect and do not interfere with the touch screen at all,5
8917,i have a very faint scratch on the upper left corner of the inside layer on the protector,5
8918,i purchased a set over a year ago and they are still going strong,5
8919,i love this case so much that i have four of them in red royal blue hot pink and black,5
8920,too scared to try my keys so i don't think i need an extreme heavy duty case,5
8921,because theinput's micro usb is the same size as my 5 inch google nexus phone,5
8922,order several because of the price you can change them to match whatever i'm wearing i have had many compliments on it,5
8923,not a scratch or scuff and i've had this for a few days but so far it is amazing,5
8924,i am pleased with it though there are some things i would like to see improved camera low-light performance is horrible,5
8925,i've not been a fan of skinomi but i took a chance on these and they did not disappoint,5
8926,the two major downsides being having to take the case apart to confirm the back is plastic and not aluminum,5
8927,i'm 15 years old and i bought this hello kitty case for my daughter 34s iphone,5
8928,the moshi is much less particular about the installation i was able to get a completely dust and fingerprint-free installation,5
8929,they last just as long as the original battery as far as i can tell it charges everything at full speed,5
8930,another plus with this case is that it's not bulky,5
8931,this screen protector protects the heck out of it and it's really sturdy,5
8932,two 34 new 34 ipads 3rd gen an iphone 5 and a galaxy s4-small for its very high output of 3,5
8933,basically you plug in the supplied cable into one of the usb ports to act as an antenna,5
8934,it makes it easy to get in and out of my jeans pocket easily but is still easy to grip,5
8935,comes in two parts so i'm certain that if i dropped my phone this screen protector would keep my screen from breaking,5
8936,easy to apply and make it easier to see in a dimly lit car,5
8937,i haven't dropped it yet so don't know if it slows charging doing both or not,5
8938,the case it self is red but i don't use it everyday because it might get dirty,5
8939,i like this speaker it charges quickly was easy to pair with our phones and pairing was quick and trouble-free,5
8940,but if they do i'll be sure to update my note regarding it,5
8941,i'm a painter and i was looking for something similar but cheaper than an otterbox,5
8942,another issue to be aware of is that the case will not protect the iphone as well as look good,5
8943,i would recommend this battery to anyone looking for an extra charger for their phone,5
8944,this arrived with a a usb cable so you can plug it in and always know where your stylus is,5
8945,applied it's exactly the same as the original that comes with the phone when you first but it,5
8946,and i am sure that the more you take it in and out of its case and it still holds up nicely,5
8947,i am glad that i don't have to carry around extra cables,5
8948,i use it to connect both my iphone 5s and my wife's iphone 5c,5
8949,the speck products candyshell grip case for iphone 5 black slate greythat i purchased with the phone,5
8950,if you are holding it it's not a problem but just to make things clear,5
8951,this unit is guaranteed to not over-heat over-current or over-charge your device,5
8952,having purchased it and using it for about 3 weeks and i really like the look color,5
8953,i like that it's matte not glossy and has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold it,5
8954,this headset is so clear that i can't tell if he's using it or not when he calls,5
8955,first let me state that anker provided me with a sample of this devise to try but did not request a review,5
8956,i received the case very quickly and it fits my samsung note 3 along with another case perfectly,5
8957,it's fantastic it looks great feels great and does not add any bulk at all to the phone while keeping very classy styling,5
8958,im going to buy one for my wife as well,5
8959,it is also one of the best screen protector for iphone 5 ever,5
8960,well this anti-glare screen protector is better than the ones you have to plug in separately,5
8961,i've dropped a few times with no damage to the cell phone or the defender,5
8962,surprisingly the v2 case works perfectly with my phone and leaves just enough room around the edge for my case,5
8963,in my prior cars with integrated bluetooth i got a lot of complaints about talking on my phone without it,5
8964,it's not slippery it's resistant to smudges and finger prints and protects your device better,5
8965,there's not much i can say about a charger other than it does the job it is sold to do,5
8966,if you are a fan of the matte finish screen protectors so they replaced them with the crystal clear protectors,5
8967,so far i like these the material is much better and it doesn't bother the screen performance,5
8968,i purchased this product to use in conjunction with my kindle fire hd and my mp3 player when i'm away from home,5
8969,after looking at various options and reading various reviews i decided to take the plunge and i couldn't be more happy with this device,5
8970,received the case in a timely manner for my galaxy s4 and it was the first and last case that i had,5
8971,it fits perfectly and is not difficult to remove the phone from my pocket to answer it,5
8972,i bought this for my new z10 and i'm very happy with the purchase of this item,5
8973,best of all it does not come with a cover for the front of the phone is glossy,5
8974,for him having an extra battery pack on the go as well as reduces the cable clutter in your bag,5
8975,click the silver button twice to power it on and off to make sure the unit is at full capacity,5
8976,i have had this case for about 2 months now and haven't had to replace it,5
8977,i also tried them on my iphone and ipad and i've been very happy without cases or protectors,5
8978,they back it with a 1 year warranty if you have a problem with it the company will stand behind their product,5
8979,the only thing i didn't like is that when i put it a holster it starts getting hot,5
8980,i would say the one and only drawback to this case is that it is not flushed with the phone in the front,5
8981,the package comes with three but i have had the same button on for a couple months,5
8982,i've had mine for almost a year now and couldn't be happier with it,5
8983,we took it to the beach and fell in love with it looks the same as the picture,5
8984,the case itself provides real protection with just the right amount of base without any tininess at all,5
8985,i'd highly recommend this battery if you're looking for an iphone 4 slim case then stop looking,5
8986,if you use the phone while it's in the case,5
8987,it will charge the phone and allow you to use it either as a magnetic mount or a clip-type mount,5
8988,a full charge will do just about one and a half full charges more or less depending on usage,5
8989,this is all fine as long as that is what you are looking for then this belkin grip is definitely for you,5
8990,this will last as long as the one that came with the stylus excellent quality materials perfect fitting,5
8991,what i didn't like was that when it is plugged in to show it is getting power,5
8992,bought one and loved it and gave it to a friend in need and i registered it a month later,5
8993,i bought the product a month ago and it works just as well as the one that came with the phone,5
8994,this just confirms that this headset is still one of the best price for this out there,5
8995,i have purchased stylus in the past and they have never let me down,5
8996,i have experienced no issues even with 3 iphones and an ipad we needed an additional charger,5
8997,power button and volume button are sensitive just like the original buttons on the phone which are recessed at that point,5
8998,the only thig i don't really like about this case is that it is such a thick case,5
8999,it's so nice that you don't have to worry about another charger or cable or anything,5
9000,i've used this battery for about a month and it has been great so far for all my long and short trip,5
9001,if your car does not have this input this won't work for you but for regular use should do the job,5
9002,most importantly the product is easy to use and apply all functions work well,5
9003,the ear speaker is loud even to the point that i don't even notice them and once you have them on they stay put,5
9004,i looked at the other cases and i also believe that this is the best case i've found for my iphone 4s,5
9005,the silicone sleeve comes around over the edge of the screen so they really do not look out of place,5
9006,i work in a profession where i am constantly getting in and out of my little car was too much for it,5
9007,this is a winner hands down i highly recommend this item for as a miniature but enjoyable quality portable sound system,5
9008,fit perfect phone looks fresh and this cover doesn't take away from the slim look and feel of the phone which i like,5
9009,it's slim and grippy in all the right places and easy to find buttons,5
9010,caps lock for emphasis not yelling all in all this case is perfect and a lovely color,5
9011,disclaimer i received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the tt-br01 bluetooth dongle,5
9012,overall this charger is a no-brainer if you need a spare battery for backup i highly recommend the samsung brand,5
9013,once it's installed it's stays put and i'm confident that it won't fall apart like some do,5
9014,the legs are there just to prevent the phone from falling off the charger,5
9015,i am soooo glad i went ahead and bought it and it works great for my iphone 4 and the top broke,5
9016,you can also press the button to turn on the device is keep that,5
9017,i was a little worried about whether or not it would fit the phone due to the new thickness of the phone,5
9018,the led light is enabled and disabled by pressing the power button twice and turn off by doing the same,5
9019,the ear speaker is loud even to the point that i don't even notice a difference in the color,5
9020,i thought the crystals would fall off immediately but i am happy to say after a few months of use,5
9021,i was blown away by this phone and i can't wait to see how they perform in real world use this weekend,5
9022,this is a short cable with a usb connector on one end and a micro-usb on the other,5
9023,it will take some getting used to but i've gotten a lot of compliments on it,5
9024,i've had several diztronic tpu cases iphone 4 galaxy nexus and now this one for htc one,5
9025,overall a great solution for the problem of not being able to charge my macbook pro which now boasts longer battery life,5
9026,this battery has turned out to be a really pretty case,5
9027,i had been looking for a while for a extended battery for my note 2 and this charges it with no issues,5
9028,important note you have to remove the case to charge wordlessly,5
9029,this one adds only 1 4 oz to my iphone 5s and provides a full charge in about 2 hours,5
9030,6 mm warranty 1 yeari was supplied a sample for the purpose of review and evaluation and promised an unbiased review,5
9031,i have been trying to find a case that looks good on the phone and feels good in the hand,5
9032,in short she loves it and i have placed an order for the lace and pearl hand case cover,5
9033,to activate the battery press the button on the top face where the iflash logo is,5
9034,it does add quite a bit of bulk and weight to the phone but that doesn't bother me as much,5
9035,the battery was a perfect fit for my galaxy s3 i9300,5
9036,it's not a deal breaker because i didn't get it for the actual headset it's made for,5
9037,i have used it on both my iphone 5 and ipad mini simultaneously no problems to report,5
9038,overall i think this is a great phone especially for those who are not ready for galaxy s3 or 4 yet,5
9039,the lip around the front of the phone that covers the edges of the phone the entire back and camera lens is exposed,5
9040,this was a god send i'm so glad i purchased this one instead of the cup one,5
9041,fits well considering the curved edges on the note it is very clear and doesn't detract from the viewing experience at all,5
9042,its got just enough material covering around the edge of the glass for protection of the screen,5
9043,i ordered this case because i have a ballistic case for my phone and it happened to be this one,5
9044,first thing i noticed was the packaging and the fit and finish of the case and cover is near perfect,5
9045,it does add a little bit of bulk but overall great,5
9046,bottom line this battery pack means that i will not have to carry a mirror with me is appealing,5
9047,i have had this for a couple of months and is still going strong,5
9048,it will not fit the usb cable that came with the phone i keep it home,5
9049,the color is a little darker than the picture but it's a nice blue color,5
9050,this is a genuine samsung product identical to the one i got with my phone except this one has two ports,5
9051,while multi-port chargers are easily found this is the first one i used with my current razr 4 g phone,5
9052,after reading some of the reviews i was hesitant but i figured i would give it a try,5
9053,is battery cover fits really good its just like the original one that i ordered a couple years ago from jawbone,5
9054,i have been using this for over a year now and am constantly impressed by it,5
9055,first off the design-it's around the size of a phone with around twice the thickness,5
9056,i know i will get a lot of use out of this on the golf course last year,5
9057,i havent taken the case off yet to see if it is the top or bottom slow for the higher charging voltage,5
9058,when the iphone 5 came out so i took a chance on these and they did not disappoint,5
9059,there is a built in plastic screen protector so you do not need to remove it regularly,5
9060,he told me today that he dropped his phone and the case protected it from water damage,5
9061,all of the buttons are still easily accessible with the case and it does not bother me one bit,5
9062,the cutouts are perfectly placed and all buttons and ports are easily accessible including the ringer silence switch,5
9063,would buy another once they make one for the iphone without the grey interior,5
9064,9830 it has a rechargeable battery that charges with a standard micro usb cable one is provided with this battery,5
9065,always love to protect what i purchase and this is a great way to add usb charging to your car,5
9066,charges 2 devices at once and is compact enough to fit into a purse or pocket,5
9067,this power bank supersedes my needs i received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review,5
9068,the case has taken a beating a few times but that is to be expected since this product was made mainly for apple products,5
9069,it is thin but yet still protects my phone on the sides with it's padded spring release sides is great,5
9070,i'm trying out different plugs for my phone and this is one of my favorite cell phone cases ever i have a ton,5
9071,to start off these are one of the best cases on the market,5
9072,i have dropped my phone a few times and was happy to see the skip play and pause buttons all worked perfectly,5
9073,i purchased a set over a year ago and they are still going strong,5
9074,i have been using it now for about 3 months and it's still going strong with no key problems or any other problems,5
9075,it is so much better than the stock battery that came with the galaxy s3-wall charger works great to charge the battery with,5
9076,i'm glad i will now have something that will protect my phone from drops or anything that i can throw at it,5
9077,the phone is nice but it does not come with a screen protector so make sure you get purchase one when you order,5
9078,the case fits perfectly looks great and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone,5
9079,so i guess that means i need to purchase another one for the back seat people and then i'm set,5
9080,with this battery you know exactly how much power is left via a percentage,5
9081,this is a perfect replacement battery for my samsung galaxy vibrant from tmobile to leave at work,5
9082,the headset itself sounds excellent and i couldn't believe the price 9 colored styluses for only 10,5
9083,however it is so clear that it is hard to tell that the phone has a case on,5
9084,it is difficult to slide the phone in and out of the holder very easily but stillfeels secure,5
9085,they last about 6 months and it's still like new,5
9086,i'm quite happy with the case and would highly recommend it to anyone who has a tablet or smartphone,5
9087,the small rim at the front of the case is just minimal enough to protect the screen if the phone lands face down,5
9088,overall i gave the unit 5 stars for ease of use simplicity and being a must have,5
9089,techmatte advise you to use their method of installing a screen protector but you can buy these on amazon for a buck or two,5
9090,although when you want to change cases make sure you don't want to use bluetooth and just need the speaker part,5
9091,so when i ordered this for my iphone 5 and raelly love it,5
9092,you're not going to find a better case for the money,5
9093,i enjoyed the look and feel of the phone in the case is my only slight complaint,5
9094,slim sleek and doesn't take away from the beauty of the iphone 5,5
9095,when its plugged in it takes up very little room for a 3-port charger,5
9096,i change batteries once or twice a day but it doesn't really bother me so i'm leaving it,5
9097,i have used several in the past and this one is just as good performance-wise,5
9098,i put it on my windshield over a year ago and it has not come off in the few weeks since i put it there,5
9099,i love how the controls are easy to access and the case phone fits easily in my pocket,5
9100,it's quite thin but due to the fact that the galaxy s3 uses the new pin configuration,5
9101,you go to best buy to get a new battery and found this one at a decent price,5
9102,the note ii is not a phone and it's not a small phone to begin with,5
9103,hello i bought this as a gift for my brother and he loved it,5
9104,comes with everything you need just be careful when taking the phone out of your pocket,5
9105,sometimes when i am at home i do not want to be accused of being rude or talking to my self,5
9106,it is very durable and easy to use as well as the camera,5
9107,it will take about 2 1 2 hours to charge the rest of the way through 100 percent what is a good battery,5
9108,it charges my iphone 5 faster than the charger that comes with it charges the oem too,5
9109,i wish it came with its own adapter but that's not a huge deal considering how perfect the case is otherwise,5
9110,the second way this function works is that the button on the upper right of the lcd,5
9111,i have one scratch its a mystery how it got there but i was easily able to use a damp cloth to clean,5
9112,this is a great protector case and works very well with my iphone and now my iphone is safe,5
9113,fits very snug easily accessible light weight comes in a variety of colors and has high quality sound for being so small,5
9114,this little case is by far the best i've seen,5
9115,if i put this on my phone i was really impressed with the clarity of the signal through the car speakers,5
9116,there isn't much to say about this product other than it works exactly as advertised,5
9117,i love this case i haven't used it on belt but in purse,5
9118,does a good job the case has a slight lip and the phone can be placed face-down,5
9119,this case fit the phone perfectly without adding too much bulk to a perfectly sized device,5
9120,3 the bright color makes it easy to spot in my luggage,5
9121,i've been using mine for about a week and i couldn't be happier considering the price and value,5
9122,it arrived fast and i am very happy with it and i will use it quite a bit,5
9123,the magnet is very secure but it is easy to get the device out also,5
9124,i have an otterbox commuter case on my phone which i do not have to take off the case,5
9125,i think i would have been happy with the bose but for half the price and they also make good quality cases,5
9126,first off the ear clip does what it's supposed to do and that its results can be trusted,5
9127,the beast10 000 mah mean that you can charge your phone and the extra battery at the same time,5
9128,constuct is well made and love how well it holds the phone in place wonderfully and it doesn't fall off,5
9129,these offer some grip and protection of the screen when laying the phone flat on a surface and type with the index fingers,5
9130,i used my phone after working out at the gym and spending a lazy afternoon at a cafe,5
9131,installation was not a problem just take your time and follow the directions giving yourself plenty of space,5
9132,i have been using these for a few days now and they are all easy to take off and put back on,5
9133,the led remains lit all the time whether or not it 8217s charging,5
9134,i now have two of these and would not hesitate to buy it if i need one,5
9135,i've only had it for about a week and it works flawlessly,5
9136,i bought this because the first case i bought for my galaxy phone and the third time was a charm,5
9137,this replacement battery is the same as the original apple adapter that comes with the iphone 5 is not long enough for the car,5
9138,this cord works like a charm i have been using it constantly for the past several weeks,5
9139,it's really high quality easy to install and remove and stays in place very well,5
9140,the charger is very sturdy sleek looking and is the right size for my phone perhaps a bit too wide,5
9141,i absolutely love this case it doesn't make the phone 2x bigger,5
9142,i normally don 8217 t buy cases since i treat my phone like a piece of brick and it looks beautiful so far,5
9143,so all and all-i think this was a good purchase and am happy with the price,5
9144,mind you it's not an otterbox so don't expect it to be darker lighter,5
9145,the cheap wally world receive adapter is very similar in size and weight of the standard htc thbt,5
9146,the included battery is samsung original equipment appears to be identical to the charger that was bundled with my motorola droid x,5
9147,but the only downside is if you use a standard micro-usb cable and plugs up into any usb port,5
9148,no more having to get an extension so it is long enough to reach from the outlet to a bedside table,5
9149,it simply is the best i've used and it's very easy to wife clean,5
9150,it's very durable and takes care of the phone very well and is very easy to use,5
9151,my husband can't tell that i'm on a headset,5
9152,the color is great and i feel like it will protect the phone in case it is dropped,5
9153,it's great to be able to put the phone on a table and i'm swyping away a message,5
9154,it gives my phone maximum protection with out being bulky like some other cases i have had,5
9155,the glossy texture is nice if you keep the phone in your pocket without adding a lot of bulk with a full case,5
9156,i purchased two of these and they both work fine with my ipad iphone and ipod,5
9157,fits like a glove and does not add any bulk to the phone but protects the sides and edges,5
9158,they seem to work just as well as the stock battery that came with my s4,5
9159,the plastic thats provided really helped him get rid of the bubbles and make the screen cover stick the first application,5
9160,very reliable battery and works just as good as the one i had paid much more money,5
9161,i got it today i will be sure to update this review until then you can assume it's working fine,5
9162,i gave it to my daughter as she tends to use the phone as a navigation device and still charges the battery,5
9163,overall this is a great thin case to protect your phone from drops scratches and from having a broken screen,5
9164,i got his case for my hubby new phone because the one that came with the phone and is obviously an oem product,5
9165,these screen protectors were very easy to apply and came with cover for the back of the phone to be shown through the tpu,5
9166,it is really lovely it is very pretty and i look forward to buying all of my s4 accessories from spigen,5
9167,i suggest it for anyone looking for something of this sort,5
9168,this product is great it arrived on time and it is a very nice piece of equipment,5
9169,i recommend this to people who need to charge a tablet and a phone at the same time and evenly,5
9170,this is a great case that does not add very much bulk to the phone at all yet it feels well protected,5
9171,i love not worrying so much if i dropped my phone in the case in the lake by accident,5
9172,on the white it is very hard to get the case on and off but that is expected by a protective case,5
9173,but being able to charge it in the car using the standard usb connection,5
9174,i never have to worry about the screen getting scratched on the table,5
9175,on top of it all the skinomi is half the price of the lifeproof and offers the same quality and protection,5
9176,this case got to me in just a couple of days and i have used so many cases its unreal,5
9177,i got this phone case in the mail today and it came early which is good and i would recommend this case to everybody,5
9178,easily my most favorite smartphone i have ever owned and i've owned several different brands,5
9179,it is exactly as described and it does exactly what it should and feels like a quality product,5
9180,now i have accident insurance on my phone but that is hardly the fault of this mount,5
9181,this case provides a rim along the screen to protect it when if it falls on the screen side,5
9182,both apple android since its 14000mah i do not have to keep track of the adapter for my 2,5
9183,th case is great for galaxy s4 i liked it so much i bought another for my wife,5
9184,i was blown away by this phone and i can't wait to use it for overseas flights with the family,5
9185,if the juice box is fully discharged it takes about 7-8 hours to charge as stated in the specifications,5
9186,my original battery was good for about 5-6 hours but moving around a lot,5
9187,great case for the price and the protection it provides for the screen is worth it,5
9188,this is a really nice case i love the stand on the back of this case which i was originally worried about,5
9189,the case fits my galaxy s4 well and all of the ports are positioned perfectly and work well,5
9190,i tested it without any problems on google nexus 5 smartphone ipad air iphone 4gswhat 8217s good about it,5
9191,that's all there is to it it beeps to let me know its charging but not brightenough to keep me awake,5
9192,i boughtanother case just to have a case on the phone i couldn't use the product,5
9193,the hp touchpad 4 g had no battery charge when i plugged it into the wall using the nt90c usb to wall ac dual adapter,5
9194,also love that i can use my phone for at least a day and a half of charge before dying,5
9195,i had this case on my iphone 4s for about a year now and haven't noticed any scratches at all,5
9196,it fits and makes it so i can use my phone as i lay in bed,5
9197,i would recommend this to anyone who has to deal with a lot of t-mobile bloatware,5
9198,the backbeat 903 are so comfortable and the band that goes around the back of my ear was a bit much,5
9199,i bought this cover for my daughter to protect her smartphone from drop damages,5
9200,i bought one for my note 2 blue and one for my wife's car as she does not have bluetooth,5
9201,i don't want to end up with a cracked screen and 100 for a phone insurance deductible,5
9202,so when it came time to get a new one for myself and bought this second generation astro,5
9203,i tend to be very hard on your phone i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good solid usb car charger,5
9204,this nixessories tablet stand works well for both my ipad and my iphone simultaneously the ipad goes in the 2,5
9205,which is great when i need to charge my external battery,5
9206,you can use it anywhere so it's almost a must-have for traveling with multiple usb-charging devices,5
9207,the battery charges fast and it charges my iphone 4s and my daughter's 4 generation ipod touch,5
9208,the sound quality is great and the battery life is fantastic,5
9209,the belt clip also acts as a second stand while the phone is in the carry case but not for the power cord,5
9210,the one thing i don't like is that when i put it in my bag or pocket,5
9211,if there are any issues down the line i'll be sure to update this review,5
9212,the charger case is compact enough to carry around in my jeans pocket even the tight ones,5
9213,the battery looks and feels like the original battery that came with my fone and works well,5
9214,this is common in my vacations and i was very pleased with the lookand feel of it,5
9215,refrain from touching the sticky side of the screen protector and your hands as well to avoid fingerprints,5
9216,i need a case for work so i don't have to keep it plugged in for longer use,5
9217,i've been using this for over a year and it wears well,5
9218,easy to use easy to install very good quality and for the price you can't beat it,5
9219,works just as well as the one that came with the samsung note phone i just bought,5
9220,i have tried many cases but this one is the only one that fits,5
9221,that's all i have and once again i'm very pleased with the belkin grip sheer case and highly recommend it,5
9222,i like knowing that i am going to get another one with different color,5
9223,i love my new phone case so much that i ordered the same pattern in a couple of other colors,5
9224,works as advertised and obviously the highlight is being able to charge two power hungry devices at the same time,5
9225,i would only leave it in the sleeve when you want to use it as an alarm clock an ambient sound machine and charger,5
9226,worth the money and i had this screen protector for a couple weeks now and i must say im quite impressed with its longevity,5
9227,this case is perfect for people who are on the road a lot,5
9228,the people i called could not tell that i was pressing the mute button,5
9229,i was worried it would be too bulky but it's really not bad,5
9230,after two months of use i can make it through the day without charging our phone,5
9231,there is nothing like the feeling of knowing your phone is well protected and it provides easy access to the charging access,5
9232,i have been using this external battery pack for several weeks now and i can not say enough about the anker team,5
9233,this cover fits well feels good and doesn't get stuck in your pockets and provides basic protection for the phone,5
9234,it also protects the front of the phone which gives it an additional layer of protection,5
9235,i was continually having to charge my phone took a chance and bought this after seeing how easy the repair was,5
9236,i love the fact that you can still slide the phone in and out of the case and feel pretty protected,5
9237,you just place the phone near the mount and it magically snaps in place,5
9238,the installation is a little tricky but if you take your time it's not hard at all,5
9239,a few bubbles did get under the protector but i was able to smooth it out so it looked perfect,5
9240,plus the sides are rounded and you don't have to worry about getting my phone wet,5
9241,they fit and i am happy with the purchase and would recommend not only the accessory but also the seller,5
9242,it works at distance although i haven't tried it yet to test it but when i do i'll update,5
9243,i have no interests financial or otherwise in the manufacturer its employees or suppliers,5
9244,i've tried it if you're looking for a screen protector for your iphone 5 5s and 5c,5
9245,the sound quality is as good as using the bare glass and it has a great feel and looks awesome too,5
9246,it has been like a month and i'm still on my first screen protector for 3 months now,5
9247,i was so upset til i found this one on amazon for cheaper in a sealed package,5
9248,i ordered the clear case and it really shows off the sleek look of the iphone 4 and preened diligently through amazon,5
9249,i have not tried them as headset for my phone because i don't any bloatware from t-mobile or att etc,5
9250,my phone has fell a number of times and the phone is still in perfect condition even after being dropped from waist level onto concrete,5
9251,shipping was fast and the product is thicker than i thought it would be it measures 4 x 2 and almost 3 4 thick,5
9252,the inner piece is plastic and it comes in two pieces that you put on your phone but its on the actual case,5
9253,i am an avid outdoors person so this guy has been put to the test for a while now and is not worn out,5
9254,i love the product but it doesn't work for me but my wife sure isn't,5
9255,it is just a personal preference as to the look of the case and am very glad our iphone is protected so well,5
9256,it even works with my ti-nspire cx cas graphing calculator pretty fast,5
9257,i needed some cables and travel chargers and this was a great deal on the mirror screen protectors,5
9258,i've had it for about 2 months now and it still seems to work great,5
9259,i read that it was durable and felt comfortable and that's exactly what i want and what i can never find,5
9260,since the battery size is pretty large i just let it charge over night and know exactly where i left it in the car ha,5
9261,i would recommend this product whole heartedly to others who are looking for an excellent case at a decent cost,5
9262,after cleaning the screen peel the plastic off the back of the case and serve as resting points,5
9263,i have been using skinomi screen protectors for a long time and i haven't been exactly easy on it,5
9264,it's fairly heavy so i'd not recommend carrying it in your pocket all day long unless you have the space,5
9265,other headsets of lower quality seem to be able to handle the size and weight of my large smartphone,5
9266,i like knowing that i am going to get another one with different color,5
9267,on this one it is a flaw unless you don't want to use bluetooth to stream audio to your stereo,5
9268,i have not tried plantronic's vocalyst yet so i dont know how durable they are but right now the are amazing,5
9269,the grip on the case prevents the blackberry from slipping out of your hand and keeps it from getting all scratched up,5
9270,skinomi is better than most and i don't see it coming off without my provocation,5
9271,protects your phone and you are still able to use your phone while the device is charging it,5
9272,it's super durable i've dropped it numerous times and it doesn't appear to be short of a full charge at all,5
9273,i purchased this product because the original one that came with the phone and much faster than the previously mentioned verizon charger,5
9274,they're good for that plus the material can be used to clean the battery pack or your ipad or other device screen,5
9275,this cover is thin and adds very little size to my note 3,5
9276,i even wear them when i go grocery shopping so i don't have to worry about tumbles to the ground,5
9277,only now my son has inherited my nexus 4 and this case is by far my favorite so far,5
9278,the phone case arrived a few days earlier than expected and hurried and applied,5
9279,i've been using simple mobile for about 4 years now and this curved screen protector lives up to my expectations,5
9280,i love this case and holster i have had this case now for a few months and it works fine charging my ipod touch 4,5
9281,i found myself examining the design closely and i was blown away by all the 5 star ratings,5
9282,the screen protectors are really easy to install and didnt had any bubbles coming up,5
9283,i have tried many bluetooth headsets and this one is my favorite by a wide margin,5
9284,i've also bought a battery charger that plugs into the wall it charges much faster this way than anything else,5
9285,i've only used this for a couple of weeks i am very impressed,5
9286,it did take a little while to come but it was worth it,5
9287,pairing is easy simply press and hold the power button to turn the flashlight on off,5
9288,well he picked up a 3 pack of these and put it on my phone right away and i love it,5
9289,and finally these are high quality and very well made because it stays on,5
9290,have had many otterbox's over the years and this one appears much smaller and more light weight,5
9291,my only suggestion is that you may want to invest in a zagg invisishield product or the like,5
9292,this replacement charger works well and it's very hard to tell the difference between to the two,5
9293,it adds a small lip to the screen side which will protect the screen from scratches but it will eventually become scratched,5
9294,it's very durable and i've not had any issues with disconnection or long term access,5
9295,i also find the need toconnect to blutooth speakers and i never had to worry abt finding an outlet at an airport,5
9296,i did not use it for a few months and it still looks brand new,5
9297,i have used it in class for about a week now and i'm very happy with it,5
9298,i like so many reviewers before me received a sample of this product in order to review it and give my honest opinion feedback,5
9299,the only improvements i could think of for this product would be to not make the fit so tight,5
9300,i find with most cases this switch can be a pain to get off but hard enough where your phone is protected,5
9301,i bought the otterbox case for my s3 and it was my favorite case,5
9302,it has enough of a lip around the front so i can lay the phone face down w o worry,5
9303,these screen protectors are better than the one that came with my captivate,5
9304,it does shake a bit during driving but that is to be expected since this product was made mainly for apple products,5
9305,wish the phone were more efficient but it is good enough for most jobs and great to have on hand,5
9306,i made the change because i wanted a2dp so i can listen to my music on the way home and to work,5
9307,i'm disappointed on this case i've had a couple of other stand they just didn't cut it,5
9308,especially when the price is way cheaper than the original cable and you can hardly tell the difference,5
9309,seems well built and it has protected my phone well through several drops,5
9310,i bought this case for my sister as a christmas gift and she absolutely loves it,5
9311,the unit is very small and light about the size of a typical deck of cards and weighs about twice as much,5
9312,this is a nice case and giving it 5 stars because it does what it's suppose too,5
9313,i've been using the phone on and off all day and still only has to charge it every other day with only moderate use,5
9314,he liked it so much i had to order some more,5
9315,wish this phone came with a better camera but as long as it has the charge rating you require for your device,5
9316,i think i could probably get two full days of heavy use and it never gives up,5
9317,not obnoxious and adds a little bit of grip so it doesnt slide out of pocket by its self,5
9318,i really like flip cases and this case is perfect for protection and showing off my skin,5
9319,would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a simple case to solve samsung's slippery plastic phone problem,5
9320,it's a perfect fit on my samsung galaxy note 2 and 3 models unlocked world phone,5
9321,and it recharges my phone three times before needing a recharge itself this is the charger for you,5
9322,also because they're so thin there's no need to use a separate one to prevent scratches,5
9323,disclosure the supplier provided this product to me at no cost for the purposes of review,5
9324,i have many cases including otter boxes for my s3 and this is my second favorite first for the barely there cases,5
9325,i ordered this so i'd have a spare battery for my t-mobile note 3,5
9326,i was extremely happy and i can't wait to put my tablet in it,5
9327,it holds it much more securely and now i don't have to sit next to the outlet with my oem cord,5
9328,it does not take away the look of the phone and add too much weight size,5
9329,i've been looking for a protective case that wouldn't add too much bulk and feels like it will last,5
9330,i also like that when it is on it has a blue light that goes around the whole front of the charger,5
9331,my blackberry z10 and my kindle hdx were simultaneously fully charged from only 10 % within 90 minutes,5
9332,i have used 2 thus far and i have had no issues with this charger in outlets that others have trouble with,5
9333,overview worth every penny and if you want to see my unboxing review of this product on youtube,5
9334,the wall charger has both a 1 amp and a 2 amp for simultaneous charging of two devices,5
9335,but this card readers has a nice pigtail that makes it much easier to use since the outlets are not always that close by,5
9336,anker is a great product and i would buy it again,5
9337,this leather case is a great case for the galaxy4 with the otterbox case on it but that turns out to be false,5
9338,since the battery size is pretty large i just let it charge over night and know exactly where i left it in the car ha,5
9339,when i purchased them this was not a big deal to me just to have a holster,5
9340,it cleans easily if anything gets on it and doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone i think these are absolutely perfect,5
9341,if i do have a problem i'll update this review but so far this is an incredible deal given htc's price of 24,5
9342,this is a storage case that has a built in screen protector and comes with a good reputation,5
9343,definitely pick these up if you're looking for a screen protector for my motorola driod 2 global but had some critias,5
9344,i wanted a case that was not bulky and still be able to see it when an alert comes through,5
9345,the new trent nt90c dual usb port high-speed ac wall charger is great,5
9346,it's very portable and easy to take on the road if you have mixed devices and want to charge quickly,5
9347,he also comes with his own micro usb cable but you can use any usb charger you have,5
9348,this case is not as heavy or bulky as the defender series and i love the neon green that it comes in,5
9349,if you're in a crowd people are not going to be taking their phones swimming or driving over them with a car,5
9350,i simply love it definitely would recommend this to anyone wanting a case for everyday use,5
9351,impressions i've used this charger in my car for about two weeks and haven't needed to charge it again,5
9352,i had spent more money on so many cases for my iphone 5 but when i got it the phone didn't fit,5
9353,after trying 6 different windshield holders for my phone this is by far the best phone to hit the shelf this year,5
9354,this blue wonder just gets thrown into my diaper bag and i can charge my phone with the case on without any issues,5
9355,due to its large capacity the e4 is on the large side but as a desk charger it is not an issue,5
9356,the cheap wally world receive adapter is very similar in size and weight of the standard htc thbt,5
9357,have had the case for about a week now and so far the screen is holding up well,5
9358,battery life is at least as good as the oem battery that came with the phone,5
9359,i rarely give such a rating but this is one of those instances where you really get what you pay for,5
9360,the phone is actually easier to hold with this case on it and it retains a clean finger print free look,5
9361,i've used a lot of screen protectors over the years i always end up coming back to this case,5
9362,it has rubber grips where the clamp meets the phone so it won't be slip out of your hand,5
9363,it's so invincible that you can't even see there is a screen protector on the phone,5
9364,the stronger screen protector is genius and works just as well as the stock battery that came with my evo,5
9365,i need live in a very bad area so it's hard for me to read the tiny print on the present device,5
9366,it's as good as the battery that came with my phone neither of which are stellar,5
9367,i got this phone case after i dropped my phone a couple of times and the case has fully protected it,5
9368,keeping the speaker and mic off the back of the phone with the motherboard will be exposed,5
9369,the bottom portion of the case is a little larger than the original apple white charger and the android wall charger,5
9370,but since it's a simple usb interface it will charge anything that uses an usb connection and help simplify packing,5
9371,while you can use it alone in the future i am going to use it every day with my cigarette dual charger,5
9372,i have not used the battery backups yet but it's nice to know that you have made the connection,5
9373,its bright red theres a little light at the end would be such a game changer,5
9374,my first use of this product was last night and i am very impressed with the looks the fit and the functionality,5
9375,it is a soft rubbery type material which makes it easy to slip in and out of a pocket or purse,5
9376,it's well made and i love the credit card slots which is one of the reasons i purchased the skinomi,5
9377,the flashlight is nice when i don't want to take a purse i can use this phone case,5
9378,this is a perfect back up battery for your on-the-go and your phone or other small device needs a charge,5
9379,so bottom line is that i do like the product and have continued to use it,5
9380,those warranty's are a pain in the butt but this is about the best you can get that is not waterproof,5
9381,i dropped my case a few times with the case on and no damage occured to the case or phone,5
9382,i can charge up an iphone between 5-6 times before i have to recharge the battery,5
9383,i have a charger that does what it is supposed to do does it quickly and is inexpensive,5
9384,i read most of the reviews on here i have no doubt that it will last the lifetime of my phone,5
9385,provides good protection hoard outter shell make sit easy to pull in and out of pocket without feeling stuck like some other cases,5
9386,i've got many compliments on it and everyone asking where i got it from and i tould them,5

9388,i take this with me everywhere so i don't run out of juice half way through the day,5
9389,i use this car charger as a simple but effective way to apply the protector that is much easier than others,5
9390,it also has four blue led lights on the front of it to show how much charge is available,5
9391,i love it it looks great and it fits great on the samsung galaxy s3 would highly recommend it,5
9392,thanks why i order it and it came pretty fast about 3 days later,5
9393,it's small easy to use and holds my phone at just the right angle and height to be accessed while driving,5
9394,it looks just like in the picture it fits the phone perfectly and gives it a nice stylish look while also protecting it,5
9395,this spare battery allows me to cycle the original battery and this one is a little classier looking than the stock case,5
9396,spigen got it so right when they designed the slim armor case for iphone 5 will not add any noticeable size to your phone,5
9397,the design of the vent component is ingenious and it works well with my droid bionic with the case on it,5
9398,the price was great the item is great and i love the color and the feel of the case is light and silky,5
9399,i love the case the fact that it charges as well as the originals but your results may vary,5
9400,now that i've had it for a few months now with no issues,5
9401,i can not say long term battery as i have only had this for a week so these are initial impressions,5
9402,summary the 2014 sabrent 6 port charger to anyone looking for an easy to transport bluetooth portable speaker with great sound quality,5
9403,i've been using this mount for a few weeks now and have no complaints so far,5
9404,fits the phone very nicely and all the buttons work properly with it on,5
9405,the otter box also came with a screen protector but i purchased one separately,5

9408,i bought the nt630cr-b for my iphone 5s and i am very happy with it,5

9412,these arrived very quickly and i was able to apply the screen protector with no issues,5
9413,a plus is that the case came with a screen protector and all it had was air bubbles,5
9414,with cheaper units i always have to fiddle with it to get it to seat properly,5
9415,thin protective from scratches and has a lip on the front to prevent the phone from slipping,5
9416,another nicety is the color changing indicator to let you know roughly how much battery was left about 20 %,5
9417,she gets compliments on it all the time and it is way easier for him,5
9418,i have this case on my iphone 5s and have been using it for more than a year,5

9436,when they get dirty you can pull it off and reposition it as long as you don't drop it is great,5
9437,i like the color of it and the fact that you can see the metal frame on the iphone,5
9438,it doesn't add too much bulk to the phone and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic ends,5
9439,it's easy to charge as it uses a standard micro usb to charge itself and a free cable is included,5
9440,the other reviewers are correct when they say this is a custom fit they're not joking,5
9441,i tested the charger with my kindle fire hd 7 34 and my wife's iphone 4 connected to the other,5

9443,also the phone can be laid down on it's face without the screen touching the surface,5
9444,i purposely left the device off the charger to see how long it would take to charge each of these individually,5
9445,5 cm x 2 cm but fairly weighty for a unit of this capacity but it's too heavy for a pocket,5
9446,this little machine is well made and fits the samsung galaxy note 2 phone perfectly,5
9447,he tells me it is by far the best and easiest screen protectors to put on,5
9448,these have enough power to make it through the day even with low usage,5

9454,so far so good i have had to use it it worked just fine,5
9455,i had this case in pink and black for my samsung galaxys ii tmobile t-989 even with a case cover it fits,5
9456,the case also comes with a changeable plate on the back of the case instead opting to put it tastefully on the side,5
9457,i wanted a case to carry my soundlink around with me when i travel but generally they are pretty big and bulky,5
9458,it is stylish and it is just what i needed and was looking for,5

9461,this docking station is a great way to keep it clean,5
9462,and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone looking for a new battery,5
9463,it is small and unobtrusive so i can use it in the evening while in bed without worrying about the charge,5
9464,fortunately they are easy to use and apply cause no loss of touch sensitivity and not too sticky when swiping my finger across it,5
9465,once it's installed it's stays put and i'm confident that it won't fall apart like some do,5
9466,it feels great in my hand and even with the case it fits easily in your pants pocket,5
9467,there is nothing over the front of the phone so i don't know if just rinsing it and drying it will work,5
9468,i work in some rough places but this case keeps my phone safe from every day wear and tear,5
9469,i was very pleased with the quality of this case it doesn't get much better than that,5
9470,we originally purchased twootterbox commuter case for motorola droid razr maxx this case is a very well made and powerful usb charger,5

9479,i bought this a while back and i am still using it every day as i drive for a living,5
9480,i would say that although this power bank is capable of charging my nexus 7 at 1110,5
9481,i got the wall charger so i can always charge my ipod when i need to,5
9482,easy to use and pair with your device and the sound quality is also great for both inbound and outbound sound,5
9483,i've only had it for a few days now and it seems to be working,5
9484,it uses a resistive touch screen so it's not going to be super protective but it does the job,5
9485,also does not get in the way of using the feature,5
9486,easy to put my phone in and never have to worry about a dead cell battery wherever i go,5
9487,all of these are convertible between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable,5
9488,perfect fit for my iphone 4s and i don't feel it i do not use a case,5
9489,then i charged my s3 from 27 % to 100 % the powerpak still had 4 34 bars,5
9490,i have had one of these on my phone for over a year my battery life started getting pretty shameful,5
9491,the protector went on smoothly and i had a few bubbles that were easily removed with the included squeegee and it comes with 2,5
9492,i have used the anker batteries and they are just as good as any i've tried and i can easily recommend them,5
9493,overall i wouldn't have a problem with it myself however,5
9494,the case also has a great rubber texture along the edges of the case really help the phone survive his wrath,5
9495,as an added bonus this cable is a bit longer than the cords that come with the phones,5
9496,it writes smooth and is accurate and i've never had any problems with this cable by eforcity and would buy again if needed,5
9497,some chargers will let you pound away on your phone or tablet and an excellent video to guide you through it all,5
9498,it is durable and worth looking into buying for those of you who have never seen one the case consists of two layers,5
9499,love that this had two usb's haven't used it yet but i did do a temporary check of this item,5

9502,i know for a fact that there is no way to swap batteries if one dies,5
9503,the color is great and it fit my phone perfectly i am very happy with the product and the item arrived quickly,5
9504,you lose the stand on the back of this case and mcgyver'd a kick stand into it,5
9505,the case is great quality and it came sooner than expected and the price was extremely reasonable,5
9506,i also like that it can be used to charge two devices at once,5
9507,one will last a couple of months and the best part is there is an audible sound when the phone is charging,5
9508,i've tested charging my galaxy note 3 from 20 % to 50 % in 1 hour,5
9509,no worries here 8211 this did not get hot or have any other issues as some non-oem products do,5
9510,it seems solidly built and it has a blue led light to tell you its charging,5
9511,so i started looking for a device like this i wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to a friend,5
9512,i have a white iphone 4 and i can't even tell there's a screen protector on my phone,5
9513,they are also good for running and i don't have to push any buttons to reconnect after turning it off,5
9514,i had been looking for a screen protector that went all the way up to the very edge of the screen,5
9515,with my galaxy nexus these are a must have to prolong the life of your screens continue to use your blackberry case,5
9516,lip comes around the side of the case to protect the phone from scratches without making the phone bulky,5
9517,it is compact simple in design and does what it is supposed to do quite well and will last a long time,5
9518,i now now feel free to use my phone as much as possible phone calls sms internet browsing streaming music youtube etc,5
9519,i've read that the battery is supposed to work with any set of batteries so that's good,5
9520,everyone always complains about how hard these are to put on but if you read the box you should be good,5
9521,bluetooth earpieces allow hands free talking or listening to music on a long flight draining the battery,5
9522,great product bought it for my son and he's happy with them,5
9523,unlike previous versions i can place the phone in my pocket and no problems with fitting,5

9525,it has 4 hours of talk time which is a big plus for me,5
9526,it has a grippy texture so it doesn't slip out of my hand when i am holding it with the cover closed,5
9527,the case arrived a head of schedule and has a nice feel to it and easy to grip so it hasn't slipped,5
9528,i like to walk with them and i dont have to worry about accidentally pulling the plug out cons 1,5
9529,now when the power go out they will be able to charge their phone or tablet all at the same time,5
9530,everything was made to fit and i'm really pleased with the perfect fit and pretty design of this cover,5
9531,i compared them to the headphones that came with my s4 and these are just like the ones i bought with my phone,5
9532,now it does add some bulk to the phone but not much especially considering how much protection it provides,5
9533,i've started using it in the middle of the night you'll only see a small dot,5
9534,it also has a kick stand that comes in handy when i am using my handwriting app 1,5
9535,it pairs right up when i get in the car and turn on the ignition,5
9536,one nice thing about the otterbox is that it doesn't have frontal protection,5
9537,i have had the case for a few weeks now and in testing i can get two full charges on an iphone 4s,5
9538,it does not dock in my radio but i can't fault the product for that because it clearly states 4 feet,5
9539,it is a huge pain to replace this part so make sure you buy a few packs of these especially for the price,5
9540,i get so many compliments and what i really like is that it's kind of expensive for just a cable,5
9541,it was very easy to apply and i like the feel of the case as well,5
9542,it's so nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on an otterbox,5
9543,i am amazed at the quality of this little projector which is a good thing since i intend to take it along when i travel,5
9544,when you 8217 re driving and can not take the time to read the instructions and follow the instructions to the letter,5
9545,this has protected the phone many times and has been on for over a year and it still looked brand new,5
9546,at any rate most will never have to worry about recharging your phone again,5
9547,there are four small leds that indicate how much of a charge is left 4-3-2-1,5
9548,although the back cover cracked after a few weeks of use both of these issues have gone away,5
9549,it securely holds the phone and i haven't been able to use it even once,5
9550,i love amazon i bought this and it looks great on my white iphone5 and it truly glows in the dark,5
9551,i think it looks great on the white version of this phone which my daughter has,5
9552,also has a little lip over the screen so you can put the phone face down without fear of scratching your screen,5
9553,if you are looking for the best anti-glare anti-fingerprint works like a charm even better than expected,5
9554,it comes with 3 pieces a cleaning cloth and a small plastic smoother to remove bubbles,5
9555,eventually someone will design a charger which will quickly charge an ipad and will also quickly charge newer iphones and ipods,5
9556,the case is efficient attractive and is a great item to have when you have kids and you travel,5
9557,the audio cord is thin and i don't know how many times i have dropped my phone and the phone itself is fine,5
9558,for ten bucks you can safety charge a smartphone and a tablet at the same time or two phones,5
9559,it is easy to get on and off and it has raised textured side buttons,5
9560,it is also very easy to get in and of pocket and feels solid in your hand compared to other much more expensive cases,5
9561,it is not as thick as the ones they sell at att t if not better,5
9562,since it's made out of tpu it's very light weight and fits easily into my cargo shorts,5
9563,ok so i just got this shield today and have only had it on my phone for close to a year,5
9564,pairing is easy simply press and hold the power button to turn it on or off,5
9565,i love the tips that come with it and the fact that it has a little kick stand in the back of the case,5
9566,i don't use this device very often but when i am on a longer trips i find that this bluetooth receiver is perfect,5
9567,this is a big minus but don't want to take the time to use these units correctly,5
9568,i love the circuitboard design and the case does a good job of covering the edge to edge screen,5
9569,the faux-leather feels good to the touch and has a super smooth surface,5
9570,i have gotten bad ones in the past but this one is the best hands down,5
9571,when i got my nexus 4 last week there was no question as to whether i would buy this genuine samsung product,5
9572,haven't had any scratching issues yet but i've only had it about a week and am liking it,5
9573,i have not used the usb port on the charger to your mobile device,5
9574,i really liked this case it fits really well and doesn't interfere with recognition,5
9575,i have had this case for about a week and still no stracthes on the screen,5
9576,the half-star off is because it doesn't come with a screen protector like the one which shipped with their dx-5,5
9577,i have been using this belkin iphone 5 sport case for about a month now and so far i am well satisfied with it,5
9578,on my first full charge i was able to charge my phone too,5
9579,if it's angled it's going to have a hard time deciding who gets this one,5
9580,i have put several screen protectors on and i have to say this was one of the best purchased i made,5
9581,my old one lasted a few years and i'm impressed with their customer service and follow up,5
9582,when i call her i no longer have to wait to use my phone,5
9583,the rubbery feel gives it great grip so that it doesn't feel like it is going to slip out of your hand,5
9584,the unit arrived with about a 3 4ths charge i plugged in my phone and it quickly built up the charge on the phone,5
9585,it's not an otterbox and i don't expect it to last a really long time,5
9586,i am looking at my phone with the case on but the touch screen works easy enough,5
9587,it is on the larger size so if you have small hands it will probalby be too big,5
9588,it's not intrusive the power and volume buttons are covered by the case but easy to press,5
9589,i thought it would look cheap since the price is so low but it far exceeded my expectations,5
9590,fingerprints can show up from time to time but they are very easy to control very light and sound very good,5
9591,overall very happy and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great looking case that provided great protection for my cherished blackberry,5
9592,bottom line is that this is a great case i have reviewed it as well,5
9593,i have several new trent batteries and this one is by far the best one i have owned,5
9594,pretty easy to put on once you get the hang of it its easy to dock the phone,5
9595,my favorite part is that it doesn't pull my hair like the otter box does,5
9596,i purchased the multi-pack because my wife also has a samsung focus and she has the same timeout issues,5
9597,the edges of the cover wrap around the phone so that you can put your micro-usb cord and charge your phone directly,5
9598,you can have two tablets or a tablet and a phone can be charged at the same time,5
9599,to turn it on you have to give it a couple of days before i expected to,5
9600,protects the phone and does not take away from the beauty of the phone,5
9601,i had to get a replacement i decided to replace it with a better-insulated rg6 cable,5
9602,i love the looks of it and i have dropped my phone accidentally several times on pavement and not a scratch,5
9603,seems they should have made the stand in mind with a case on the phone but it wasn't advertised to do so,5
9604,it paired easily with my smartphone and comes with a charging cable and several adapters placed in a plastic bag,5
9605,it is thin but yet still protects my phone on the sides with it's padded spring release sides is great,5
9606,really all in all this is the best cable i've used with my iphone and it works great,5
9607,1a port is labeled and it makes it easier to find in the bottom of my bag,5
9608,i only had the one that came with the phone you can just plug it in to charge right inside my handbag,5
9609,without ever plugging the device in to charge before use i was able to get 2 items a the cost of one,5
9610,this silicone case protected my phone perfectly while using this case i didn't have any problems at all with the side or top buttons,5
9611,the na port charges the kindles in a couple of hours and the correct cord within a couple of days,5
9612,i do have to say that my mother-in-law is still using it nearly two years later,5
9613,i use it to charges my ipad 3 and iphone 5 at the same time and the duracell gopower worked great,5
9614,like all slim cases the protection is always going to be the one you have with you,5
9615,love the case and the fact that it ships prime i must say that this is by far the best one i'v tried,5
9616,it looks sleek and feels good in your hand not bulky or slippery,5
9617,the only thing is that they take like 5 hours to charge but i dont see it will be a problem with this case,5
9618,the answer function worked without incident and the person on the other end said it was good too,5
9619,i'm happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends,5
9620,for such a low price i didn't expect much out of this little thing,5
9621,this paticular brand works very well and does not add a lot of bulk to the profile of the galaxys iii,5
9622,i ordered this case on a thursday and it arrived tues after super fast,5
9623,4 amp dual usb car charger is a great little charger that performs well as a travel charger,5
9624,the pink isn't quite as hot as the picture shows but it's a good idea of what they look like,5
9625,i ordered two other cases before this one and it is by far the best screen protected i've ever bought,5
9626,but it does i also like the fact that it has 2 usb charge ports,5
9627,the camera holes are larger so you don't have to have two chargers in your car,5
9628,great for on the go as i use my phone all day for reports audits pictures emails calls and media,5
9629,this is the exact same charger that came with my phone i'll be purchasing a couple or so more,5
9630,my phone is still working well with the battery and i have had it for a while now and it is very durable and strong,5
9631,i definitely recommend this product as a matter of fact i wish i had marked the battery,5
9632,i have one for my i pod and loved it so i got this for my mom's phone she loves it,5
9633,it offers three options for charging so that you can get the phone screen really clean using reflections as your guide,5
9634,good noise cancellation so that the person on the other end of the call regarding noise static etc,5
9635,i bought it because i only cary two cards so i don't have to worry anymore or mess with turning on bedside mode etc,5
9636,i love the fact that i don't have to run to the at t store to actually feel it in my hand,5
9637,i particularly like the built in cable it's one less thing to worry about and that's a very good thing,5
9638,the ultimate solution the new trent nt90c wall charger and i was able to charge samsung galaxy s4,5
9639,it fits like a glove although the on off button is a bit hard to press but it's definitely tolerable,5
9640,the track ball is slightly recessed and is easy to use and the rubber end seems pretty secure,5
9641,so if you're wanting a case that will protect your iphone 5s from many bumps and bruises,5
9642,one in the cradle and the phone plugged into the usb port on the battery whenever you need to charge the phone,5
9643,i could also feel the music in the palm of my hand it is so easy to use it holds my phone extremely well,5
9644,it was very easy to pair up the transmitter with my cell phone and it arrived in a very timely manner,5
9645,i have many cases for my phone so i can use it when i put my phone in it never gets lost,5
9646,bottom line this is the best slim case out there for the samsung galaxy note 3 it still does the job,5
9647,easy installation and i have dropped my phone in it and both the phone and case received no damage whatsoever,5
9648,i would definitely recommend this seller and will buy from them again and will tell friends about it,5
9649,i really don't see the difference between these and the oem cords we got with our phones,5
9650,i bought this item because i wanted to be able to use with my iphone 5 also a recent purchase,5
9651,definitely a buy if you're looking for a case that is not bulky and still fits in my pocket,5
9652,the best part about it is that it is very small compared to well anything else,5
9653,as with any screen protector you need to make sure your screen is absolutely clean since the included cleaning cloth is useless,5
9654,i purchased a case that came with a screen protector which i didn't use,5
9655,great for going out with the girls for a night on the town this case provides the shine and sophistication i need,5
9656,to date i have had my charger for a few weeks and overall i am pretty impressed with it,5
9657,reports are that it is a good idea to talk on the cell phone itself while driving,5
9658,just be careful when taking the phone out of the case to put it in here it stretches just fine,5
9659,exactly as described and exactly what i needed to be able to charge multiple devices via usb in their vehicle,5
9660,i bought this phone last october 2013 from verizon and is very happy with it and it protects her alcatel phone very well,5
9661,this product seamed to get more then enough good reviews for me to take a chance and i'm glad i did,5
9662,it fits well and is easy to put on with no annoying bubbles,5
9663,the protector went on like any other and it was nice to have some that match her new cases that she ordered,5
9664,i felt the need to get a case for my phone because i am forever dropping my phone on the floor,5
9665,i find that extremely useful as my htc evo 4 g so i dont have to juggle my cell and my work cell anymore,5
9666,had all of the tools and also included a screen protector and cleaning cloth because i wasn't expecting that,5
9667,i love this charger for my nexus 5 and nexus 7 at the same time and both got fully charged in about 3,5
9668,it literally only takes my phone close to an hour and a half to charge my phone to 100 % in about 2,5
9669,something to note it ships from hong kong so don't be in any hurry to get them,5
9670,the nt140r should be able to charge my iphone as well as my ipad and ipad mini,5
9671,i am still hoping not to drop my phone but i still like to have cases on there,5
9672,the case is so cute and it came with a screen protecter and a screen wipe,5
9673,the cover is very easy to put on the phone and the case uses usb you lose access to that port,5
9674,29 in lightning port gps no cellular versions have gps samsung galaxy note 10,5
9675,always having at least one fully charged battery is awesome i no longer have charging issues and it stays charged for much longer,5
9676,the two major downsides being having to take the case apart to confirm the back is plastic and not aluminum,5
9677,the rounded edges are nice because i can carry it in my pocket and use it when i need it,5
9678,this hasn't happened to me though the case will still protect your iphone from minor drops and bumps,5
9679,i think this is a high quality case and one of the best i have used as a car mount,5
9680,so as an iphone 5 user i knew i wasn't going to get my iphone back yes the bond is that strong,5
9681,i love that i can keep my case on the phone and still use the icarpus stand,5
9682,4 thickness you can hold your phone on top of the charger and the battery gets recharged,5
9683,the case itself has protects the entire phone with a cutout for the camera eye and allows the back of the phone to reveal it,5
9684,it uses a resistive touch screen so it's not going to be super protective but it does the job,5
9685,if it does just use the usb cable that came with my phone back and forth between my home and vehicle,5
9686,what really impressed me was the fact that the case is thinner than the gorilla boxes,5
9687,need to use provided otg cable unit also has over-charge protection which stops supplying current once the battery is full,5
9688,the case is great for phone protection and allows for full access to the buttons and touch screen,5
9689,20 days of charging is a long time to be able to use a dock but no problem accessing the charging port or buttons,5
9690,pros first of all i have to say i love it it still looks great and feels good in your hand,5
9691,well worth 20 now i don't have to worry about it much with this phone,5
9692,there is also a small raised edge on the front of the case would look cheap but it doesn't,5
9693,using this blackberry d series extra battery charger i can charge an extra battery and the phone at the same time with only 1 charger,5
9694,kept my phone protected very strong and sturdy i dropped it a few times and it has protected the phone from serious damage,5
9695,clarity is real good and for the price it's a great way to protect my investment,5
9696,this battery can be charged with a micro usb cable when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic,5
9697,with the legend's proprietary magnetic charging port all you need to do is to click bluetooth and re-pair,5
9698,nice simple case have had it for several months and it still looks new,5
9699,i was very please it arrived on time and it fits like a glove,5
9700,so i am buying another m50 right now because it is without a doubt the strongest case i have ever had and fits perfect,5
9701,i believe you can turn off the blue light on the jabra is solid and not interference for me,5
9702,what i like the most about the otterbox defender case is that it's not the best but it's not the worst either,5
9703,ok so i've had this case for about 2 months now and it is still holding up great,5
9704,my old screen protector only lasted about a year in my pocket with keys and stuff and had a small scratch,5
9705,one huge plus to this unit is that the unit comes with a samsung galaxy s3 adapter installed,5
9706,aside from some minor issues with the application of the screen protector is straightforward if you had any experience in applying them,5
9707,i have tried 4 different cases and this is the best i've had from any mount,5
9708,now i don't like hello kitty but when i saw this i just had to have it,5
9709,i use this for running and have had it for several months the charge lasts for several days,5
9710,overall i am happy with the product and the price is very reasonable,5
9711,i am attaching a collage of several photos which can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo,5
9712,i took to amazon and came up with the black version of this case i decided to repurchase it in black,5
9713,good its connects and set up is easy but there is a lot of dust that gets trapped in there,5
9714,this screen protector is amazing it's easy to use and i highly recommend it,5
9715,if i had to guess i would have to say that these are well worth the price,5
9716,now that it's on you can't even notice it at all,5
9717,also since i am a techie person i will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours,5
9718,it is a beautiful case that is sturdy yet has a great feel to it and also seems to have good drop protection,5
9719,if your phone isn't a smart phone so i don't know how the reception is,5
9720,you'll still need to order a screen protector if you're clumsy like me this is the case you need,5
9721,note that the battery pack can be recharged from a pc through a usb port and outputs dc 5v at 1a,5
9722,in the end i would recommend this case for someone looking for minimal protection and near naked look,5
9723,it protects the phone great and i like that it protects the screen some by extending out a bit,5
9724,using the wall charger that came with the phone but i still want protection,5
9725,on the other hand i love the ability to listen to my audio without having the wires attached,5
9726,i love thes note app i use this all the time and would highly recommend this mophie,5
9727,with this charger i won't have to worry about it to slide off table,5
9728,i didn't have to use it because i had to return the phone due to manufacturer defects,5
9729,it fits nicely and it's very easy to use and put on,5
9730,the only thing is i keep it away from the edge of the phone inward as the case edge gets in the way,5
9731,i like the design though i do wish it was a little bit smaller in size,5
9732,i voted 5 5 because this is an excellent screen protector and provides full coverage of the screen,5
9733,this works for my phone and it doesn't seem to warn me,5
9734,there is a large round button on the side of the phone while in the commuter,5
9735,the only thing about it is that i don't have to leave my phone on the other side of the desk,5
9736,these are really nice anti-glare anti-fingerprint matte screen protector with lifetime replacement warranty 3-pack at t verizon,5
9737,iottie hlcrio101 one-touch xl windshield dashboard car mount holder for iphone 4s is great sturdy,5
9738,great product works great new phone so i needed a new mount that would fit my phone,5
9739,first of all it is easy to use and really convenient,5
9740,the flashlight is handy and turns on off with a double click of the power button,5
9741,next the speaker makes a really loud chime when you turn it on and when you try to pair devices,5
9742,very pleased with the purchase and would buy it again if i needed another case,5
9743,i am always on the lookout for a way to keep my devices charged and ready by using this well made product,5
9744,i'm very happy with the case i would recommend to my friends and family enemies too,5
9745,has a nice lip on the front that allows you to put the phone in both landscape and portrait,5
9746,i love that i do not need to remove the mboard,5
9747,if not for this battery i would not have been able to make or get important phone calls,5
9748,high quality just like the originals and charge at the same speed as the wall charger it's plugged into,5
9749,it is so delicate looking in appearance yet sturdy enough to protect my phone if i drop it cuz it feels so protected,5
9750,i recently purchased the new trent iphone case and i have to say that i have been pleased with the performance of the phone,5
9751,2 it is easy to understand and i love the fact it allows you to be hands-free,5
9752,this means you watch movies and play and never have to worry about a dead battery on your iphone or ipad,5
9753,i purchased this case so that i could test it out,5
9754,i carried the charger with me in my pocketbook and used it to charge my son's ipod and that took about an hour,5
9755,my husband spends his day text and sending emails and it has been a great phone but i've worn it out,5
9756,it's one of the clearest smoothest screen protectors i've ever put on a phone that had no bubbles at all,5
9757,she had dropped the phone a couple of times on concrete no damage to the phone and only scuffs to the case,5
9758,i like everything about this case it fits my phone perfect and all the little gems and pearls were glued well,5
9759,1 inch then this is the case you want to get,5
9760,easy to put on barely any bubbles if you do it right and last a long time,5
9761,the vent clip on looked complicated but since i wasn't going to use it to recharge a portable battery charger,5
9762,second i was a little surprised that it didn't come with any instructions but easy to figure out,5
9763,as a bonus it's small size makes it easy to carry as it only weighs 80 grams,5
9764,for hands free i use a bluetooth headset all of which use micro usb connections for charging ports,5
9765,most people leave it to the new purchaser to figure out how to get the sticky stuff off the button,5
9766,with the new trent dual usb car charger is a must-have,5
9767,i was needing a replacment cover for my phone and this is the best i've seen on the market,5
9768,this case offers the right kind of protection i was looking for in a case for my new iphone 4s,5
9769,this is by far the best one i have used for my iphone 5,5
9770,i will definitely buy this again the only problem is the little 34 diamonds 34 on the back fall out,5
9771,this part did exactly that but it was one of the most valuable accessories to have along,5
9772,the phone is pretty thin and this case gives it a little dwayne the rock johnson bedazzling i,5
9773,overall even if you don't intend to use this as a phone protective case inside a larger bag,5
9774,this glass screen protector does a really good job of reducing the amount of fingerprints that make it on the screen,5
9775,first of all it has a generous 2000mah capacity which is enough to basically double your normal iphone5s battery life,5
9776,i got this as my second case for my iphone 4 and when i sold it the phone was in pristine condition,5
9777,it can sync with both cell phones and i can use it with any of my cases either,5
9778,i always buy my screen protectors from amazon rearth this is a very good product but can be very difficult to install correctly,5
9779,i had one for an android phone which i used for a couple of years and i contemplated getting it fixed locally for like 100,5
9780,i removed the screen protector and i couldn't believe how easy it was to apply it no air bubbles left afterwards and no faults,5
9781,if you are really hard on your phone or work in an environment that might not be safe for smart phones,5
9782,this thing is very easy to set up the bluetooth with my phone and it holds the connection without any troubles,5
9783,they go on great they are very clear and don't interfere with the touch screen functionality at all,5
9784,it pairs easily with compatible devices simply by holding down the power button for a couple seconds to fire it up,5
9785,i bought this product for my samsung galaxy 3 note and this is perfect,5
9786,there is an on off switch on the top of the unit which has an led screen showing the level of charge,5
9787,i bought this samsung for my girlfriend she likes it so i like it,5
9788,a full charge on an ipad is good for 10 hours of use no matter what you do to improve it,5
9789,from a full charge i was able to use the phone with the cover in place,5
9790,the screen protector was easy to apply and was able to use my phone while it is charging,5
9791,it has a cool feel to it and can be held in one hand,5
9792,it has a bright flashlight and is compact enough to carry around in my jeans pocket even the tight ones,5
9793,if you want a generic case that will save your phone from a full height drop you will need something thicker,5
9794,i like the keyboard it has a nice feedback and once i got used to them it was no problem at all,5
9795,this protector is durable and it was easy to apply and there were no bubbles,5
9796,the plug usb connection is on the side of the device with the power button on the phone,5
9797,in a full sun through the screen in 45 minutes i had a full charge and the external battery was at 32 %,5
9798,very light fits in the ear well and after a couple of days i noticed that the line was completely gone,5
9799,so when i came across this i had to have it for my phone,5
9800,this is actually my second case for my iphone 4 and was happy to get one for my new phone,5
9801,my two year old has thrown and dropped my phone numerous times and both the case and the phone with a single cable,5
9802,i have been waiting on this charger for a long time overall i give it 5 stars,5

9809,99 at google play which allows you to use your own wall charger from your phone or other device and the instructions for the backbeat,5
9810,unfortunately these are no longer available but they are by far the best pair that i have owned,5
9811,impressions i've used this charger in my car for over a month now and my husband has the same one,5
9812,about 2 days after i put this case on my phone i must have dropped it about 15 times,5
9813,perhaps one of the things i like about it is that this unit has 4,5
9814,its bright red theres a little light at the end would be such a game changer,5
9815,sound quality is much better than i expected and worked great,5
9816,i was a little skeptical about this considering some of the bad reviews but it seems like this is the only way,5
9817,the design is solid that seems like it will hold up to on the go bumps and bruises,5
9818,unfortunately the micro usb charging end of the cable doesn't fully seat in an ipad air,5
9819,however those cases are gigantic ugly they interfere with the touch screen and it does it's job,5
9820,for 22 this product is a must have if you have motorola 9 34 tablet in case,5
9821,the microfiber tip is really nice since it doesn't stick to the inside of his pants pockets,5
9822,i got the droid 3 when it first came out and loved it so i decided to get this rather than pay for another otterbox,5
9823,i very quickly paired this speaker with my iphone 5 and ipad mini no case used on either product,5
9824,when i go without a purse this is the perfect way to keep one with you all the time,5
9825,i have to say that it's really hard to tell the difference without a close scrutiny,5
9826,everyone has had that feeling when their phone is about to die and it isn't even noon yet,5
9827,i assume that this one much be better but i can't tell any difference between this and the oem i have,5
9828,once you get it on it is hands down the best screen protector for the note 2 sold here on amazon,5

9855,first off they are bose so listening to music from your phone and then if a call comes in answer it,5
9856,this is good for me as i don't have to take my iphone5 out of the case to charge or use headphones,5
9857,however otterbox's web-site indicates that it will allow you to adjust several inches in any direction,5
9858,it contains 4 leds that let you know when the battery pack is charging or when it is charging your device s,5

9878,the purpose of the case is to protect the phone and it did it's job just fine,5

9880,this is a true bumper and only covers the edges of the phone to protect the screen if placed on a surface,5
9881,the only issue is that the bottom portion of the case adds a little bit more weight that a regular case,5
9882,it covers the corners and the silver edges of the face of the phone and the buttons don't work while on call,5

9925,after a short tutorial she was able to charge the unit and use a headphone without taking the case off,5
9926,i like the feel of it it makes the phone easier to grip and not so slippery,5

9944,i gave it to my daughter in law and she likes it a lot than the other one i got her,5
9945,but on the other hand it doesn't add much bulk or weight to the phone,5

9956,its a fine solution which is why i gave it 5 stars but i just wanted to give a heads up,5
9957,i think this is one of the best screen protectors i have used at an excellent price,5

9959,if you're looking for a power bank that you can carry in your pocket i don't see much value to,5

9970,i use it back and forth from my living room to the kitchen and the sound was not distorted,5

9986,i got this for his phone it was way cheaper than getting it off of otterbox it does the job,5
9987,the case is very slim and does not add significant weight or bulk to the phone which is great,5
9988,the thing is you really don't have to use this little gem often but when i do it is very handy,5
9989,i use this mainly when i travel so i wont have to try and keep up with it,5
9990,thanks why i order it and it came pretty fast about 3 days later,5
9991,i guess the only issue would be that it takes longer to charge this battery than others i've used,5
9992,i plug it in next to my bed and i can charge my iphone ipad blackberry and kindle all at the same time,5
9993,i was very please it arrived on time and it seems to work fine,5
9994,however this fully charged my ipad from 0 % to 100 % almost a full hour quicker than my s3 charger,5
