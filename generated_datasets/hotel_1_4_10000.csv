422,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
423,it's just not worth the money that i spent,1
424,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1

539,didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big fan of the 1970s decor or the dirty carpet either,1
540,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and a dead lady bug on the bed,1
541,there are tons of hotels motels around the country and this was one of the worst places i've ever staid at,1

560,i walked in the room and hair on the bathroom floor,1
561,they shared no details with us about the power outage we had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
562,the minute i got to the hotel they couldn't find the reservation on their end,1

580,they said they were completely booked i couldn't get towels for my room,1
581,when i arrived at the hotel at 9 00 pm after waking up at 3 30 am and it woke us up,1
582,motel 6 would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and a chevron across the parking lot with their luggage,1
583,well to start off the front desk person leaves at 10 p,1
584,my tv in the room had an awful smell to it,1
585,this was my 2nd stay at super 8 my last the room smelled of mildew the stove fridge and shower were broken,1
586,the room was small the bed was hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
587,i had to get out of there fast enough,1

589,when we complained and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
590,we asked if we could move to a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1
591,we needed separate beds and the room we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
592,unless i am desperate for a hotel room in this area i would not recommed this place at all,1
593,i'm appalled by this place and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
594,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't have a room key,1
595,went to the front desk and told them there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1

597,instead of remodeling this hotel should be taken off the list,1
598,got a smoking room when we were supposed to stay two nights but left after one,1

604,i was told by a worker that the reason wifi doesn't work at all for my entire stay,1
605,the hotel was adequate but the room smelled like a cigaret ashtray when asked for another room,1
606,i wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower and there was no water to drink anywhere in the hotel except out of,1
607,since it was late we could not get another room until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
608,i asked to speak with the manager and she said she understood and there would be no charge for late cancellation,1
609,i received a call from the hotel front desk said to deal with it,1
610,we arrived at 2 and check-in was a bit slow not horrible,1
611,even called the front desk to talk to,1
612,all we wanted was a place to sleep this isn't even worth it,1
613,as we arrived late we went inside to check in there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
614,first of all the pictures of the rooms must be from when it was a smoking room,1
615,this was the worst hotel i stayed at and it shouldn't be considered a non-smoking room had cigarette burns in it,1

942,this room was absolutely disgusting dirty towels and sheets with stains,1
943,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
944,after such a wonderful day me and my family will not stay in a days inn ever again,1

946,my room was non-smoking but once i walked into the room it was very dirty and the shower was very dirty,1
947,one of the keys did not work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
948,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
949,that problem was cordially taken care of at the front desk was helpful and brought us a rollaway,1
950,based on my experience i can't even get them to help me,1
951,no hot water manager acted like he didn't care about price at this point,1

955,this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
956,first room was non-smoking but once i walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place,1
957,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,1
958,as i walk over to third floor where my room was i noticed that the hotel was under construction from 9am-5pm monday-friday,1
959,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst hotel i have ever seen,1

966,one of the keys did not work and no towels in first room,1
967,i kept waiting for the ceiling tile in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
968,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
969,its on a very loud street that's also one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had,1
970,we were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
971,the second night i was there the i'm guessing local kids throw are so disruptive,1
972,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in,1
973,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
974,carpet in the room was worn out,1
975,would never stay there or recommend this place to anyone i will actively seek a refund,1
976,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
977,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1
978,this was very clean but other than that it needs a major face lift,1
979,sad to say but this place should be shut down and gutted,1
980,the chair in the room still had crumbs on it like it wasn't vacuumed,1
981,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
982,i will not be staying at this hotel and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
983,the location is out in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
984,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
985,the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a new set to put on the bed,1
986,when i went to take a shower and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
987,the bathroom light was burned out the first night and charged my credit card twice,1

989,bathroom in the room was very dirty,1
990,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
991,do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
992,this was not the room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
993,we both woke up in the morning with a credit soooooo helpful,1
994,one of the keys did not work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
995,one of the downstairs doors to get in the room i checked with the front,1
996,also they could add additional fee that i did not want to wait and headed straight to the beach,1
997,i'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was covered with trash and there were stray cats walking around,1
998,they need to find a new hotel at 11 pm after a long drive,1
999,oh and the front desk woman was rude,1
1000,parked my truck and trailer in the parking lot and cops at the reception desk,1
1001,check in was awkward as the front desk person was nice enough to only charge us for one pet 75,1
1002,there were stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in a non-smoking room was not non-smoking,1
1003,i'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
1004,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
1005,we contacted the front desk and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
1006,we moved to another room unpacked and then realized shower didn't work and telephone by the bed didn't work,1
1007,first off for the price we paid the hotel itself was very nice but there wasn't much she could do,1
1008,i couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for 5 minutes,1
1009,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst best western i have ever stayed in,1
1010,one of the staff told us there was nothing they could do because i booked my room through hotels,1
1011,the first room they put me in a king bed in the am i went to get coffee at 9 pm,1
1012,when we got there we had to call to find the place,1
1013,was not worth the money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
1014,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
1015,the furniture and carpet in the room needs a good cleaning,1
1016,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to get a trailer parked in,1
1017,the girls on the reception were very rude they didn't even have one they had no more towels,1
1018,i have actually stayed here before and the room wasn't cleaned because she thought we already checked out,1
1019,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
1020,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
1021,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience ever,1
1022,i guess they tried to make up for the need of repairs and renovations throughout the entire hotel,1
1023,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
1024,we got a handicap room and i told her i could not sleep well,1
1025,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what they were made of plastic,1
1026,for the cost of this room for one night and it was worth half that,1
1027,cable didn't work and we had to wait an hour for our room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible,1
1028,the sheets were wrinkled and gray and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
1029,the 3rd room had another smell we also discovered several bugs in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
1030,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
1031,i was told they only have the small room with 2 double beds at this location using the hotel chains website lq,1
1032,if we would have no showed the day of we would have been expected to sleep in that,1
1033,we got a handicap room and i told her i would have to talk to the front desk and they just said,1
1034,gave us a room that had a extra tv on the floor and the bathtub was not clean,1
1035,the receptionist said they didn't have another room available,1
1036,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have stayed at,1
1037,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
1038,this was by far one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in,1
1039,at this point i don't know what my total was for the night,1
1040,the entire facility is extremely run down and in need of drastic upgrading,1
1041,if you ever go to the front desk and told them what was going on,1
1042,we found the hidden microwave and mini fridge on the day we were supposed to stay two nights but left after 1,1
1043,and the breakfast sucked we didn't even stay there because it disgusting,1
1044,this time when we checked in they gave us a fan to stick in the window,1
1045,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
1046,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
1047,even the lobby had a funny smell and the room wasn't the cleanest and staff wasn't the nicest,1
1048,i arrived at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on it,1
1049,first let me say that i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
1050,had a reservation for this hotel but when i got to my room where the ac was off and had been for weeks,1
1051,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced for such a bad hotel in a bad area,1
1052,don't have the phone number for the manager to call me,1
1053,casino was fine but i will never go back there again,1
1054,i was very disappointed that room was not clean fan was broken and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
1055,when i called front desk and he said he would look for the dial,1
1056,the tub was so bad that we couldn't even feel comfortable enough to check out with her,1
1057,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a remote control old furniture,1
1058,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
1059,from the beginning i knew that this wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54,1
1060,front desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no record of my card ever being swiped,1
1061,we called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
1062,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,1
1063,the bathroom door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't really separated,1
1064,then property use to be own by country inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
1065,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
1066,not completely horrible but the room had not been cleaned nor vacuumed in some time,1
1067,the room smelled like smoke even though it was a room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
1068,i will never go back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
1069,he is rude and should not be stated as such,1
1070,i cant say one good thing about this room was the most disgusting motel i have ever stayed in,1
1071,white sheets had yellow stains and hair on them and the footprints were not ours,1
1072,i made a reservation for a non smoking room but the entire first floor smelled of smoke,1
1073,i was very unhappy with the condition of the hotel was a huge pain,1
1074,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking,1
1075,the carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
1076,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend the knights inn to anyone,1
1077,even before going to bed i canceled the rest of the hotel could use some updates,1
1078,the hotel was filthy and i would never stay there again,1
1079,i was worried about bed bugs and he said that it was a loud night for the trains,1
1080,however the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was not much better,1
1081,rooms are clean but the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
1082,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
1083,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in i was told there was wet bar,1
1084,we did get a dirty bathroom a toilet i had to ask for room service still waited over an hour,1
1085,when we walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
1086,we checked in 5 minutes later we were at the front desk was very friendly but the place was not my favorite,1
1087,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem to care about my situation will never stay there again especially for the price,1
1088,room serve not done until very late and had to ask for breakfast items and coffee hot water were never hotter than lukewarm,1
1089,then the room was trashing one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a coupon booklet for hotels,1
1090,well for starters my wife and i stayed at motel 6 in eloy az for 2 weeks,1
1091,even though this was a non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
1092,we went back to the front deck,1
1093,would not let me check in had to go to in mobile al and my wife wanted to come with me,1
1094,the room we were assigned should not have been renting rooms on the second floor and had ants on the night table and the desk,1
1095,we were given the room key to check out the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
1096,this was the only hotel we found with an outdoor pool in the area but they were booked due to the world series baseball game,1
1097,i arrived at the hotel i was told the reservation for the second room would be cancelled,1
1098,i would never stay at this location again,1
1099,we went to the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
1100,we had the heat full blast and we froze in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
1101,i immediately called the desk and asked for a receipt for the one night,1
1102,i had to ask for a wash cloth,1
1103,we payed for 3 people but they said they would get someone to look at it so they gave us a complimentry king room upgrade,1
1104,the conditions of the rooms was stinking so badly that we had to ask for room service still waited over an hour,1
1105,got to room after check in and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue,1
1106,the front desk person was not able to find my hhonors membership and claimed,1
1107,was moved to another room the shower was broken the toilet seat was stickey,1
1108,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and they told me the smaller charge was a mistake by the hotel staff,1
1109,hotel was fine for the price and for a 1 night stay this is not a safe place to bring kids,1
1110,com and due to this experience i don't think i will ever satay there again,1
1111,there was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
1112,i'm asking for my money back and he told me well it's a complimentary shuttle it's not guaranteed,1
1113,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and the um guests were a bit on the scary side,1
1114,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
1115,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
1116,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
1117,woke up with bites all over him he thought it might have been the swat team there is a bit of a disappointment and literally,1
1118,i tried to get a refund after the first night the sheets had not been changed from a prior guest,1
1119,but then my in-laws got the room next to me was showering in my room,1
1120,i cut my trip short and checked out a few days early i was given poor service from the manager,1
1121,we arrived late into the night and didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me,1
1122,there were also cigarette burns on the comforters in a non-smoking room was laden with the odor of cigarette smoke,1
1123,they said that was the only good thing about our stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
1124,dirty room with cokroch in bed hair all over the bathroom even trails of ants in the sink area,1
1125,i wouldn't be dissappointed if the room was the very strong oder,1
1126,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
1127,the air did not work so drove walked to front desk and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
1128,the front desk staff got it wrong first reason was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
1129,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
1130,this was very clean but other than that it needs a major face lift,1
1131,the room had a strong odor of pot in the hallway on the third floor below a giant,1
1132,it was soooooo filthy and the smell was so strong we kept the window open for the two days we were there,1
1133,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
1134,the room also smelled heavily of cigarette smoke and the bedding was stained,1
1135,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
1136,there were hookers and crack heads staying there and wandering in the parking lot in full view of the office,1
1137,i realized after staying here that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed,1
1138,i stay in a lot of hotels motels around where this place is so dirty,1
1139,window didnt open air conditioner did not run properly 5,1
1140,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
1141,it was a very bad experience and i would never stay there or recommend this place to anybody,1
1142,room looked like they had grease stains on them and when we asked them,1
1143,i would not recommend this hotel if you plan on checking in early,1
1144,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
1145,no one would talk to us and we had booked for 2 day's,1
1146,it was a horrible experience we paid in advance and arrived at night the street was was dark due to inadequate lighting,1
1147,when we first arrived at 4 15 pm the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked up in the hallway,1
1148,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room each time i left,1
1149,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
1150,it wasn't the hypodermic needle in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
1151,i knew this was going to be in my room,1
1152,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never experienced anything like this before,1
1153,the room was clean even though we had one in the previous room,1
1154,when i got in the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
1155,i really don't have a king size bed with no blankets,1
1156,the mattress was on top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs badly,1
1157,the door across from our room looked like it was kicked in the room had an odd smell,1
1158,they did not switch me rooms as they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
1159,com was deceiving looked nothing like the pictures on line do not look anything like the rooms once you get there,1
1160,when we arrived to the room the room smelled like urine,1
1161,dirtiest nasty hotel i've stayed in some dodgy places i have no problem with parking there until i find out they charged me 20,1
1162,so i would stay some where else at the last minute during week of the masters,1
1163,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
1164,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1
1165,i'll never recommend this hotel to friends and family,1
1166,she did not tell me till the next morning i checked out and continued to charge my credit card,1
1167,when i went to checkout i didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture,1
1168,too bad the staff was friendly extremely helpful and went out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
1169,we were told that they didn't have it worst hotel i've ever stayed at,1
1170,i advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they didn't have the option swimming either,1
1171,when we complained and asked for a refund right after we checked in,1
1172,the hotel itself was very clean and well-kept,1
1173,when my boyfriend took a shower the water wouldn't drain so we stood in ankle deep water was not pleasant,1
1174,i left the hotel and did not stay there because i was on the property for 10 minutes max,1
1175,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the bathroom with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there,1
1176,we we're told we would get shuttled to the port of long beach i highly recommend that you stay somewhere else,1
1177,this was by far one of the worst hotel i have ever stayed,1
1178,i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk if i could cancel and get a refund,1
1179,the room had a horrible smell to it and hair was found on the sheets as well,1
1180,i was desperate for a room and it was a great overall trip,1
1181,lol then he offered us another room and they told us there were none available,1
1182,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
1183,the resort itself was very nice but we will never ever stay there again,1
1184,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room one night,1
1185,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
1186,there was hair all over the bathroom the toilet looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in weeks,1
1187,someone banged on our door at 3 am and asked to be switched to another room whose tv remote didn't work either,1
1188,no one in my family got ready that morning and there was no button at the front door,1
1189,the accommodation was bad along with the customer service and have us a run around,1
1190,we were told we would not have rooms until the day of the booking and i was make as a no show,1
1191,i was not aware when i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to see what i would find under the comforter,1
1192,it was an okay room for the money but i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
1193,and finally we went down to the front desk and the phone did not work in the room and its cleanliness was questionable,1
1194,needless to say i couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for the night,1
1195,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and no sophisticated menu was available,1
1196,the front desk staff was not very welcoming,1
1197,when i booked i asked about it and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
1198,i do not recommend this place to anyone,1
1199,firstly you must know that this is a motel not a hotel or inn,1
1200,the funky sour old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room wasn't clean there were dirty dishes in the dish washer again,1
1201,this time they couldn't scan my credit card so they said i could not get a third key 3,1
1202,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
1203,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1
1204,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
1205,the first room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
1206,we went down to the desk no one answered the courtesy phone,1
1207,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
1208,it was by far the worst i have ever seen in a hotel room there was no cold water at all,1
1209,the only piece of furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
1210,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of maintenance,1
1211,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
1212,also the jacuzzi is locayed in the adult pool area so we could not stand to be in the condo,1
1213,there were splatter stains all over the walls in different areas of the room,1
1214,i am very disappointed at the four seasons,1
1215,we both will miss this place for the same price i wasn't offered compensation or anything,1
1216,we had to keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
1217,walked into the room and five minutes later they came and told me i had to check out of this hotel,1
1218,but he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
1219,when we went in the room after a long trip i didn't say anything more to him about it,1
1220,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
1221,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk samantha refused to honor it and was rather rude,1
1222,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
1223,thought it would be a decent place to sleep,1
1224,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most disgusting place i have ever stayed in,1
1225,our toilet was broken and they said they had none to move us too,1
1226,i ask for a receipt when checking out they said i could not get my money back from the hotel,1
1227,he was so unprofessional and as he didn't think we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else instead,1
1228,do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
1229,check in was awkward as the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
1230,i called the office about the light and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
1231,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
1232,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
1233,don't have the word i don't like to sign s with knowing what it is,1
1234,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no,1
1235,this was by far the worst hotel that i have ever stayed at,1
1236,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
1237,when we asked to talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
1238,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
1239,oh and the front desk was closed,1
1240,we do not recommend this place to anyone,1
1241,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
1242,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
1243,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
1244,my son needed a room for a disabled person,1
1245,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
1246,on the positive side the bed was comfortable but you can hear,1
1247,i will never stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
1248,way over priced for such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
1249,since i checked in late and i have already paid for the room it was a 30 room this is a very cheap hotel,1
1250,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed at,1
1251,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
1252,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
1253,i was surprised when i checked the room it was in the room,1
1254,the room was not what i booked or paid for and there was no gravy and a half of biscuit on display folks not cool,1
1255,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk and no on ever came to the room,1
1256,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
1257,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
1258,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallways,1
1259,i went back to the desk and said we could change rooms or get a refund,1
1260,elevator was broken and i will not recommend this motel to anyone,1
1261,then my boyfriend was sleeping in the car and was more comfortable,1
1262,i arrived late looking for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
1263,upon arrival they did not have any amenities as promised,1
1264,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
1265,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
1266,from the valet to the front desk they still charged me for the night anyway,1
1267,we arrived at 3 30 in the afternoon and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub,1
1268,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
1269,we made the reservation more than a week ahead of time since it was a wydham brand it couldn't be slept in,1
1270,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience,1
1271,i went back down to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves,1
1272,we were moved out of the room to share with others,1
1273,and when i mentioned we had no tv remote control in the room was very dirty,1
1274,first thing i saw when i walked into the bathroom only to see that there were roaches,1
1275,unfortainatley there were people in out of the room to share with others,1
1276,i knew i made a bad mistake when i went to the market and had baby food items and groceries on the counter,1
1277,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
1278,even called the front desk and told them what was going on in the parking lot all night,1
1279,we did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed,1
1280,if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
1281,i went back down to ask for a deposit shoot they should have been cleaning our room,1
1282,i tried to call the front desk and we had really spotty wifi,1
1283,we attempted to find other accommodations for the night but i would not return again,1
1284,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a remote control old furniture,1
1285,please don't stay here if you don't like it,1
1286,all the rooms on the first floor as i requested,1
1287,thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of there constantly from the highway that are not guests,1
1288,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
1289,when i checked in the desk clerk was very rude and unaccomidating,1
1290,they had to give me a refund i had to go to another hotel,1
1291,had to constantly kill them when i was in the room it's filthy and bugs are crawling around,1
1292,i called back one more time and the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
1293,com that she couldn't do anything about it so the,1
1294,they are in the middle of the night,1
1295,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
1296,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1
1297,they do not at this hotel and they were not queen size as advertised,1
1298,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and down in to the cushion,1
1299,well to start off the front desk person leaves at 10 p,1
1300,we didn't even want to complain because i don't think i will ever satay there again,1
1301,if i wasn't so tired and the room was not ready at the 3 pm check in,1
1302,we put a tip on the bed and no towels or soap,1
1303,upon entrance to our room we were greeted by the smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins,1
1304,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a worse experience,1
1305,other than location this hotel should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
1306,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
1307,when i went into the room the room smelled like cat urine and they did move us to another room,1
1308,we came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub i was not comfortable with that at all,1
1309,com and when i got to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
1310,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet paper or complimentary soaps,1
1311,i stayed here the staff was very rude i wouldn't never recommend or stay at a howard johnson again,1
1312,we just needed a room for his class reunion so i booked this at the last minute during week of the masters,1
1313,the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the room was the same and as clean in which the lady responded yes,1
1314,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to go get some at the gas station,1
1315,had a reservation for this hotel but when i got to the hotel they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website,1
1316,booked through groupon assumed this would be a decent place to stay between a and b but not recommended for a long stay,1
1317,the entire experience was bad and we would never stay here again and do not recommend it,1
1318,this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
1319,the main part of the hotel is nice i'll give it that,1
1320,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
1321,i was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here if you don't want your car to get vandalized,1
1322,the wifi was pathetic beyond pathetic i felt i was going to get shot or killed,1
1323,this was the worst hotel stay i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
1324,shoulda went to motel 6 at least there you kinda know what to expect when they check in their room,1
1325,unfortunately the room smelled horrible of stale cigarette smoke even in a non smoking room,1
1326,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
1327,everything smelled like cigarette smoke in a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke,1
1328,i arrived at the hotel i was in or used was very clean and quite nice,1
1329,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the price charged and i would not stay here again,1
1330,when we finally got into our room and found used underwear hanging from the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
1331,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and they gave our room away,1
1332,took a long time before we found out it was the heater and told them,1
1333,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and dirt around the edges of the bathroom,1
1334,we arrived at 3 30 in the afternoon and there was not a spot in the entire home that wasn't filled with something,1
1335,also i left a pair of sweat pants in my room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
1336,would not recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the towels wash cloth were old hard rough looking,1
1337,i wanted to call the front desk they did not care,1
1338,i tried to call the front desk to talk to,1
1339,he told me that the hotel staff didn't seem to care,1
1340,we were up for a family reunion i will never ever stay at a super 8,1
1341,toilet was overflowing when we got there it was 20 degrees at night and window wouldn't close,1
1342,the lock on our room door was broken and would not shut all the way,1
1343,it was hard to open and close them,1
1344,once i got to my room on the second floor where we were staying,1
1345,horrid the tv didn't work and it looked like white fluids that had dried,1
1346,i will never and i mean never stay at this hotel and i had to share a bed which i was poorly compensated for,1
1347,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
1348,from the beginning i knew that this wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54,1
1349,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
1350,the holiday inn front desk told me there was nothing they could do because they don't know it's gone,1
1351,i booked a non smoking room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
1352,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
1353,the rooms smelled weird and the staff was very nice extremely personable and friendly,1
1354,we live out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room,1
1355,my friend was on a budget otherwise i definitely would not have stayed passed the first five minutes,1
1356,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
1357,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
1358,i should get a refund it was so bad i didnt even go back for my 2nd night,1
1359,com had said it would be fixed when i got back to the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
1360,thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
1361,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
1362,this is the nastiest hotel we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1

1378,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the lobby back there the key difficult to use,1
1379,they put us on the first floor as i requested,1
1380,i will never use this company again nor recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the jr,1
1381,then when i went to the desk in the morning to request a later,1
1382,almost seemed liked the rule was you couldn't stay at this hotel it's disgusting in every sense,1
1383,when i checked in saying no refunds when i saw the name fiesta inn o though that it will be the last time as well,1
1384,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find a room in an area with none,1

1392,they make you pay in advance and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1
1393,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room motel style,1
1394,everywhere what is pg going to do this is to list all of the issues we had,1
1395,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a large upholstered chair up on one of the unmade beds,1

1402,no shower curtain in the bathroom and on top of all that the glasses for wine were dirty,1
1403,i asked for a room upgrade and was denied because i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
1404,the furniture in the room was in much need of updating,1
1405,we were up for a family reunion i will never ever stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
1406,if it was not for us driving all day and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
1407,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and the um guests were a bit on the scary side,1
1408,i called in advance to let them know we were in town for an extended period due to their job,1
1409,when i went down to the desk no one answered the courtesy phone,1
1410,this property was my preferred place to stay for the money in appleton,1
1411,i left a day early when they put me on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
1412,as a traveler i needed a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel,1

1415,would not stay here again i'll sleep somewhere else,1
1416,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
1417,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
1418,additionally the wifi doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is old or because i got up early to catch an early flight,1
1419,we came upstairs to look at the complaint of the customer,1
1420,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
1421,there was no way to take a shower and there was no one at the desk,1
1422,there is low income housing on the second floor there was puke on the stairs,1
1423,she then asked if i wanted to stay in that kind of environment,1
1424,she did not offer any kind of explanation just told me it wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54,1
1425,didn't have a double bed which wasn't a huge deal but they don't tell you that,1
1426,sheets had black stains on them mattress was extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1

1433,the room was clean however paint was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
1434,i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds as i had requested,1
1435,the first room we were given was dark had torn carpet the ac didn't work had to push to get a room change,1

1437,i will never stay at a red roof,1
1438,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend this hotel,1
1439,we asked where to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
1440,horrid the tv didn't work and the front desk was no help,1
1441,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
1442,com the room was dated and tired,1
1443,this is by far the worse i've ever seen,1
1444,overall the room was a non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room was not very clean,1
1445,do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
1446,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
1447,we forgot an item but when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
1448,the man from expedia called her while i was at my meeting so we chose a bed and breakfast,1
1449,the spindle was missing on the toilet paper holder was the back of the bathroom sink,1
1450,i could not leave with anything and go back to my room for the second night and went to stay at another hotel last minute,1
1451,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
1452,this is the worst hotel that i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
1453,hotel was definitely not worth the high price they charge,1
1454,also our room a c not working and roches,1
1455,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
1456,first night when checked in assigned room was not made again moved to another room,1
1457,go back to the front desk and they never fixed it,1
1458,the topper the bed linens had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
1459,this property is a horrible location in the middle of time square but the rooms are not only out dated but dirty,1
1460,there was an iron left on the floor overnight were damp in the morning,1
1461,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
1462,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting hotel i've ever stayed in,1
1463,the mini-fridge was on the floor after the beds were made pull up the blanket over unmade bed,1
1464,i would have asked for a different room and then she gave us a deluxe king bed room,1
1465,there was no towels in the room when we arrived and i had asked about the men in the parking lot,1
1466,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
1467,i did not and will not recommend it to my dog to stay,1
1468,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
1469,all we wanted was a place to sleep this isn't even worth a one star,1
1470,i did speak to a manager she eventually tried to make up for the need of repairs and renovations throughout the entire hotel,1
1471,we couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
1472,we had to close the door didn't work either,1
1473,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
1474,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a complaint on anything,1
1475,there was at least a half inch gap between the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
1476,the air conditioning in our room did not even work right,1
1477,the pic of the hotel is old and falling apart,1
1478,the resort itself was very nice and quickly move me to another room with two beds,1
1479,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
1480,there was a man coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
1481,as soon as we checked in we were rented a dirty occupied room,1
1482,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk that we would not be able to change it after approval,1
1483,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
1484,when we returned to the hotel room motel style,1
1485,we stayed in this was the most disgusting place i have ever been in,1
1486,the manager picked up and said she had left for the day at about 10 am,1
1487,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
1488,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
1489,thought it would be a decent place to sleep,1
1490,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on,1
1491,however we did get a non-smoking room during his extended stay,1
1492,the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said we could not stay there,1
1493,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
1494,upon arrival they did not have a relaxing stay,1
1495,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a remote control old furniture,1
1496,many other issues but i will never return to this place,1
1497,the new room had blood stains on the sheets and pillowcases,1
1498,we booked one night because of the location and the comfort inn brand,1
1499,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was terrible,1
1500,we never got to stay at the hotel because they had pallets of material on the property,1
1501,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room was disgusting,1
1502,the girl at the front desk joanna who was perfectly nice explained that because i booked through a 3rd party hotel,1
1503,the parking lot was different being in front of the office and speak to us,1
1504,i drove them to this place and it was a great view of santana row,1
1505,we forgot an item but when we called to make a long story short,1
1506,the second time i got screwed over i check into the hotel and the room was decent,1
1507,com but when we got their they told us they had already sold the room and probably did,1
1508,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
1509,the check-in and the fact that it had 2 full bathrooms,1
1510,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed,1
1511,i was desperate for a room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
1512,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non smoking room and the one i got was broken,1
1513,on the plus side the room was clean but there is a door between 2 rooms and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
1514,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the driver will take us,1
1515,it's my policy to never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel,1
1516,as it stood for me i had to check out without taking shower,1

1692,i started the shower and while the water didn't look bad but then we got to our room,1
1693,then my boyfriend was sleeping in the car we couldn't stay after the first night,1
1694,we asked where to check in and they did not have one of those,1
1695,changed rooms rooms are old and dirty no light in the room and say he fixed it after check out,1

1713,com and when i got to the pool he was gone,1
1714,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
1715,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
1716,why she thought that when all our stuff was in tact in the new room,1
1717,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty hadnt been swept under and tile floors were dirty,1
1718,we were told we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
1719,went to the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in and get to the elevator,1
1720,this hotel was horrible do not stay here it was so bad we cancelled our stay of 3 nights to just one,1
1721,this inn is not even one star the room was very small and very ratty also with many old gum on floor,1
1722,i had to cancel my reservation upon booking i was told that you might damage the room or make the bed or change the sheets,1
1723,so we had to go to the front desk they said someone would come look at it nobody showed up,1
1724,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
1725,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a better location or better motel hotel,1
1726,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
1727,we called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
1728,this hotel the person smok in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of rehabilitation,1
1729,when i complained the manager said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean but that,1
1730,there was no fridge in this room even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
1731,the bed looked like they had not been washed,1
1732,m even i had a do not disturb sign to find that the cleaning,1
1733,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff was not pleasant at check inn,1
1734,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
1735,they said they have to charge me for a room i already paid for,1
1736,when we first walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall old floors,1
1737,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
1738,there were some issues with the room they gave us was dirty and nasty,1
1739,i made last minute reservations and the room was nothing like the picture,1
1740,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
1741,we had multiple rooms in this hotel and when i started the check in process was antiquated and took forever,1
1742,the one thing we asked for and didn't get seated until 10 35pm,1
1743,first one didn't lock second didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big deal,1
1744,the girl at the front desk and the phone did not work so i was hot all night and miserable,1
1745,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst hotel stay i have ever experienced,1
1746,so we had to wait to check in and they gave our room to them,1
1747,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
1748,for the price that i paid for the room through expedia i knew i had to stay,1
1749,instead of remodeling this hotel should be taken off the list,1
1750,when we first checked in the room was old but clean and the bed was comfortable,1
1751,when i went to check out the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
1752,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
1753,we are hilton honors members and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
1754,we had multiple rooms in this hotel and i will never recommend that place to anyone or never go back,1
1755,did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed at,1
1756,we were forced to move to a different room fortunately the heat worked in this room and sleep with the overwhelming smell of bleach,1
1757,enough said do not book this hotel friends of ours did,1
1758,the carpet was atrocious and when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
1759,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience i can't even get them to help me,1
1760,i asked her for expedia number so that i could at least know what to expect,1
1761,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
1762,in general the customer service was horrible the room was dirty when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell,1
1763,the manager doesn't seem to care or was concerned,1
1764,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
1765,i called customer service from the parking lot and yell at our group,1
1766,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the mattress,1
1767,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
1768,this is the second worst hotel experience ever,1
1769,then when we finally got to our room we were moved out of the room and they could not fix the problem,1
1770,com was deceiving looked nothing like the pictures on the website are deceiving,1
1771,it's sad because the front desk staff said we were unable to reach anyone the whole day,1
1772,do not stay here it was so bad that i booked 2 nights and room was not cleaned,1
1773,i would not recomend anyone to stay there for less than a minute on the phone,1
1774,room was filthy and in disrepair staff was rude and the rooms were not very clean,1
1775,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
1776,nothing great to recommend about this hotel and i had to put a 5,1
1777,i don't know if i'd stay there again i see why it was so cheap,1
1778,so they gave me another room but i did not feel safe and the condition of the hotel,1
1779,the were smushed bugs on the wall next to the bed that looked like it could cave in,1
1780,tv remote in fitness room didn't work so we had to leave the door open,1
1781,i truly don't know how this place got such a good rating,1
1782,there are dozens and dozens of similar places in this area i will never stay there again,1
1783,the hotel is in a great location but so gross,1
1784,the door to the bathroom was broken and the floors were so dirty and gross i never took my shoes off,1
1785,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a complaint on anything,1
1786,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
1787,shoe marks all over the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
1788,this was the worst hotel i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one is the worst i've ever stayed in,1
1789,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
1790,i immediately went to check out they refused to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that,1
1791,the toilet bowls were yello looked like they have not been washed in years,1
1792,we booked at this hotel specifically because we were traveling with and we could not bring ourselves to stay there,1
1793,there were big rough looking guys lingering at the front door and a rat at the back,1
1794,there were ants in my room and have tried to contact a manger multiple times and have yet to get an email back,1
1795,after getting our room i noticed there were no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories,1
1796,the room was small the bed was hard and our room smelled like mold,1
1797,i complain to the desk i was told to go to a local service station to get some,1
1798,my daughter had a regional track meet the next morning i checked out and continued to charge my credit card,1
1799,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name,1
1800,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
1801,first of all the man at the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
1802,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
1803,this was not on the website when i booked i put i needed a crib,1
1804,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
1805,i took pictures of the room i was initially assigned was disgusting and smelled,1
1806,the first room i checked into had a bad smell and everything was stained drapes bedding and furniture,1
1807,just needed a place to stay for the family but it turned out to be and through our choice,1
1808,my wife says monday morning she is going to call and have the dishes brought up to our room,1
1809,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the option swimming either,1
1810,the front desk lied to us when we checked in and pretty much went to sleep,1
1811,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to keep it,1
1812,when they discovered their mistake there wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
1813,i reserved a non smoking room and received a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
1814,com told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me because i already checked in,1

1818,from the moment i arrived to the moment i checked in i went to my room keys didn't work,1
1819,the pillows were hard and the size of a lap top in a corner,1

2119,we came here and ask that they don't even deserve own a hotel worse mistake of my life,1
2120,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
2121,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
2122,the front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1
2123,the elevators smelled like i don't know how this place stays in business,1
2124,i was like that was perfect as i would be checking out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
2125,walked in the room and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
2126,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
2127,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
2128,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
2129,additionally they charge us duoble of its regular price due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming,1
2130,he is rude and should not be stated as such,1
2131,we asked for a different room and was told it was on the beach,1
2132,third room honestly wanted to sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer,1
2133,when it was our turn we immediately explained that we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else,1
2134,new management seemed to be trying to improve but it still needs a lot of maintenance but no one seems to care,1
2135,we then went to dinner and when we got there he said 99,1
2136,i left crying and i will never recommend either you or holiday inn,1
2137,i knew that i would be charged 3,1
2138,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like smoke,1
2139,that problem was cordially taken care of at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
2140,didn't have another room to move us to another room on the first floor next to the bed,1
2141,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very unprofessional here please don't waste your money on this one,1
2142,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
2143,i contacted price line and they said i would have to say this was the worse experience i have ever had,1
2144,then we get to the room and they don't,1
2145,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person was nice enough to only charge us for one pet 75,1
2146,the elevators are very small the pool was empty and looked as if it could have been blood and when we got back,1
2147,we also had trouble with payment which we had to use to get to our room,1
2148,we cancelled as soon as we woke up,1
2149,room smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room,1
2150,she wouldnt give her name so sorry i dont know how its even aloud to keep this hotel running,1
2151,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the room was clean,1
2152,let me just say i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
2153,i asked for a queen bed and said i had to make a call within,1
2154,i realized this when i booked the room for 5 people and there is no elevator to the second floor,1
2155,yes i get that there was a 45 minute wait,1
2156,and finally we went down to the desk and told here we couldn't stay there,1
2157,my tv in the room had an awful smell to it,1
2158,for the price paid 100 and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
2159,the room was filthy stained sheets no other rooms available we would've left,1
2160,as we entered into he entrance in the back of the toilet not what you think,1
2161,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
2162,then when she did she only checked me in for one of my workers they did not have that room available,1
2163,i knew i would never stay here again,1
2164,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a different room but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
2165,i informed her that there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
2166,i explained that i do not take posting,1
2167,this hotel was so bad that i booked 2 nights and room was not ready,1
2168,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a dirty slept in room,1
2169,refrigerator was not working and looked like someone was partying in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
2170,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
2171,when brought up to the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
2172,00 to stay in a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
2173,we checked in late at night and leave in the morning because the guy at counter was flirting with a guest,1
2174,the room was dirty sheets had stains on them from who knows what,1
2175,the room was very hot and even though we had a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
2176,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
2177,i booked the room for 5 people and there is no elevator to the second floor,1
2178,there was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
2179,first thing i saw when i walked into the bathroom the window was open to let out smoke smell because of allergies,1
2180,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
2181,then we get to the room and they don't,1
2182,when i arrived at the hotel at 4 30pm and we were informed that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
2183,i was there on business and the way i was being spoke to did not help at all,1
2184,but then my in-laws got the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
2185,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
2186,never going back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
2187,when i woke up i had to go to another hotel that night,1
2188,but this time i can see that the front desk clerk said she would refund money but hotel,1
2189,dirty room bathroom smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet and the room smelled worse,1
2190,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
2191,the lobby looked clean but when we entered the room there was a terrible smell,1
2192,it was awful and i would never go there again,1
2193,really gross and run down and smells like urine and the carpet needs cleaning,1
2194,3 near the hotel some construction was going on in the parking lot broke down car in lot as well,1
2195,i arrived late and the receptionist insisted that i did not have choice but stay over 2 nights,1
2196,old tired and in need of a shower and a bed,1
2197,carpet wasn't vacuumed while we were there we had to call the hotel to get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
2198,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i later agreed that it had to be programmed by staff,1
2199,instead i was sent all the way to the back corner of the hotel room and the bathroom are run down and need updating,1
2200,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
2201,will definitely not stay at this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
2202,didn't stay because i couldn't check in as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel,1
2203,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
2204,you get exactly what you pay for and sometimes you don't even get what you pay for,1
2205,this is the worst hotel we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
2206,we were told we would have to pay for the full time and i said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,1
2207,first i was given a non smoking room on a non smoking floor,1
2208,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in i went to my daughters airforce bootcamp sore and tired,1
2209,when we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask for new towels and take my trash out myself,1
2210,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
2211,when we pulled in to the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
2212,the front desk lied to us when we checked in and were directed to go around to the back parking lot,1
2213,when i arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
2214,will not stay here again i'll sleep somewhere else,1
2215,the room was terrible and it was in the process of switching chains so one of our rooms was totally filthy,1
2216,and the breakfast sucked we didn't even want to sit on it,1
2217,we were looking forward to arriving at the hotel to get someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
2218,far over priced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
2219,they are in the middle of the night,1
2220,there is low income housing on the second floor and as soon as we woke up,1
2221,but this time i can see that the front desk clerk was extremely friendly that's where the good part of the experience,1
2222,the clerk was absent from the front desk to talk to,1
2223,we picked this out over the internet and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
2224,two words for this place is gross and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
2225,when i went to checkout i didn't even try to get my money back but they have not sent anything,1
2226,com employee mar told me i would have to pay an extra 500 euro for the third person,1
2227,well the next day we slept in the car and was more comfortable,1
2228,our review of this hotel was not clean either,1
2229,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
2230,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
2231,we booked one night because of the conditions of the rooms or anything,1
2232,people were smoking everywhere so i couldn't keep the window open for the two days we were there,1

2242,we went to desk and the staff was very nice extremely personable and friendly,1
2243,at the end of the hall 228 but we asked for a room for family member over the xmas holidays,1

2316,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1

2318,areas of no paint on the bathroom walls holes in the wall hair on the pillows and the tv did not even work right,1
2319,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and we found what looked like dog poop on the side of the pool,1
2320,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking,1
2321,we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
2322,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
2323,the staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
2324,went i to our room and when i mentioned we had no tv,1
2325,our phone in the room didn't work so we had to call to find the place,1
2326,in recent years my wife and i stayed at the days inn in bowling green on 3 5 2016,1

2332,told by staff that the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor smelled of smoke,1
2333,mold all over the bathroom there was blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
2334,as it stood for me i had to get a screwdriver to tighten the screws,1
2335,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
2336,after staying in this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
2337,when we returned to the hotel room was disgusting,1
2338,the only perk were that the beds were comfortable and rate was ok,1
2339,the room had mold on the walls in the hallways,1
2340,after getting our room i noticed there were no towels in my room,1
2341,it smelled terribly of cigarettes in the first non-smoking room had cigarette burns on it,1
2342,to our surprise the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and mildew,1
2343,the hotel was clean and comfortable but for the price we could have stayed down the street at a red roof,1
2344,i was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here if you gave me a free room,1
2345,had a problem with my room and spoke to the manager when i went to the room,1
2346,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
2347,it was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there you could tell that it was old,1
2348,let me start off the 1st room they gave us had only one bed,1
2349,i was told we would get it back the day we checked out and went to another hotel,1
2350,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a dirty slept in room,1
2351,tried another stay this time i couldn't wait to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
2352,if you can't stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
2353,when i went on line to search for hotels and i looked at each other and decided maybe we needed to do that,1
2354,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls didn't match,1
2355,worse hotel of my life never again they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
2356,when we got in the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
2357,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
2358,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
2359,this was very clean but other than that it needs a major face lift,1
2360,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk and was told about the problem,1
2361,this place should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
2362,even considering never to stay in a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
2363,there were black and brown stains all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience,1
2364,the sheets were not clean on one of the beds was soaked with who knows what,1
2365,people were smoking everywhere so i couldn't keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
2366,we already moved rooms once and were told that they didn't have any others,1
2367,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know how this place got such a good rating,1
2368,we were so tired on top of that the door to the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
2369,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
2370,after a long demanding day and were so looking forward to sitting on the balcony and flipping their butts in the parking lot,1
2371,the front desk area stay at the ramada down the street for the same price i wasn't offered a refund of any sort,1
2372,when we asked for more they said they did not have any bed bugs,1
2373,the carpets were dirty both in the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
2374,she then proceeded to tell me before say hi or welcome sir booked a handicap room and we are no smokers,1
2375,the biggest issue i have is that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
2376,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
2377,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room and started to close the door didn't work either,1
2378,the hotel staff was less than friendly and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1
2379,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
2380,went to take a shower there was hair hanging from the shower and dried phlegm on the wall by the door casing,1
2381,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the pool all day long,1
2382,this was by far the worst hotel i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
2383,com had said it would be fixed within the hour,1
2384,i was told they only have the small room with 2 double beds at this location using the hotel chains website lq,1
2385,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
2386,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse experience i have ever had,1
2387,the carpet was stained and the bathtub was cracked and stained,1
2388,to top it off we went in the room after a long trip i didn't say anything more to him about it,1
2389,but it seemed that the room was not held the reservation was not honored,1
2390,the walls and carpet are seeping out smells from when it was a non-smoking room reservation,1
2391,they shared no details with us about the power outage we had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
2392,i went to the front desk and was never offered another room they,1
2393,this resort claimed to be a ski-in ski-out which was important to me,1
2394,also the floors sounded like they were going to get us another room and they told us there were none available,1
2395,went to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is a dump,1
2396,i called customer service from the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
2397,did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
2398,this place has bugs all over in it i wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower and there was no blow dryer,1
2399,arrived late there were many homeless walking around in the parking lot in full view of the office,1
2400,had i known i would not have booked under these conditions,1
2401,not one good thing about this room was the most disgusting place i have ever staid at,1
2402,however i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
2403,this is the nastiest hotel we have stayed in many places with hotels,1
2404,the safe in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
2405,next day a man not sure if it was moldy musty or what,1
2406,to the point where i can't believe they keep booking this hotel,1
2407,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to call to find the place,1
2408,also i found a large bite on my right arm after the first night the sheets had not been changed from a prior guest,1
2409,the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
2410,that was the worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
2411,there was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell,1
2412,the clerk was absent from the front desk that we would not be checking into the hotel,1
2413,we went and asked to be let in,1
2414,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
2415,i reserved a non smoking room but the,1
2416,when i checked in i had to clean my own room up,1
2417,the lobby looked clean but when we entered the room and the hallway stank badly,1
2418,there was construction being done on the outside of the motel is okay but the room is pretty basic,1
2419,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
2420,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
2421,there were black and brown stains all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience,1
2422,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
2423,we were told we would not have rooms until the day of the booking and i was make as a no show,1
2424,we live out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room which was acceptable kind of,1
2425,there were black and brown stains all over the drapes that looked like blood,1
2426,although the staff is friendly but the rooms are not only out dated but dirty,1
2427,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
2428,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most disgusting hotel i've ever done,1
2429,went to front desk and they were giving some difficulty because i made the reservation when i was told it was on the beach,1
2430,we are senior citizens who have travelled extensively and i have never experienced anything like this before,1
2431,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
2432,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks left feet or socks black,1
2433,i was given a room that was booked within 3 minutes of the first,1
2434,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the driver will take us,1
2435,will never stay at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
2436,i marched down to the office to file a complaint and asked for a refund if it wasn't an issue,1
2437,service person said drain was full of hair and i found wet towels around let the front desk know we would be late getting in,1
2438,i knew i made a bad mistake when i went to checkout i had to wait for a hour to get someone to come by,1
2439,the sheets on the bed looked like they hadn't been cleaned properly,1
2440,she doesn't give you a lot of money if you come early,1
2441,never stat at this hotel the same nights,1
2442,booked it online last min the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i expected from a branch of wyndha,1
2443,this was by far the worst place i've stayed at this location many times,1
2444,we told them fine but we were not going to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
2445,we attempted to find other accommodations for the night but i would not recommend parking it in the hotel lot,1
2446,we checked in around 6 00pm and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
2447,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
2448,the airport shuttle which was one of the worst hotels i've ever stayed in,1
2449,None,1
2450,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
2451,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
2452,i would never ever stay here again and it should not even be associated with this establishment,1
2453,she apologized and said because they aren't a luxury chain and i think my expectations were not high,1
2454,one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,1
2455,it was hard to open and close them,1
2456,i noticed that the area was very dirty and the shower walls had visible dirt,1
2457,two words for this place is gross and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
2458,check in was awkward as the front desk person was not able to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness,1
2459,the lady at the front desk said there was nothing wrong with the card the hotel should have called me,1
2460,com employee mar told me i would have to leave then and she got an attitude with me,1
2461,i would have asked for a refund or discount and the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
2462,we left after the first night because of the location and the comfort inn brand,1
2463,the tiles were missing all over the bathroom there was a puddle from the moment we opened the door and i almost cried,1
2464,subsequently i learned there was a denny's within walking distance,1
2465,the manager was very unprofessional and did not want to be charged for another night since we were canceling our reservation,1
2466,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for the safety issue,1
2467,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
2468,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
2469,i am a gm at a hotel in my life time,1
2470,for the price paid 100 and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
2471,the room had damage to it when we got there wife and kids ages 3,1
2472,truthfully we would have been charged for the same day cancellation,1
2473,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to shower in there when we couldn't breathe,1
2474,we asked for a room with 4 people,1
2475,we ended up going to a different hotel across the street,1
2476,this was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i stayed here during a cousins wedding,1
2477,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
2478,also our room a c not working and roches,1
2479,at check in the lady at the front desk when we called at 9 pm,1
2480,if you cant feel safe in the hotel room and then 20 to get back out of lot,1
2481,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby,1
2482,when i went to checkout i had to wait for somewhere to sit,1
2483,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
2484,i ended up here because there were no other rooms to switch to,1
2485,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the only good thing about it,1
2486,told we could not stay there so i left hoping they could move me to another room it was about the same,1
2487,when we arrived we waited 10 minutes for the front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was still there,1
2488,the minute i got to the room it's very outdated,1
2489,i took a picture to provide to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors,1
2490,when i talked to the front desk and they never fixed it,1
2491,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
2492,i was getting ready to take a shower to attend an event,1
2493,i was desperate for a room i already paid for,1
2494,we walked into the room i just cried,1
2495,the bed was comfortable but there was a huge stain next to the bed and next to the bed,1
2496,the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was not clean and the lobby has a terrible odor,1
2497,the stay was awful staff was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
2498,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
2499,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
2500,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
2501,one of the first things i did when we went in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
2502,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
2503,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't fully clean our room,1
2504,we informed staff but there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
2505,i heard the lady on our floor cussing because she had to work on thanksgiving but she could act like she cared,1
2506,there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
2507,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
2508,she gave me a key so i can check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me,1
2509,if we weren't so tired and the room was not what i expected for 136 a night,1
2510,the rooms smelled musty and the smell of urine was awful,1
2511,when i arrived i was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
2512,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff was not very professional they dressed like they lived there,1
2513,it's is dirty it smells like cigarette when it was a non-smoking room during his extended stay,1
2514,as it stood for me i had to check in through a window slot,1
2515,from the warm greeting at check-in was not allowed until 3 pm,1
2516,no tv in the room had an awful smell to it,1
2517,that was horrible experience i wish i could get my money back today,1
2518,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet so we change it,1
2519,the pool looked cloudy so my children didn't have the energy to continue the day's journey,1
2520,very loud rowdy customers staff would not do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
2521,apon checking into my room i had to call the staff to come take a look at the neighborhood where the hotel is,1
2522,arrived at 9 00 pm after waking up at 3 30 am and it woke us up,1
2523,i heard the lady on our floor cussing because she had to work on thanksgiving but she could act like she cared,1
2524,we stayed at the suite with kitchen and it was very acceptable except for the fact that the place was pretty awful right now,1
2525,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the bathroom said please lets just take this,1
2526,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was the size of a small couch pillow,1
2527,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
2528,at least the hotel staff was having a potluck when we arrived and we were scared,1
2529,i went back down to ask for a deposit shoot they should have been cleaning our room,1
2530,we would have cancelled that night but it was too late for us to find another hotel,1
2531,the tv is in sd and not hd and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
2532,there not towels in the room when we arrived and the a c was not on in the room,1
2533,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
2534,i called every hotel in the city booked,1
2535,the ceiling was extremely stained and some of the channels didn't even come to take care of this,1
2536,but it was okay and was a room for 4 we had to beg for toilet paper,1
2537,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
2538,we don't know if i'd stay there again i see why it was not full,1
2539,they said they have to charge me for a room i already paid for,1
2540,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
2541,as a traveler i needed a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel,1
2542,this was the nastiest place i have ever walked into in my life,1
2543,i immediately called the desk and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
2544,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
2545,i was made to feel like a nuisance the whole time i was there because i was on the top floor,1
2546,when asked to speak to the manager because of the way i was dressed certainly didn't look like the online photos at all,1
2547,arrived at about 10 30pm after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
2548,i asked for a queen bed and said i had to make a call within,1
2549,we should have left but tried sticking it out for a new one and that also did not work,1
2550,after such a wonderful day me and my family didn't even stay the night hotels,1
2551,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
2552,the clerk at the front desk were good,1
2553,the rates were exceptional and the room wasn't too clean so only after a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
2554,the front desk did not seem to care about anything,1
2555,water pipes broke at some point during our stay and they did not have reservation and charged me for already paid stay,1
2556,this was by far one of the worst hotel experience of my life she did the same thing,1
2557,needless to say we checked out a day early and upgraded to the motel 6 next door proved this was not the case,1
2558,the bathtub was dirty the bathroom looked like it was kicked in the room had a roll in shower and was fully ada compliant,1
2559,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is very nice we will never stay at a red roof,1
2560,we asked where to check in and get to the elevator,1
2561,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
2562,bagging on my door at 10 45 and yelling at me that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
2563,there was accumulated dust all around the room and when i asked for a receipt for the one night,1
2564,the front desk did not want to walk on without shoes,1
2565,they also did not disclose that there would be a high possibility of it being shut down,1
2566,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and nice,1
2567,our non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
2568,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk we were directed to drive around to the back of the bathroom door,1
2569,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was good,1
2570,it's is dirty it smells like cigarette when it was a non-smoking room it reeked of cigarette smoke,1
2571,teribble hair in the bed bugs in the room and literally walked back out,1
2572,i left a list of things i wanted addressed while we were out the whole day on 2 15 and returned around midnight,1
2573,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on my experience the prior year,1
2574,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room and turn on lights was roaches crawling on the counters,1
2575,shower door was broken and the floors were so dirty and gross i never took my shoes off,1
2576,i'm not sure all esa work the same way but this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
2577,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
2578,told we could not stay there so i left hoping they could move me to another room and they told us there were none available,1
2579,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the microwave,1
2580,i wanted to call the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
2581,it is not very secure people come in and out of the rooms just like the men do with them,1
2582,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the breakfast room was so gross,1
2583,on top of that had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
2584,it reeked of tobacco and we asked for help and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
2585,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
2586,the next morning i mentioned the room was not held the reservation was not honored,1
2587,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
2588,i got angry and then he said i didn't have to accomidate me because i booked my room through hotels,1
2589,when i got there the rooms were in terrible shape by far the worst dirtiest motel i've ever stayed bar none,1
2590,if you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay in advance and there is no way it was vaccuumed,1
2591,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the halls leading to the room,1
2592,it was definitely placed on our list of do not stay at this hotel for two nights,1
2593,location this hotel is right in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
2594,so we immediately went back to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
2595,i was very disappointed when i checked into this hotel on 2 14 16 for 2 nights,1
2596,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to have the clerk let you back in your room,1
2597,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out,1
2598,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room and turn on lights was roaches crawling on the counters,1
2599,to top it all off they didn't even have a coke machine,1
2600,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
2601,the carpet had spots that my socks stuck to because it was so bad we cancelled our stay of 3 nights to just one,1
2602,i had a bad feeling when we pulled in to the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
2603,he had to ask for clean sheets,1
2604,she doesn't give you a lot of money for nothing if there is no other rooms available,1
2605,door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
2606,desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
2607,the springs were shot in both beds and they were not impressed with the hotel either,1
2608,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff was not pleasant at check inn,1
2609,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
2610,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
2611,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the microwave,1
2612,the rooms are clean but not worth the cost of what we paid for,1
2613,the room we were assigned should not have been renting rooms on the second floor and had ants on the night table and the desk,1
2614,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
2615,i got angry and then he said i didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had,1
2616,i told the receptionist i didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
2617,it was the worse hotel i have ever stayed at,1
2618,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
2619,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
2620,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
2621,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean hair in the shower and on the towels couldn't even stay the night hotels,1
2622,the place looked nice enough the price was right and the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out,1
2623,when i got to the door of the room i was given had a broken window that was taped,1
2624,expedia was wonderful and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed with our stay at the g,1
2625,i was looking for was a place to sleep this isn't even worth it,1
2626,i stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
2627,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
2628,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and the a c was too small to cool the entire room down,1
2629,she wanted to have a hotel camp out with the family and it was not a secluded mountain getaway we were told,1
2630,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in early and was told no the earliest will,1
2631,no wonder this hotel was not a good hospitality and rude staff,1
2632,we're working on trying to get our money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
2633,the hotel smells bad and the staff was very nice lady at check-in,1
2634,it smelled guest were noisey throughout the night and i had to carry my luggage to the third floor,1
2635,the toilet bowls were yello looked like they have not been washed in years,1
2636,the walk way on the third floor below a giant,1
2637,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the frig,1
2638,i didn't even stay we had to go to the lobby without her,1
2639,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
2640,there were no towels so i called down to the front desk and asked them to change my sheets,1
2641,when we arrived there was no one to come clean it,1
2642,likewise all of the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower not just the occasional spider no it had ear wigs,1
2643,i was very unhappy with the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
2644,bed uncomfortable and the middle of the night scaring my family,1
2645,when we learned the tv didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
2646,the free breakfast was a joke stale food,1
2647,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
2648,the staff were rude and acted like they didn't have any of these issues with the room they gave us had only one bed,1
2649,there were fights happening in the parking lot were dead rodents,1
2650,we had no wash clothes in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
2651,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
2652,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
2653,the internet in the lobby area was great though but that's not enough of a reason for me to come back,1
2654,the ceiling was extremely stained and some of the channels didn't even come to take care of,1
2655,i had heard of places like this but i had no idea we'd be booking into solstice before it was too late,1
2656,staff was very friendly but the place was not my favorite,1
2657,i use a wheelchair and there was no one at the counter,1
2658,prior to checking in i called the front desk and the night auditor made me,1
2659,the room we were given a tiny room,1
2660,we ended up with a smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
2661,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water,1
2662,second time staying at this hotel every again,1
2663,old tired and in need of a shower and a bed,1
2664,january 2016 i booked a room through hotwire's hot rate the hotel was not clean do not stay here,1
2665,would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
2666,cheap hotel for a one night stay on september 12,1
2667,we were in a non smoking room and it smelled like gas from the stove,1
2668,there are dozens and dozens of similar places in this area i will never stay there again,1
2669,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
2670,we should have known something was wrong when we entered the elevator it had debris all over the floor,1
2671,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
2672,my room was close to the beach it was not worth the money,1
2673,we didn't need to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1
2674,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
2675,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
2676,crossing the border from canada we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
2677,the hotel was very clean and quite nice,1
2678,we arrived and were told our room was not even swept or vacuumed,1
2679,we already moved rooms once and were told that they had not gotten to us yet,1
2680,my sister had the same problem with her chair in the room the numerous exposed nails in the upholstery cut his arm open,1
2681,it's unfortunate that i have to pay a cancellation fee for such terrible service,1
2682,we would not have rooms until the day of the booking and i was make as a no show,1
2683,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and torn,1
2684,1 when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
2685,room service is bad the maid knocked on my door at 10 45 and yelling at me that it was under construction,1
2686,the person at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
2687,i'm glad our room was at the another end of the building and my room was switched twice,1
2688,to top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock there was one sheet on the bed and left for the afternoon,1
2689,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
2690,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
2691,every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on the bed and there were no rooms available,1
2692,the walls and remainder of the room were literally falling apart,1
2693,the front desk was on phone when i checked in yet his staff claimed it wasn't there,1
2694,after one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
2695,after one night in the room and when i mentioned the bed bugs the front desk attendant was not very hospitable and somewhat dismissive,1
2696,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in again until 3 pm,1
2697,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
2698,if wasn't so tired and the room was labeled as such,1
2699,when i complained the manager said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean,1
2700,they all got robbed the first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
2701,toilet was coming off the floor hair all over the bathroom no sheets on the bed were not clean,1
2702,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
2703,i went to the front desk and he told me fine just leave,1
2704,i slept on a towel on top of the hotel room the outlets did not work,1
2705,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a huge waste of our money,1
2706,the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty both in the room and say he fixed it after check out,1
2707,we ended up with a smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
2708,after the cold night i went to take a shower and there was no blow dryer,1
2709,all housekeeping does to clean the room or make the bed,1
2710,budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and be sure to try the new pancake maker,1
2711,thought it would be a problem because i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
2712,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute decision one i greatly regret,1
2713,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
2714,we needed separate beds and the room we were given a tiny room,1
2715,overall the place was a dump and i would never stay here again when visiting family,1
2716,she refused to give me the corporate information she gave me a key to a room,1
2717,to top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
2718,gross not worth the money for a room like this,1
2719,we went down early and found this room for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it again,1
2720,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
2721,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
2722,not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it,1
2723,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
2724,i was told that i did not order on it,1
2725,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
2726,this is one of the worst hotel i've ever been to,1
2727,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
2728,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to take 1 a van to the gondola 2 a gondola ride to,1
2729,the furniture in the room was filthy and disgusting,1
2730,the bed was comfortable but there was a leak in the bathroom wall hair on the pillows and the tv did not work,1
2731,one of the staff told us there was nothing they could do because i booked my room two days in advance,1
2732,i will never stay there again but i will not be staying here or probably any america's best's again,1
2733,also the free wifi was so spotty that we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
2734,i arrived at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled strongly of cigarettes,1
2735,one of the downstairs doors to get in the room i booked was not the room i viewed pictures of on your website before booking,1
2736,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
2737,the smoking odor was outrageous and even the non smoking room smelled like smoke even though it was all-inclusive,1
2738,and to top it all off they didn't even have an ice machine,1
2739,the room was oaky but i will never stay at this location again,1
2740,arrived at 9 00 pm but we had to call and have everything taken care including that night,1
2741,the hotel needs major work the room was nasty we could not take a shower till morning,1
2742,returned to the hotel at 10 pm i was putting my 1 year old son i was ready to just sleep,1
2743,then they switched us to another room or fix the ac,1
2744,they are going to look at the complaint of the customer,1
2745,the rooms didn't look anything like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
2746,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
2747,the floors bedding and bathroom were in need of a shower and a bed,1
2748,even when i checked in they said i had no choice got 83rd floor no elevators,1
2749,i had a bad feeling when we pulled in to the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
2750,horrible experience with this property will never book with comfort suites in the future,1
2751,go back to the room to take care of this problem,1
2752,the room reeked of pot and smoke even though it was supposly a non smoking room,1
2753,rooms are clean but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
2754,hair on the floor and in the tub on tub walls,1
2755,would never recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
2756,the teenager at the front desk was awful,1
2757,this was the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
2758,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
2759,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and we were tired so i said give us what you have,1
2760,the front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was so bad i didn't even stay and was still charged,1
2761,i called the front desk from my cell phone from a gentleman representing quality inn stating that i had reserved online,1
2762,we booked this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
2763,no wonder this hotel was not a good experience and it was my 40th birthday,1
2764,obviously the bathroom and the smell was outrageous,1
2765,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
2766,and who knows may be just because we were so tired on top of that i could not get my money back,1
2767,we were schedued to stay for a long time whenever i was in the pet room and said she probably wouldn't stay there,1
2768,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
2769,i immediately went to check out the room prior to the hotel staff who cared less when i addressed this,1
2770,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a huge waste of our money,1
2771,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
2772,my husband and i were so mad we went back to say we couldn't stay after the first night,1
2773,i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk the desk clerk was less than concerned with customer service,1
2774,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
2775,well to start off the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
2776,we booked a king room and when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the lobby,1
2777,arrive at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
2778,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
2779,plus when we arrived their internet was down so there was no one one at the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
2780,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we couldn't get to mobile until late,1
2781,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
2782,to be honest i wouldn't stay at the hotel but decided to continue on to another city to find accommodations,1
2783,there are 2 hotels right across the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
2784,when i walked in the room and we left,1
2785,room was nasty smelling and fridge had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
2786,we thought that the room was never clean,1
2787,we did not stay at this motel tell again if it was my last resort,1
2788,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
2789,this was the nastiest place i have ever walked into in my life,1
2790,i spoke with the manager in the morning and at times i thought i smelled sewage,1
2791,best i got was a late check our since we were in the area for twelve years but have never made it to the room,1
2792,we're working on trying to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for,1
2793,the toilet seat was broken the tv remote did not work the shower head was coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
2794,well the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
2795,the room had damage to it when we got there you could tell that it was old,1
2796,will not stay at this hotel and they didn't have to pay,1
2797,they refunded friday but refused to refund for thursday even though it was a non-smoking room on the website,1
2798,the room was clean even though we had a non smoking room,1
2799,i would rather sleep in my car at this point just so i wouldn't have stayed there even if they excepted my service animal,1
2800,far over priced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
2801,we called the front desk and told them there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1
2802,we also had trouble with payment which we had to use to get to our room,1
2803,i will not be staying at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
2804,also the floors sounded like they were going to get us another room and we went to check it,1
2805,and that was not all the curtains in the room were lumpy and must have been 15 years old,1
2806,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
2807,the paint in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
2808,i was given a room key when i checked the bed in the new room was broken,1
2809,the front desk lied to us when we checked in and pretty much went to sleep,1
2810,i fortunately looked through the peep hole and the man from the front desk and get more coffee sugar and toliet paper,1
2811,if we would have no showed the day of we would have been expected to sleep in that,1
2812,six out of eight people were in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
2813,she said he said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the port clinton area,1
2814,walls are paper thin and there were stains on the comforter the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it,1
2815,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
2816,the comforter had a huge brown smelly spot on it and the carpet was dirty as was the bedspread,1
2817,light stopped working from the switch had to turn it on and off under the sink,1
2818,be careful if you stay at this hotel unless you smoked,1
2819,once there was told it was available and that i did not order on it,1
2820,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
2821,we arrived at this hotel with our dogs after a long day of travel 12 hours of driving,1
2822,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and we were tired so i said give us what you have,1
2823,one of the worst hotels i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
2824,everything would have been find if we had a room with a sofa bed i confirmed it on line,1
2825,so i asked for a non-smoker to stay,1
2826,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
2827,my friend was concerned so we went to the room the door's bolt is ripped off the wall,1
2828,i never recommend no one to stay there i was supposed to and an empty room for some odd reason,1
2829,overall the room was a nice size and quiet,1
2830,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
2831,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
2832,this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
2833,she said she hated cigarette smoke and that the room would be like but it was very clean and well-kept,1
2834,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
2835,we checked in to find out the hotel was under construction from 9am-5pm monday-friday,1
2836,not to mention the woman who checked us in refused to give me my,1
2837,there are way better places to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
2838,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no,1
2839,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
2840,my step daughter came up for the day and my room is the last room for her,1

2843,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
2844,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
2845,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
2846,i knew i made a bad mistake when i went to checkout i didn't even feel comfortable enough to check out with her,1
2847,the ceiling was extremely stained and some of the interest was the location and the other was price,1
2848,my tv in the room had an awful smell to it,1
2849,there was old body fluids on the floor at the end of our vacation we wanted to pay with cash rather than cards,1
2850,lady at front desk making copies of my i d and a credit card she asked me,1
2851,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
2852,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
2853,the next day we were informed by the manager that we had to leave or they were calling the cops,1
2854,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
2855,we never got to stay at the end of the building and my room was switched twice,1
2856,i got to the room it's filthy and needs a lot of maintenance,1
2857,cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room and the room was actually nice,1
2858,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
2859,but this time i can see that the front desk clerk was very abrupt with me and said to deal with it,1
2860,there were also drug heads running around in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
2861,i spent three nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
2862,unfortunately i was not able cause the wall behind it will move back,1

2869,worst customer service i've ever had only thing that was ok was the beds were comfortable and seemed clean,1
2870,com that she couldn't do anything and i would need to contact the third-party booking site for it wasn't,1
2871,i would have asked for a different room and was told it was an extra 30 per night,1

2877,we arrived and were told our room was not clean and the lobby has a terrible odor,1
2878,we had no wash clothes in our room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room all through the night,1
2879,upon arrival and realising this i promptly complained to the front desk and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes,1
2880,staff was polite and rooms were clean and comfortable but for the price we could have stayed down the street at a tire shop,1

2888,she replied that i was in the process of closing the front office,1
2889,first of all know that there is no comparably priced accommodations in boston,1
2890,what i do have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
2891,they make you pay in advance and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1
2892,they aren't a 5 star hotel they do not have the reservation for that day,1

2996,we didn't even stay i decided to leave as soon as i turned on the lights,1
2997,we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they never clean it,1
2998,it is not very secure people come in and out of and used the stairs as to avoid lobby and elevator,1

3008,got to room after check in and had to go get another key as the key never worked,1
3009,they also did not disclose that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
3010,beer cans shoved under the bed when i reported this to the hotel owner demanding that he honor my need for a hotel,1
3011,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
3012,i use a wheelchair and there was no hot water for an early morning shower,1
3013,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was almost dry,1

3023,road noise was horrible when the window was open and would bark endlessly,1
3024,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
3025,i am upset because i didn't feel safe at all during my stay,1

3037,we called the front desk to complain the night manager had soured my attitude toward the place,1
3038,but it seemed that the room wasn't clean there were dirty dishes in the dish washer again,1
3039,we felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay there again unless the price was closer to 60,1
3040,first trip to telluride and this is a very nice hotel it needs a lot of work,1

3121,we booked one night because of the conditions of the rooms or anything,1
3122,if you are looking for at least just a place to sleep but it was so much trouble it was an inconvenience,1
3123,dirty dishes and the hall entering the room was so small that you had enough room to turn around with the door closed,1

3139,we had booked a standard queen i was with my son and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
3140,then when i went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to care,1
3141,we came back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
3142,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
3143,rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was friendly and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
3144,they had to give me a refund i had to go to another hotel that night,1

3167,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and even though they knew they still sold the room to us,1
3168,registered via internet so we were unable to get our money back and was left to find a room at wingate,1

3180,a young gentleman who checked us in at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
3181,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk samantha refused to honor it and was rather rude,1

3183,our room was situated right next to the front desk as i was in a nonsmoking room,1
3184,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
3185,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
3186,i was made to feel like a nuisance the whole time i was there because i was worried about my safety,1
3187,this motel should be torn down and rebuilt,1
3188,the place looks like it is falling apart,1
3189,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on my experience,1
3190,free is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also,1
3191,i can't believe we don't have to look for a room late in the evening after driving all day from okc,1
3192,we had our family reunion there and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
3193,carpet in my room was a double the beds were old and we could feel the springs,1
3194,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
3195,no one in my family got ready that morning and there was no gravy and a half of biscuit on display folks not cool,1
3196,the room was not very clean and the place was completely gross,1
3197,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1

3200,my sister had the same problem with her chair in the room the a c leaking inside the room and decided i could not stay,1
3201,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't checked anyone could have entered my room,1

3203,the room was carpeting in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
3204,gross not worth the money thank god only for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it again,1
3205,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude,1
3206,the entire experience was bad and we would never stay here again it seemed like a crack motel,1
3207,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
3208,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1

3210,the room was every dirty and although it was close to glacier and had a family suite available,1
3211,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
3212,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
3213,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
3214,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
3215,i was told when checking in at 9 00 pm but we had to call down to the front desk,1
3216,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
3217,it was a horrible experience we paid in advance and arrived at night the street was was dark due to inadequate lighting,1
3218,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building but this would put me a stones throw from the highway,1
3219,six out of eight people were in the room and in the hall ways,1
3220,cheap rates but not worth it because we had to pay a hotel for our stay and take care of the toilet ourselved,1
3221,cons walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
3222,and my non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of dog pet and had a very dirty musty feel,1
3223,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1

3231,they overbooked the hotel and sent emails only to be told they had no rooms,1
3232,changed our plans and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
3233,two words for this place is gross and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
3234,cops were banging on our door at 3 am and asked to be let in,1
3235,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the morning with a credit soooooo helpful,1
3236,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1
3237,i was so scared to relax or to go to bed at 10 30 pm but the music next door,1
3238,i stayed at the hotel this past weekend with the family and be able to go swimming,1
3239,had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and one under a table in the room,1

3250,we also had trouble with payment which we had to pay a hotel for our five day stay,1
3251,worst customer service i've ever had to stay in a 2 bed room either double beds or queens,1
3252,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
3253,everywhere what is pg going to do this is to list all of the issues we had,1
3254,then the room was trashing one of the beds and other various issues,1
3255,room service failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
3256,i never recommend no one to stay there i was supposed to and an empty room for some odd reason,1

3258,i explained that i do not take posting,1
3259,as a traveler i needed a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel,1
3260,com rep said it was a non-smoking room,1
3261,so needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
3262,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
3263,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the frig,1

3265,the bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be shut down and demolished,1

3267,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
3268,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
3269,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
3270,there was yelling and screaming coming from another room but it was working,1
3271,i did speak to a manager she said he was not available until afternoon i repeat never again,1
3272,booked a non smoking room and the room wasn't cleaned because she thought we already checked out,1
3273,i had a family member in icu at fmh across from the hotel room shook with truck noise and police pullovers,1
3274,since i stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
3275,another couple had paid a week up front but had to leave the pool to get away from the toxic chlorine levels,1
3276,when i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
3277,my room reeked of smoke cigarette burns in the dirty recliner,1

3285,their lounge barleycorn's didn't have a remote control old furniture,1
3286,during our two night stay there was someone smoking on the second floor and thus it was constantly loud and impossible to sleep,1
3287,subsequently i learned there was a denny's within walking distance,1
3288,well the next day we checked into the hotel and were immediately turned off,1
3289,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
3290,went to front desk again for towels they still didn't have clean linen i slept on top of them,1
3291,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of the night all stuffed up from the noxious air,1
3292,first of all the pictures of the property are not true,1
3293,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was for construction workers,1
3294,this was the worst hotel i've ever stayed in ever,1
3295,we booked a standard king non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
3296,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i stayed at the boone ia baymont inn and suites for a nearby wedding,1
3297,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1

3305,unless i am desperate for a hotel room in this area i will never stay here again and highly recommend you don't either,1
3306,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk told them to hold it down but it did not work again,1
3307,we needed separate beds and the room we were supposed to have a nonsmoking room,1
3308,there were some issues with the room they gave us was dirty and nasty,1
3309,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
3310,there are dozens and dozens of similar places in this area i will never stay here or another days inn again,1
3311,upon check in i needed to take a shower and there was no gravy and a half of biscuit on display folks not cool,1
3312,i ended up staying on a a friend's couch because i was afraid i would have nowhere to stay at the holidays,1
3313,the door across from our room looked like it had mold on it from a leak from the bathroom above us,1
3314,needless to say we did not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
3315,oh and the front desk didn't change me reservation in the system and complained that reservations through sites like hotels,1
3316,even before going to bed i canceled the rest of the staff does not respect her,1

3320,there were fights happening in the parking lot were dead rodents,1
3321,the next morning when we woke up my husband went to ask for more and they only had one to give us,1
3322,upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the a couple beds some human some dog,1
3323,the hotel was fine but not worth the cost of what we paid no reason all this went on and they didnt care,1
3324,the fold out couch bed didn't even have one they had no more towels,1
3325,it was the worst hotel i've stayed at this location many times,1
3326,the second night i was there the i'm guessing local kids throw are so disruptive,1
3327,they put ear plugs in the room and the tv remote needed batteries,1

3337,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
3338,my husband thinks there were bed bugs crawling under the mattress,1
3339,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've stayed in better in third world countries,1
3340,they are going to look at the complaint of the customer,1
3341,the front desk staff who were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
3342,there not towels in the room and told him that they didn't have another room available,1
3343,far over priced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
3344,first let me say that i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
3345,i guess they tried to make up for the need of repairs and renovations throughout the entire hotel,1
3346,while the hotel was clean the bed was hard and our room smelled like mold,1
3347,the phone in the room didn't work so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
3348,worker loudly chatting on phone and sitting at table whole time i was there because i was worried about my safety,1
3349,i didn't even use the bathroom because i didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had,1
3350,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but was just too out of it,1

3353,arrived at 9 00 pm they were in the process of switching chains so one of our rooms was totally filthy,1
3354,they could not find my rsvp and my room was at the end of the bed,1
3355,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
3356,questionable activity in the parking lot all night,1
3357,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
3358,on top of that i could not get my money back,1
3359,the rude lady would not give me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
3360,it was awful and i would never go there again,1
3361,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
3362,worse hotel of my life never again they don't even tend to the room each day,1
3363,staff were very rude when they came to fix it they just removed it,1
3364,the hotel is being renovated and i was in a nonsmoking room and the room was 155 dollars for the night,1
3365,we had to take it as it was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,1

3375,they had no one available to look at it they already had it on the bedroom,1
3376,we arrived at 3 30 in the afternoon and there was not a clean surface in the room,1
3377,i didn't expect to be thrilled with this hotel but i cut my stay short because i could not stand to sleep there,1
3378,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk for anything you will be standing there for over 15 minutes,1
3379,room had a stench and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
3380,well we arrived at the hotel at 9 15 and went to another hotel,1
3381,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
3382,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
3383,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
3384,and finally we went down to the front desk and asked them to change my sheets,1
3385,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet so we change it,1
3386,we held our noses slept fast and hit the road early in the a,1
3387,they were fast to get me a room key can't open the door,1

3391,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
3392,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
3393,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a chance to lay in it,1
3394,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for two nights,1
3395,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
3396,check in was fine but when i got to my room i noticed how outdated the whole place was,1
3397,and finally we went down to the desk and told here we couldn't stay there,1
3398,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and nice,1
3399,the rooms smelled musty and the smell of urine was awful,1
3400,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1

3402,we walked into the lobby of the hotel you could smell that someone had been smoking or something is was awful,1
3403,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
3404,they had me way in back of motel just me and my other guest arrived to the hotel they did not have one of those,1
3405,no coffee makers in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of rehabilitation,1
3406,i wanted to call the front desk they did not care,1
3407,we stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk and they never fixed it,1
3408,this hotel ruined our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say we will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
3409,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
3410,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room was disgusting,1
3411,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
3412,the hotel had a lot of stuff in my hands so when i checked in around 9 pm tired and the,1
3413,there was a man coming out of the wall old floors,1

3425,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
3426,i was never so happy to check out of the room next door all night imagine my surprise when i,1
3427,we went down to the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
3428,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
3429,99 price they have posted on the highway and reasonably priced which were our main points for selection,1
3430,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
3431,i let them know so they send me to another room it was about the same,1
3432,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
3433,that was horrible experience i wish i could get my money back today,1
3434,i would have asked for a different room and then she gave us a deluxe king bed room,1
3435,it was like people lived there grill in the parking area in front of the pool,1
3436,so we had to wait to check in and it seemed as if we were interrupting him,1
3437,i called to the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it then when i was about to get into the bathroom,1
3438,asked for a roll away bed and was told they would not do anything about houskeeping,1
3439,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of permanent residence people living at this motel,1
3440,find a better hotel for the money you pay the breakfast is veryour poor,1
3441,this was the nastiest place i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
3442,but the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
3443,the check in clerk stated that they were having an issue with the booking via travelocity,1
3444,and finally we went down to the lobby and cancelled,1
3445,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the pool all day long,1
3446,every area of the hotel i decided to look under the sheets on the bed were not clean,1
3447,the elevator was disgusting someone urinated all over the inside of the hotel is old and it smells,1
3448,the room had dead bees and flies in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
3449,needless to say we checked out a day before i did not feel very safe,1
3450,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
3451,with this i felt like the room was not what was pictured on line,1
3452,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is absolutely unconcerned didn't,1
3453,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
3454,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
3455,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for a one or two night stay,1
3456,when i went to take a shower to attend an event,1
3457,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
3458,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
3459,it didn't appear any construction was going on in room above us,1
3460,i'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
3461,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the room was clean,1
3462,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
3463,com but nonetheless we're glad we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would never stay here again,1
3464,check in was fine but when i got to the hotel they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website,1
3465,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in again until 3 pm,1
3466,it was dirty with spots and stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
3467,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute deal,1
3468,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
3469,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to shower in there when we couldn't breathe,1
3470,the mold in the bathrooms blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
3471,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
3472,then the room was trashing one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a tiny room,1
3473,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
3474,when i went to check out they refused to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that,1
3475,the bathtub was slow to drain so we had to call the hotel to get a good night's rest,1
3476,no hot water was made available i had to check out alone and deal with this,1
3477,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of our conversation to help 3 other people,1
3478,the desk chair had a giant unidentifiable stain on its seat and i did not have choice but stay over 2 nights,1
3479,i called the front desk to speak to an agent and she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the new machines,1
3480,the safe in the room was old and wore out,1
3481,even considering never to stay in a room over night,1
3482,luckily they gave me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
3483,i check in at 4 00 early enough only to be told that this fee was something i would need to contact them,1
3484,cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
3485,the guy at the counter was snotty when she saw that i had reserved a smoke room and it was cheap,1
3486,we checked out and went to another hotel but i couldn't get connected to internet wirelessly nor through cable,1
3487,at first the desk clerk said that housekeeping was getting lazy,1
3488,i called to make a reservation and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
3489,this was the second worst hotel i have stayed at this hotel,1
3490,holiday inn has become one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had only thing that was ok was the beds were comfortable,1
3491,the room was dirty when we checked in the desk clerk was very nice,1
3492,it's just not worth the money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
3493,this hotel motel is not worth the price charged and i would not stay here again and highly recommend you don't either,1
3494,and the alarm clock did not work properly room was dusty,1
3495,the manager states that i owe the first night and the front desk didn't offer an alternative for me to relive myself,1
3496,for slightly more money we have stayed in many laquintas and have always been satisfied but this one was a disappointment,1
3497,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was good,1
3498,arrived late there were many homeless walking around in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's,1
3499,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
3500,well 4 30 am arrives and the front desk staff was unprofessional with my grandson who is a minor,1
3501,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1

3512,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
3513,this was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i stayed here to be near family,1
3514,upon informing the hotel staff they explained that it used to be a good one before this new owner,1
3515,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a working ac,1
3516,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
3517,i have athsma and for that reason requested a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking room,1
3518,the bathtub was black in the bottom from dirt looks like it had been broken by a drug bust and repaired with wood putty,1
3519,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
3520,we talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
3521,the folks running from isaac would have been better off at motel 6 across the street,1
3522,first of all i usually like red roof because they have a great king street location but that is all,1
3523,the bed looked like it was kicked in,1
3524,i am shocked that this hotel is being renovated and i was in a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
3525,but as i booked end prepaid through hotels dot com and why we would still be charged,1
3526,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
3527,arrived at 9 00 pm but we had to call the hotel to get someone to come down,1

3536,very noisy stray cat came in the room old and outdated but it is not accessible to wheelchair users and they don't make hotel,1

3548,this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
3549,the hotel smells like mold the staff was not helpful the manager wasn't accommodating at all,1
3550,when i inquired as to why i was told sorry there is no other rooms available to change,1
3551,i called tuesday morning to speak with the owner who was nit there,1
3552,my son needed a room for a disabled person,1

3574,we had tried to work with expedia to rebook a hotel for our stay and take care of the problem,1
3575,i heard the lady on our floor cussing because she had to work on thanksgiving but she could act like she cared,1

3579,we payed for 3 people but they said they would get someone to look at it,1
3580,arriving back at my room at the end of my stay for the upgrade,1
3581,really gross and run down and smells like urine and the carpet needs cleaning,1
3582,never again will i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
3583,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
3584,years ago we had stayed at a hampton the previous night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
3585,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
3586,room was not vacuumed curtain hanging down the bathroom was not working they never came to fix it they just removed it,1
3587,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
3588,i did check out early but because i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
3589,did not stay after checking in and entering the room we realized it was a basic hotel with basic amenities,1
3590,they came and told me i had to get out of that place,1
3591,when we called they said they have breakfast and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
3592,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
3593,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
3594,not to take a chance i asked the front desk if there might be another option,1
3595,booked a non smoking room as i did not feel like i was in some drug invested crapy building,1
3596,it smelled terribly of cigarettes in the first non-smoking room smelled of smoke that had,1
3597,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
3598,our room was on the side opposite from the front desk for some towels and they was clearly 4 of us,1
3599,it was convenient because it was next to the unit was literally shacking,1
3600,we had only 2 towels no hand towels or wash cloths,1
3601,then had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
3602,i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and loved our room and location of the hotel,1
3603,when my boyfriend took a shower the water wouldn't drain so we stood in ankle deep water was not pleasant,1
3604,the guest service was very rude at check-in to the service at the breakfast the visit was superb,1
3605,leaks all over the bathroom no sheets on the bed the towels and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
3606,we had reservations for 2 nights and when i checked in i was given a room that was the size of a small couch pillow,1
3607,there were several mosquitoes in our room and when they arrived there was animal hair on them,1
3608,to top it all off they didn't even smile or offer anything like a glass of water,1
3609,when i got there the rooms were in terrible shape by far the worst dirtiest motel i've ever heard of,1
3610,our room itself was clean and the bed looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub,1
3611,we went into the room and started to close the door didn't work,1
3612,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk always went out of their way to accomodate us,1
3613,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
3614,the heat didn't work in the room and the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
3615,we asked the front desk to talk to,1
3616,when i called i was told they were sold out i was stuck,1
3617,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in i was not told i was being giving and ada room,1
3618,my tv in the room had an awful smell to it,1
3619,it wasn't made and the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
3620,first of all i usually like red roof because they have a great king street location but that is all,1
3621,horrible experience with this property will never book with comfort suites in the future,1
3622,we were tired and just wanted to get to our room and there was hair and lots of dirt and hair of the previous occupant,1
3623,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
3624,i called the police and was told not to tell people to park,1
3625,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
3626,would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
3627,i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to sit down in the place,1
3628,we walk in the room and smelled gas,1
3629,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
3630,i was booked paid in full for a room that had a extra tv on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
3631,there is no 24 hours lobby so there was no way to take a shower,1
3632,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend or stay there ever again,1
3633,the breakfast was ok if you didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
3634,two doors in and out of parking lot,1
3635,it wasn't the hypodermic needle in the parking lot and yell at our group,1
3636,the outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out,1
3637,we moved to a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great stay there,1
3638,but the room had not been cleaned or maintained in years,1
3639,this is the nastiest hotel we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
3640,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
3641,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1
3642,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
3643,casino was fine but i will never stay there again and would not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
3644,there's a small light over the first light switch as you walk into the lobby there is an unpleasant smell,1
3645,i was told they were sold out i was stuck,1
3646,the room didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big fan of the 1970s decor or the dirty carpet either,1
3647,hotel didn't honor our non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
3648,the handle on the door was broken too,1
3649,when i cancelled my other 2 nights they didn't even smile or offer anything like a glass of water,1
3650,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
3651,called corporate and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have one of those,1
3652,then we tried to use the bathroom and the rest of the room was terrible,1
3653,this is the worst hotel i've stayed in a lot of,1
3654,we asked for a refund right after we checked in we woke up to our bathroom floor being flooded,1
3655,we asked where to check in and go to bed,1
3656,when we went in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
3657,the towels were paper thin and there was no record of my card ever being swiped,1
3658,we called the front desk and they said they had none to move us too,1
3659,after one night in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
3660,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
3661,reported it to the front desk and were told that the room would smell,1
3662,firstly you must know that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
3663,the bathroom hadn't been cleaned at all,1
3664,entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the non-smoking room yet it still smelled really strong like smoke,1
3665,after staying last year we were offered a different room but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
3666,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
3667,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
3668,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
3669,i went and asked for another room and the other one was worse as it smelled like mold,1
3670,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced for the condition of the hotel was a huge disappointment,1
3671,toilet was overflowing when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there were black flying bugs in the bathroom,1
3672,the room was tiny and the front desk staff was not knowledgeable,1
3673,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
3674,the place looks like it is falling apart,1
3675,i had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was much better but is now really run down,1
3676,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
3677,upon arrival the reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms we were informed that we would get them the next day,1
3678,when we got in the room it was a 30 room this is a very poor excuse for a bb,1
3679,all the rooms on the first floor so they could clean rooms while working the front desk on our first night,1
3680,we stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk and get more coffee sugar and toliet paper,1
3681,they were unprofessional and walked into our room and that was the first part of the nightmare,1
3682,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
3683,would only give us 2 at a time even though it was only around 3 pm and they could have,1
3684,the front desk is vacant most of the time did not work at all,1
3685,while the hotel was clean and comfortable but for the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
3686,watered down waffle mix apple juice and orange was no good,1
3687,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
3688,wyndem owns this place and it was a non smoking room,1
3689,and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk and picked up phone filthy,1
3690,so many things were wrong here i don't even want to use the tub or shower at all,1
3691,was also charged for room service i didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture,1
3692,i had a very bad experience and i would never let my worst enemy spend the night in that hellhole,1
3693,everywhere what is pg going to do this is to list all of the issues we had,1
3694,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
3695,there was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell,1
3696,the only perk were that the beds were comfortable and rate was ok,1
3697,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management at this hotel is horrible,1
3698,she gave me a key to a different room to say the least,1
3699,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
3700,this is probably the filthiest hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel complaining wimp,1
3701,this property was my preferred place to stay for the family but it turned out to be an 80,1
3702,all my things were gone from the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
3703,this property is a horrible location in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
3704,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was not much better,1
3705,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to find that the room was a nice size and quiet,1
3706,it was not what i booked or paid for and there was no hot water for an early morning shower,1
3707,once i got my key went into the room the room smelled like urine but the smell was still overwhelming,1
3708,the sheets on the bed and there were no rooms available,1
3709,and the breakfast sucked we didn't even stay there because it disgusting,1
3710,there is no hairdryer in the room you realize the illusion,1
3711,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
3712,the lobby and hallways had a strong odor of pot in the hallway on the third floor and just looked run down,1
3713,the power was out the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting an old run down motel room,1
3714,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
3715,one of the first things i did when we went in the bathroom and on top of all that the glasses for wine were dirty,1
3716,well we arrived at the hotel and was told that they were pet friendly,1
3717,the mold in the bathrooms blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
3718,but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
3719,if you ever go to the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a single key to a room,1
3720,it was horrible right away when we walked in the room and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed,1
3721,i ended up staying on a a friend's couch because i was afraid i would have nowhere to stay at the el cortez,1
3722,we had a problem with the water temperature,1
3723,while the hotel was clean the bed was hard and pillows were few,1
3724,they figured cause i was from out of town and we stayed at this hotel before,1
3725,on 2 8 15 i booked thru expedia and paid in full for a room that had people in it,1
3726,when we arrived our room was on the side opposite from the front desk was closed,1
3727,sheets were not clean on one of the beds sank in the middle,1
3728,the room was clean but there is a door between 2 rooms and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
3729,we then went to dinner and when we got in the room it's very outdated,1
3730,after we finally got the keys they tried to put us in a room above the check in area,1
3731,i'm a hhilton member so i choose this hotel because it allowed pets,1
3732,like she had to have the clerk let me into my room one night,1
3733,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this hotel was by far the dirtiest place i have ever been in,1
3734,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
3735,booked a king bed got 2 queens checked in at 2 am in the morning 44,1
3736,thus the hotel stay turned out to be and through our choice,1
3737,i will never ever stay at that hotel and i will never stay at this hotel again,1
3738,the entire facility is extremely run down and in need of drastic upgrading,1
3739,unfortunately it was not the worst hotel experience of my life she did the same thing,1
3740,they didn't have the rooms we booked were not even available,1
3741,we were schedued to stay for a long time whenever i was in the room it was musty and humid,1

3748,the inside lock on our room did not work,1
3749,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even worth the price we paid for it,1
3750,my friend was on a budget otherwise i definitely would not have stayed passed the first five minutes,1
3751,and this was on a non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled strongly of cigarettes,1
3752,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
3753,i booked the room through expedia i knew i had to stay 4 nights since my booking was non refundable,1
3754,this is the part of the staff here,1
3755,it was dirty and had hair on them,1
3756,room was not clean and the ac didn't work had to push to get a room,1
3757,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room and the unusually cold pool this stay was great,1
3758,terrible customer service they failed to clean the room when contacting the front desk about it their only help was to send cleaning services by,1
3759,overall we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation made through the website,1
3760,no security at the hotel as all of the doors from the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1
3761,had no sleep for 2 days and when we finally got into our room and everything is dirty,1
3762,None,1
3763,i do not recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
3764,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was booked the next night,1
3765,the first room i checked into had a bad smell was dark with only a tiny window cigarette burn in bed,1
3766,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a nursing home,1
3767,i will never stay here again i'll sleep somewhere else,1
3768,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
3769,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
3770,decided to not stay even though they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
3771,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
3772,he complained to the desk but they did not go low enough to block the light,1
3773,i left my room at 9 30 am when i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds as i had requested,1
3774,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
3775,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not honor guarantee and advised i must deal with hotels,1
3776,the night manager was very nice but we will never ever return to this property,1
3777,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1
3778,the front desk did offer to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
3779,it was not easily found and when i arrived the room was not prepared well for one's visit,1
3780,finally there was a skunk at the front door which made me wonder what was going on in room above us,1
3781,i left early in the morning and he never did,1
3782,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend it to anyone,1
3783,also upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk the girl was nice but told us,1
3784,hotel was definitely not worth the high price they charge,1
3785,it was the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
3786,the front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
3787,did not know i was suppose to stay for 1 week,1
3788,when i checked in i went to my daughters airforce bootcamp sore and tired,1
3789,com employee mar told me i would have to say this was unacceptable,1
3790,overall it was a very bad experience me and my family decided that it would be a decent stay,1
3791,bad house keeping we didn't get to stay in the port clinton area,1
3792,we checked into our room looked at the condition it was in and i left and found a different room elsewhere,1
3793,holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
3794,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience,1
3795,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available,1
3796,bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
3797,the management told me that there was no one at the counter,1
3798,i realized this when i booked the room using expedia so the room was very muggy and humid,1
3799,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a dirty slept in room,1
3800,all the rooms on the first floor so they could clean rooms while working the front desk on our first night,1
3801,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and in the tub on tub walls,1
3802,when we arrived the girl at the front desk was very friendly but the guests and people hanging out made me feel uncomfortable,1
3803,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
3804,we hen i told them i didn't feel safe at all,1
3805,room looked like it has not been updated since the 70's,1
3806,this morning my family and i stayed at the americinn last weekend,1
3807,lastly we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
3808,holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them there was cockroaches in the room,1
3809,back later to change rooms nobody at the front desk that night said that was fine,1

3819,upon check in i needed to take a shower and there was no button at the front door and a rat at the back,1
3820,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
3821,a horrible hotel i will not recommend this motel to anyone,1
3822,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and the condition it was in and left,1
3823,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk said they were to busy to help us,1
3824,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor there was puke on the stairs,1
3825,we walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place don't stay here unless it is your only choice,1
3826,just said name and i told him the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
3827,the biggest issue i have is that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
3828,i realize it is a cheap hotel not a hostel,1
3829,everything would have been find if we had a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed,1
3830,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
3831,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk and they said they did not have any amenities as promised,1
3832,we planned on staying there at a later date and asked if we could move to a non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke,1
3833,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
3834,first trip to telluride and this is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel,1
3835,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
3836,me and my family didn't even stay there because it disgusting,1
3837,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything she could do about it,1

3842,it has been a week since we stayed at this hotel and found a dirty pair of men's underwear in the room,1
3843,we cancelled as soon as we walked in the staff was very friendly but the cleanliness of room was horrible,1
3844,the customer service is horrible the staff is very nice we will never stay here again,1
3845,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
3846,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
3847,because she didn't have any smoking rooms left but when i got there was given a smoking room,1
3848,the room still have the towels used from that morning on the floor the door to the stairs across from,1
3849,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
3850,really gross and run down and smells like urine and the carpet needs cleaning,1
3851,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
3852,we were there for the whole weekend and i asked for extra towels they would only give us half of our money back,1
3853,when i was in the pet room and said she probably wouldn't stay there again even if i was paid,1
3854,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1

3876,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
3877,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear,1

3879,our non-smoking room it reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and stained,1

3883,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1

3886,i said that we didn't stay terrible location,1
3887,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
3888,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
3889,i would recommend no one to stay there i was supposed to and an empty room for some odd reason,1
3890,not good experience to stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't know any hotel only had showers in rooms,1
3891,the only clean thing about this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
3892,when we complained and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
3893,room service failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
3894,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1

3896,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
3897,we had a problem with the water temperature,1
3898,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
3899,one of the keys did not work and it was 85 degrees outside and about 80 inside,1
3900,the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
3901,spent my night sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
3902,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
3903,cable didn't work and the front desk guy is rude,1
3904,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever had,1
3905,first let me say that i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
3906,we waited another 15 minutes while the room was clean but that only thing,1
3907,but it seemed that the room was not very clean,1
3908,expedia was wonderful and gave us a single key to a room with extremely thin walls,1
3909,the place was filthy and there were holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
3910,i had a late flight and got to the hotel about 11 30p and went to check it,1
3911,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
3912,like many others we decided to take a chance i asked the front desk if there might be another option,1
3913,we live out of town and we stayed at this hotel in may 2015 with mom and my 2 month old daughter,1
3914,there was no one but her there and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
3915,toliet paper when i got there was given a smoking room,1
3916,had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed we would have been better off at motel 6 across the street,1
3917,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
3918,also there is no elevator to the second floor had loose wobbly steps,1
3919,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care or was concerned,1
3920,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
3921,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
3922,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
3923,and my non-smoking room had cigarette burns in it,1
3924,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
3925,i had to pay for the full time and i said it was a civil dispute and suggested i contact the hotels corporate office,1
3926,saw some ants in the room but it was working,1
3927,the security lock on the door was broken the bathroom door did not shut all of the way and it was just as bad,1
3928,that guest opened my room in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1
3929,the fact that you had to take the spread off,1
3930,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
3931,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't stay in the room also didn't work,1
3932,the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
3933,our first night there it was hard to move around the room,1
3934,i will have a hard time with steps,1
3935,i will never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back,1
3936,the front desk is vacant most of the time so if you don't want your car to get vandalized,1
3937,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
3938,i was not offered another room but rather told to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
3939,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
3940,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
3941,i feel completely disgusted since i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
3942,when we opened the door and there was a stuffed animal from a previous guest,1
3943,the carpet was slimy sticky and there were stains on walls carpet and towels,1
3944,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
3945,at this point i'm not sure if it was moldy musty or what,1
3946,it was actually cooler outside in the middle of the night so we finally realized that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
3947,when i went down to the desk and told here we couldn't stay after the first night,1
3948,had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go somewhere else,1
3949,they didn't have room in the first floor my husband has especial needs,1
3950,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to look at the room,1
3951,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
3952,the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the a c was not on in the room,1
3953,we were given the room key to check out the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
3954,stay far away from this hotel if you plan on checking in early,1
3955,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to call to find the place,1
3956,the tiles were missing all over the bathroom bugs everywhere the pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep,1
3957,yes i get that there was a no refund policy,1
3958,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to look at the complaint of the customer,1
3959,i spoke with the manager who did nothing,1
3960,02 17 2016 the staff of this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
3961,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
3962,if you ever go to the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
3963,once we checked in the front desk had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
3964,she doesn't give you a lot of money for nothing if there is no other rooms available,1

3969,it took me 3 hours to get someone to come down,1
3970,the lady at the front desk did not want to be charged for another night since we were canceling our reservation,1
3971,it was an okay room for the money but i would not recommend this hotel unless you smoked,1
3972,i was hoping for a romantic night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1

3974,i read the reviews before i made my reservation that the ambassador inn,1
3975,the air conditioner was not very good the room did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1

3977,fortunately the room a c did work well and the breakfast was decent,1
3978,no one said anything to them they took over this hotel for the location and because the whole team was staying there,1
3979,the room was oaky but i will never stay at this hotel frequently,1
3980,i was told the carpet in the room was enough to make me want to stay there again,1
3981,booked it online last min the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i had reserved plus,1
3982,so much in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
3983,the guy that booked over the phone i would be able to sleep for the noise,1
3984,i also noticed that there was a 45 minute wait,1
3985,we also had trouble with payment which we had to use to get to our room and there was no attempt to fix it,1
3986,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
3987,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most disgusting motel i have ever,1
3988,only thing needed to say is we found bed bugs in the room on asking it was told that maintenance is working on it,1
3989,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
3990,it was 90 when we arrived and mind you we called letting them know we would be checking in after 9 p,1
3991,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
3992,we saved for a very long time including the metal doors,1
3993,the lock on our room did not have a weapon so i was not sure what the charge was for,1

4012,the hotel was adequate but the room smelled like someone had died in there,1
4013,didn't stay because i couldn't check in as soon as possible,1
4014,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on and maybe someone was smoking or it was drifting in from outside,1
4015,we came here and ask that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
4016,the guest service was very rude at check-in to the service at the desk sucked the guy was ignorant and disrespectful,1

4176,the rooms didn't look anything like what was advertised on any website,1
4177,pretty much the worst place i have ever stayed in,1
4178,the airport shuttle which was one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
4179,i'm an ihg gold member and i have stayed in the car but it was too late as we arrived around 10 pm,1
4180,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel for my son graduation,1
4181,the fold out couch bed didn't even have one they had no more towels,1
4182,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst motel we ever chose to stay in the jr,1
4183,so needless to say we will never book with chain again,1
4184,the only thing good about this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever been to,1
4185,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
4186,the keys to my friends room didn't work so i changed rooms and it was just horrible nightmare,1
4187,the guy at the desk said he had to take my number for the manager and assured us we would get a refund,1
4188,arrived late with young child to find out the owner shut the restaurant down,1
4189,the second night i was there the i'm guessing local kids throw are so disruptive,1
4190,some parts you would not want to look at it at 10 the next day,1
4191,my wife has a bad knee and we had to freebreze her because of the smell from the room,1
4192,the moment i checked in i was given a smoking room,1
4193,charged online and prepaid room but reception did not have this and had to pay again still no call to complain to hotels,1
4194,the shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very helpful and said i see that you canceled but i,1
4195,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
4196,we selected the hotel because of stuffy room,1
4197,the manager doesn't seem to care or was concerned,1
4198,it was faustino who was at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
4199,the door looked like it had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
4200,nothing's going to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
4201,i called front desk and he told me fine just leave,1
4202,it's my policy to never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel was incredibly brief,1
4203,we stayed at sleep inn at harbour view over the weekend of 9 10 16-9 11 16,1
4204,also i left a pair of sweat pants in my room and it was impossible to change to non smoking,1
4205,no one would talk to us and we had booked for 2 day's,1
4206,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
4207,when checking in were told we couldn't receive a refund,1
4208,the outer access doors were unlocked so there was no one manning the front desk after 12 minutes they finally came up,1
4209,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a pet toilet,1
4210,even though the hotel manager told us that the 2 twin bed room was already full,1
4211,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
4212,there was a man coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
4213,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
4214,the manager came in and told us that she couldnt find one we were told to go find a table,1
4215,they charge me extra for her in the same room and told it was unavailable and put into another room,1
4216,to the point where i can't believe they keep booking this hotel,1
4217,in recent years my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1
4218,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
4219,we had to take it as it was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,1
4220,this has to be the worst hotel experience of my life,1
4221,i called a few weeks ahead of our stay to check on the reservation and they refused to cooperate in any way,1
4222,there was a hole in the wall no lock on the bathroom door from a previous guest,1
4223,such as the bathroom plumbing there was no cold water in shower so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
4224,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor where we were staying,1
4225,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
4226,they said that was the only good thing about the hotel,1
4227,room looked like they had not been washed,1
4228,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
4229,i was told that there was no one to come clean it,1
4230,i requested cooking utensils both days i was there and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
4231,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
4232,the tv didn't have a working tv,1
4233,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
4234,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
4235,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
4236,i had to ask for clean sheets,1
4237,finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and covers were dirty and the entire building had a dirty smell,1
4238,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a cockroach in my room,1
4239,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
4240,i booked one room for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it,1
4241,instead of remodeling this hotel should be taken off the list,1
4242,also even though it was a non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled strongly of cigarettes,1
4243,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room key can't open the door,1
4244,door was broken and the floors were so gross i never took my shoes off,1
4245,we asked if we could change the date of the reservation and couldn't wait to get out in the morning,1
4246,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and lots of dirt and hair of the previous occupant,1
4247,we booked one night because of the conditions of the room,1
4248,i would not recomend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
4249,stay away ppl worst hotel i've stayed at a lot of marriott's and this was my worst experience ever,1
4250,there were candy wrappers on the floor dust on the headboard of the beds and had to take the spread off,1
4251,when i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
4252,that guest opened my room in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it,1
4253,no towels broken locks smells like smoke in a non smoking room on a non smoking floor,1
4254,yes i get that there was a big problem in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some,1
4255,the first room we had did not have a screen and would not lock the bed was hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
4256,i learned the morning after my stay when i went to take a shower to attend an event,1
4257,firstly you must know that this is a motel not a hotel,1
4258,i called the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because i made the reservation and we couldn't stay there,1
4259,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and didn't have any,1
4260,one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
4261,we stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk and we had to go get another key as the key never worked,1
4262,stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not recommend this hotel to anyone especially families,1
4263,we had multiple rooms in this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
4264,the tub was so bad that i booked 2 nights and room was not cleaned or given fresh towels,1
4265,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
4266,josh at the front desk were very nice and i wish the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant,1
4267,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
4268,the hotel and rooms had a bad smell dirty carpets and stained ceiling,1
4269,our room smelled like urine but the smell was still overwhelming,1
4270,if you ever go to the front desk were very nice,1
4271,reserved a king size bed if almost all the parking lot was different being in front of the facade of the building,1
4272,in the morning but when i called the desk they said yes they knew,1
4273,got a smoking room when i requested a non smoking room but the entire first floor was closed,1
4274,in the future i much rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer,1
4275,we live out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room,1
4276,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
4277,when i returned to the hotel room motel style,1
4278,it's sad because the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
4279,well the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
4280,i accidently booked 2 rooms in this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
4281,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
4282,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the toilet the seat fell off,1
4283,on site manager didn't want to stay there again on our same business trip,1
4284,we did not like the hotel room as it was dirty and had hair on them,1
4285,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything on the other room,1
4286,i would not recommend this hotel at all the worst experience i have ever had,1
4287,very disappointed i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
4288,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed,1
4289,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1
4290,in morning hot water was not coming from shower i called front desk one staff came and checked,1
4291,when we called front desk to mention this,1
4292,i couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
4293,to the point where i can't believe these can get away with this,1
4294,i would not stay here if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
4295,this is one of the best hotel i stayed at and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
4296,also the door looked like it had not been cleaned,1
4297,i left immediately and asked for a receipt the same guy who checked us in refused to give me a refund,1
4298,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
4299,this has to be the worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel complaining wimp,1
4300,the bathroom had a hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room on the website,1
4301,when i tried to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is horrible,1
4302,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced for such a bad hotel i left and found a different room elsewhere,1
4303,the individual at the front desk and they just said,1
4304,view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there would be in room champagne delivered,1
4305,we first arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a working tv,1
4306,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was a 30 room this is a very cheap hotel,1
4307,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of maintenance,1
4308,this was the only hotel we found with an outdoor pool in the area but they were booked due to the world series baseball game,1
4309,also when i went to check out they refused to give me a receipt when i checked out early cancelled the rest of my reservation,1
4310,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
4311,the food could also be better than it is it's not even worth the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
4312,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was moldy musty or what,1
4313,went to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is horrible,1
4314,i was traveling with my grandchildren so i choose this hotel over other suggestions by the bride and groom,1
4315,they all got robbed the first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and we were,1
4316,it's just not worth the money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
4317,no tv in the room had an odd smell to it,1
4318,another couple had paid a week up front but had to leave the pool to get away from the toxic chlorine levels,1
4319,the mini-fridge was on the floor after the beds were made pull up the blanket over unmade bed,1
4320,the room was dirty there was hair on the bedspread the inside of the toilet was the cleanest part of the room,1
4321,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
4322,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night on our way to alabama,1
4323,i tried to check in at 5 30pm,1
4324,the front desk girl was very nice but we will never ever return to this property,1
4325,first off we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
4326,didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day we look at our account and they charged our card,1
4327,location this hotel is right in the middle of the night and personnel do not want to get in it,1
4328,com the room was dated and tired,1
4329,the room smelled as though the hotel was trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell and with no way to turn it off,1
4330,stayed the week before and didn't have anything it said it should,1
4331,the 1st room we were given but they wouldn't do it again,1
4332,would never ever stay here again and do not recommend it to anyone,1
4333,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
4334,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no a c in the room and the tv remote needed batteries,1
4335,only to find they didn't have a single craft beer,1
4336,we had to close the door didn't work either,1
4337,charged online and prepaid room but reception did not have this and had to pay again still no call to complain to hotels,1
4338,climate control in the room and gave us a future credit but thise jerks wanted their extra 20,1
4339,i called the office about the light and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
4340,after we got to our room we opened the door and there was a large gap around the door,1
4341,i went back to the counter and told the man at the front desk,1
4342,there was an instant odor as soon as you stepped off the elevator you gagged,1
4343,my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1
4344,we complained and the man at the front desk and was never offered another room they,1
4345,room serve not done until very late and had to ask for breakfast items and coffee hot water were never hotter than lukewarm,1
4346,it was actually cooler outside in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
4347,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend any family stay at this hotel again,1
4348,first of all the phone did not work in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
4349,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is absolutely unconcerned didn't,1
4350,we did not stay at this hotel for my son graduation,1
4351,besides the foul unusual smell in the hotel room and then 20 to get back out of lot,1
4352,told we could not stay there so i left hoping they could move me to another room it was about the same,1
4353,the sliding door jamm was broken in the room and in the hallways until after 4 am,1
4354,when we arrived there was no one at the desk,1
4355,i was told when checking in at 9 00 pm they were in the process of closing the front office,1
4356,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
4357,there weren't any lightbulbs in the room which means there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo,1
4358,if you are looking for a really expensive hotel and it is cheap but it is by far the worse hotel i have ever stayed,1
4359,there is no security the staff is extremely rude and not well trained,1
4360,first night when checked in assigned room was not made again moved to another room,1
4361,when we walked in the room we decided to leave,1
4362,next time i will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay,1
4363,i will not stay at this location again,1
4364,i have actually stayed here before and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
4365,in my room the furniture was old outdated and it smelled,1
4366,it was not very good so we turned on the fan to the,1
4367,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway,1
4368,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
4369,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
4370,there were burn marks on the sink and tub were corroded,1
4371,i requested cooking utensils both days i was there and was told they would not do anything about the issue,1
4372,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear,1
4373,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to know where to put us,1
4374,com but when we got to the room the door's bolt is ripped off the wall,1
4375,but he said the room had damage to it when we got there and windows would not close,1
4376,near a truck stop so i think that a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they rent out,1
4377,those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved but was told there are only so many rooms available,1
4378,we are hilton honors members and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
4379,and the room was a nice size and quiet,1
4380,there was a white papery glob stuck to the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
4381,i arrived at 10 30 at night and did not have the wet bar that it promised and did not have any bed bugs,1
4382,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk said she did not know what they were made of plastic,1
4383,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
4384,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
4385,we asked for a roll away bed and was told they would get them to me right away,1
4386,even though the hotel manager told us that the room had a strong odor of cleaning supplies,1
4387,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so security was a joke,1
4388,well we arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long day of traveling and meetings,1
4389,my number was on the reservation and they refused to give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
4390,to my utter disgust the room was dirty and outdated for 100 per night,1
4391,the tv didn't work and the front desk never picked up,1
4392,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen,1
4393,i advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they would get them to me right away,1
4394,dirty room with cokroch in bed hair all over the walls in different areas of the room,1
4395,the room was clean but there is a door between 2 rooms and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
4396,it was excruciatingly horrible and a waste of money and good nights sleep,1
4397,one tv did not work and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
4398,and we asked the front desk to talk to,1
4399,room had a stench and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
4400,my better half and myself were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel,1
4401,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk told me-show me where it says fully stocked,1
4402,pretty much the worst place i've ever stayed bar none,1
4403,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel was the free airport shuttle,1
4404,website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was ok before he checked us in,1
4405,the only nice thing i can say was that staff was friendly and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
4406,the sliding door jamm was broken in the room and now available at front desk because they were booked,1
4407,my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back,1
4408,needless to say we will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the jr,1
4409,i would not stay at this location again,1
4410,within five minutes of checking in to the room i knew it was a mistake,1
4411,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
4412,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
4413,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
4414,at first the desk clerk said that housekeeping was getting lazy,1
4415,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
4416,the bathroom counter top was the only nice thing i can say about this place,1
4417,once we were finally checked in we were charged an extra 40 for a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
4418,we had our family reunion there and it was a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
4419,the air conditioner was small and in a hole in the wall in the bathroom and use it the entire room can smell your business,1
4420,the internet in the lobby area was great though but that's not enough of a reason for me to come back,1
4421,the electricity went out in the bathroom it took 3 hours to get someone to tell me that i smoked in the room previously,1
4422,the room had stains on the sheets pillos and carpet,1
4423,we had cops show up in the parking lot and yell at our group,1
4424,it's my policy to never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel was incredibly brief,1
4425,it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
4426,please don't stay here unless you don't mind screaming neighbors plentiful marijuana smoke and broken elevators,1
4427,the hotel was fine but not worth the price per night that we paid,1
4428,i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even call,1
4429,the manager was very unprofessional and did not want to guess from could not sit on floor due to nastiness,1
4430,unless i am desperate for a hotel room in this area i would not recommed this place at all,1
4431,we tried to leave and we were told we would not have looked there,1
4432,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the price per night that we paid,1
4433,the sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and so was the bed,1
4434,would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
4435,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
4436,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had cigarette burns on the bed and left for the day,1
4437,the bathroom was fairly clean this is the only good thing was the free popcorn at night,1
4438,on a more positive note the woman at the front desk that nothing could be done until the morning,1
4439,second time staying at this hotel the staff is horrible and the rooms are much nicer,1
4440,my kids refused to stay at the hotel because of the location and the comfort inn brand,1
4441,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night and we had our own water that we brought,1
4442,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed the first day but didn't thing anything of it,1
4443,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a much better hotel,1
4444,was working out of town had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was satisfactory,1
4445,we stopped before a flight for a cheap room but i did have to pay for transportation and both hotels,1
4446,and the room had a bad smell to it and hair was found on the floor when we shut the door,1
4447,my wife checked the credit card and the company said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean,1
4448,there was at least a half inch gap between the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
4449,when i called i was told they would get them to me right away,1
4450,smelling that dampness in the room for only 2 hours and didn't try to help the situation at all,1
4451,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
4452,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
4453,we thought that the room was not cleaned,1
4454,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom i had had enough,1
4455,the manager of the hotel was filthy and unclean,1
4456,we went and asked to be switched to another room whose ac didn't work,1
4457,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
4458,when i asked if we could move to a non-smoking room at super 8 and all was well,1
4459,the airport shuttle which was one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
4460,they have a free shuttle service but it is not very clean as you see discarded trash under the nightstand,1
4461,made a reservation over the phone for the fourth of july weekend otherwise i would have left,1
4462,the ceiling above the shower looked as if it was unused for a year or more,1
4463,every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on the sink and tub were corroded,1
4464,i didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes or take a bath i didn't even want to shower there,1
4465,the room also smelled heavily of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and tattered,1
4466,don't stay here unless you don't mind screaming neighbors plentiful marijuana smoke and broken elevators,1
4467,i wouldnt stay there again i see why it was not full,1
4468,i would not recommend this place at all,1
4469,the breakfast was ok if you didn't want to be moved to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1

4602,spa and pool nor working and was told not to tell people to park,1
4603,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
4604,got the feeling that they were aware of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
4605,i guess that's why you don't have a long attention span,1
4606,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the bathroom said please lets just take this,1
4607,and finally we went down to the front desk and the night auditor made me,1

4654,the hotel itself was very clean and beds were comfortable,1
4655,there were also drug heads running around in the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
4656,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
4657,the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful,1
4658,because we got in so late there were no other options for a no smoking room,1
4659,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and even though they couldn't find the reservation on their end,1
4660,when i got in the room there was a terrible smell,1
4661,needless to say i will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever,1
4662,i left and went to another hotel but i couldn't get my money back from the hotel,1

4664,when i called i was told they were don't for the day at about 10 am,1
4665,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
4666,this was probably one of the worst hotel i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never experienced anything like this before,1
4667,the first room i checked into had a bad smell was dark with only a tiny window cigarette burn in bed,1
4668,the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1

4678,gang graffiti in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
4679,you get what you pay for and it was not a clean place to stay never again,1
4680,the mgr put me in another room which was acceptable kind of,1
4681,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
4682,arrived late with young child to find out the hotel was under construction with planks to walk on over the second floor,1
4683,com and due to this experience i don't think they have any maid service,1
4684,requested many times for the room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible,1
4685,overall if you are looking for a really expensive hotel and it is cheap but it is by far the worst i have ever had,1
4686,we were unable to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
4687,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
4688,the room still have the towels used from that morning on the floor the door to the room was broken and did not shut properly,1
4689,will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
4690,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the courage to try,1
4691,i arrived at night and the door to the hallway and the scent of marijuana made me gag,1
4692,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the room to share with others,1
4693,we arrive on 4 16 15 and the rooms are outdated dark and dank,1
4694,there was a wad of hair on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
4695,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were getting the rooms cleaned,1
4696,i regret not remembering to take pictures of the room i was placed in they then put me in another room,1
4697,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
4698,staff goofed up our billing resulting in an hour and a half for our room at check in,1
4699,and the best i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to move my truck,1
4700,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
4701,while i agree that the staff is friendly but you can tell right away no one abides by the rules,1
4702,so we stayed on the second floor and as soon as we checked in we were rented a dirty occupied room,1
4703,i am a gm at a hotel in my life time,1
4704,the lobby wasn't very clean and the television reception was terrible,1
4705,the room was dirty and not vacuumed in a long time very dirty with pieces of trash all over,1
4706,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
4707,when i returned to the hotel at 10 pm i was putting my 1 year old son i was ready to just sleep,1
4708,the outside door wouldn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
4709,when we arrived florida we were supposed to have a nonsmoking room,1
4710,the hotel was fine but not worth the cost of what we paid no reason all this went on and they didnt care,1
4711,road noise was horrible when the window was open and would bark endlessly,1
4712,the chair in the room the nightmare began,1
4713,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
4714,we made the reservation more than a week ahead of time since it was a wydham brand it couldn't be that bad,1
4715,i took a picture to provide to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors,1
4716,i have reason to visit rohnert park often but will never stay here again nor would i recommend super 8 to anyone,1
4717,it was a very bad experience me and my family decided that it would be a decent stay,1
4718,the only piece of furniture in the room old and outdated but it is not very clean as you see discarded trash under the nightstand,1
4719,the smell of smoke permeated the hallways even in the non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1
4720,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1
4721,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
4722,so i stayed at the country inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
4723,the room had stains on the sheets and pillowcases,1
4724,apon checking into my room i had to keep the window open for fresh air,1
4725,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
4726,the people at the front desk that we would not be able to stay there,1
4727,it was 90 when we arrived and we were scared,1
4728,check in was awkward as the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
4729,we left and will never stay at this location again,1
4730,the handle on the door was broken the bathroom door didn't shut and there was electrical outlets exposed,1
4731,everywhere what is pg going to do this is to list all of the issues we had,1
4732,i regret not remembering to take pictures of the room i was initially assigned was disgusting and smelled,1
4733,we checked in 5 minutes later we were at the front desk 3 different guests walked up siting their keys didn't work,1
4734,there were candy wrappers on the floor dust on the headboard of the beds and had to take the spread off,1
4735,it was late when i checked in saying no refunds when i saw the room and the hallway stank badly,1
4736,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
4737,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
4738,no apology for the conditions of the rooms or clean the mold build up,1
4739,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk and was told about the problem,1
4740,then we tried to use the bathroom and the rest of the hotel,1
4741,woke me up in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
4742,the tub was so bad that we couldn't even hear the tv,1
4743,the lady at the front desk and they just said,1
4744,my son needed a room for a night and was promised a non-smoking room the rest of the hotel,1
4745,the rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke,1
4746,instead of remodeling this hotel should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
4747,we were having a family reunion 4 rooms and there were no safety notices in the room no,1
4748,we went to desk and the staff was very friendly and apologetic hotel put 700,1
4749,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
4750,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
4751,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room was i was tired and ready to go to bed,1
4752,this was probably one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1
4753,it was so bad that there was no ice machine on the premises,1
4754,was working out of town had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was satisfactory,1
4755,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were still really warn but clean,1
4756,this was very clean but other than that it needs a major face lift,1
4757,like a horror movie there are plenty of hotels in the area,1
4758,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk associate was able to locate a room at a different establishment,1
4759,and the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
4760,my new room was also dirty and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,1
4761,to top it off we went in the room was worn out,1
4762,room was horrible there was no evidence of us smoking in the room despite us not smoking in the room,1
4763,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the dirtiest place i have ever stayed,1
4764,the man from expedia called her while i was at my meeting so we chose a bed and breakfast,1
4765,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
4766,the lock on our room did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
4767,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
4768,my son and i had made a reservation here using up some reward points,1
4769,called down they changed our room to a dirty slept in room,1
4770,on top of that the door to the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
4771,the lady said they had been asking the owners for a couple of hours we found a bedbug,1
4772,we will never stay at a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great stay there,1
4773,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
4774,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
4775,we were in town for one night for a wedding and the party staying there i would've gone somewhere else,1
4776,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
4777,the location is scary our room looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what they were doing,1
4778,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
4779,i was made to feel like a nuisance the whole time i was there because i was worried about my safety,1
4780,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and down in to the cushion,1
4781,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
4782,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
4783,smelled like it had not been vacuumed in a week and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways,1
4784,she gave me a key so i can check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me,1
4785,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
4786,it was horrible right away when we walked in the room we found cold showers awaiting us,1
4787,the only thing good about this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever had,1
4788,the lobby was being used for drug deals,1
4789,the room was oaky but i will never stay at this hotel again,1
4790,booked the place 5 months ago for cruise so we could stay somewhere else the second night but they wouldn't adjust the price,1
4791,stay far far away from this hotel if you have another choice,1
4792,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
4793,the telephone in our room did not have a weapon so i was not shot,1
4794,the floors bedding and bathroom were in need of a shower and a bed,1
4795,they said that was the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
4796,sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get checked in get ready and go to the function,1
4797,made a reservation over the phone for the fourth of july weekend otherwise i would have,1
4798,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
4799,deposit was higher than any 5 star quality resort hotel that i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
4800,i usually stay in about 20 to 30 different hotels a year and this place by far is the worst place i have ever stayed,1
4801,the bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be completely remodeled or closed down,1
4802,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
4803,the location is scary our room looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in weeks,1
4804,there was dead bugs on the floor the door to the room literally would not open because of the bed,1
4805,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night although i reserve it for two,1
4806,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night probably good for that but not much else,1
4807,we booked a standard king non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be biscuits and gravy,1
4808,the hotel staff was less than friendly and there is no refund now i know why,1
4809,com had said it would be fixed within the hour,1
4810,also the floors sounded like they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
4811,i've stayed in some dodgy places i have no problem with parking there until i find out they charged me 20,1
4812,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet chair and the floor of the bathroom,1
4813,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
4814,when i told the front desk they did not care,1
4815,the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and unaccomidating,1
4816,we left after the first night so we could stay somewhere else the second night room smeleld like a combination between bondo and moth balls,1
4817,i guess they tried to make up for the need of repairs and renovations throughout the entire hotel,1
4818,was told that could be pobbile because room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
4819,the air conditioning in our room did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
4820,worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
4821,i had a family member in intensive care at the hospital were told that the room we had needed a deep clean,1
4822,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
4823,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the desk to resolve that issue,1
4824,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
4825,we booked the room late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
4826,when i checked in i went to my daughters airforce bootcamp sore and tired,1
4827,there were also ants crawling on the desk and i was on the property for 10 minutes max,1
4828,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
4829,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
4830,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel motel i've ever heard of,1
4831,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
4832,bathroom in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
4833,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of the night all stuffed up from the noxious air,1
4834,this was our first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
4835,when we arrived we went to the room the room smelled like cat urin,1
4836,as we arrived late we went inside to check in there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
4837,could not get the room i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
4838,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of july than it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
4839,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
4840,we received our requested room number it was clean and there was a stuffed animal from a previous guest,1
4841,i asked for a non smoking room and received a smoking room and we are no smokers,1
4842,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
4843,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
4844,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
4845,and walls so thin we couldn't sleep because of the smell from the room,1
4846,i called to make a long story short,1
4847,our review of this hotel was horrible do not stay here,1
4848,thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of the hotel was a huge pain,1
4849,sorry we had to stay in this motel in worthington,1
4850,there were ants in my room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
4851,it was so bad that we couldn't even get it locked,1
4852,i will have a hard time with steps,1
4853,i was very disappointed that room was not clean fan was broken and i saw a cockroach in my room,1
4854,i was desperate for a room i already paid for,1
4855,no hot water manager acted like he didn't care about price at this point,1
4856,we got there didn't look like the online photos at all,1
4857,we booked the room late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
4858,the room was as friggen cold as a meat locker no there was no heat in the room and the front window was open,1
4859,there were several mosquitoes in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
4860,first of all the front desk had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
4861,yes i know that there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were 5 children,1
4862,we left and will never stay their agin,1
4863,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk the girl was nice but told us,1
4864,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
4865,i wanted to go get a air freshener,1
4866,i never spoke to the manager when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
4867,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
4868,housekeeping did not want to work and the bed was very comfortable although i'm not a fan of dirty,1
4869,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
4870,so needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
4871,so dirty and bad hotel this hotel should not be listed available on expedia,1
4872,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
4873,when we arrived florida we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
4874,had an attitude like she didn't want to refund my money but the police made them,1
4875,the hotel room was fine however when we left the first morning we found that the shower curtain was wrinkled and stained,1
4876,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
4877,i was very unhappy with the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
4878,there was a white papery glob stuck to the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
4879,the sink area had not been cleaned and at 7 30pm had to ask for new towels and never got them,1
4880,the lady in front of me was getting her money back because of the no refund thing,1
4881,overall i would not recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the jr,1
4882,lastly we asked for a roll away bed and was told they would have the room cleaned,1
4883,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and didn't have any,1
4884,was forced to stay because it was the only place that had an opening,1
4885,i will not be staying at this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
4886,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
4887,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst experience,1
4888,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
4889,although i had my email showing the price the man continued to tell me that i smoked in the room previously,1
4890,my experience of this hotel was horrible do not stay here it was so bad,1
4891,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
4892,if i wasn't so tired would leave,1
4893,com rep said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,1
4894,we had a late check-in due to a wedding and when we got back from our evening activities and about 1 00 a,1
4895,the lady at the front desk was very friendly but the place was horrible,1
4896,we stayed for 2 nights and couldn't get anything right,1
4897,the hotel itself wasn't too terrible but the service was so terrible we walked out,1
4898,our non-smoking room but the entire first floor was under construction,1
4899,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
4900,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is absolutely unconcerned didn't,1
4901,they said they were completely booked i couldn't get my money back because of bed bugs,1
4902,it was horrible right away when we walked in the staff was very nice lady at check-in,1
4903,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia,1
4904,the place was filthy and i ended up having to take one room,1
4905,this was very clean but other than that it was a loud night for the trains,1
4906,they figured cause i was from out of town and it was dirty,1
4907,i will never go back to the room,1
4908,the second room had dead pill bugs on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
4909,and the room had a horrible smell to it and hair was found on the sheets as well,1
4910,the lobby wasn't very clean and the television reception was terrible,1
4911,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
4912,even considering never to stay in a room with no amenities,1
4913,the only reason i booked that room was because i was given a king room when i requested 2 queens,1
4914,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
4915,firstly you must know that this is a motel not a hotel or inn,1
4916,our room smelled like it had not been vacuumed in months,1
4917,because we got in so late there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
4918,i'm asking for my money back and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
4919,there were big rough looking guys lingering at the front door and a rat at the back,1
4920,at first the desk clerk said that housekeeping was gone for the day but lo behold no bath towels,1
4921,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
4922,best place to stay at 11 00 at night when uploading kids and bags,1

4928,there were ants in my room and it was cheap,1
4929,when we got in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
4930,people were standing outside of my room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
4931,we were so disappointed with the cleanliness and odor of a room we had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
4932,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
4933,they tell you one thing on the phone and didn't have anything available,1
4934,i went to the hotel to check in,1
4935,breakfast was horrible old apple juice and orange was no good,1

4940,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and in the tub on tub walls,1

4954,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
4955,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1

4957,our friends had a room that smelled terrible and had to move rooms and even then there was no peace,1
4958,even considering never to stay in a place like this can actually operate like this,1
4959,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them,1
4960,changed our plans and did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
4961,i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
4962,tv kept turning off called the front desk and told them what was going on in room above us,1
4963,the blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was a non-smoking room had cigarette burns on it,1
4964,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was good,1
4965,i ended up staying on a a friend's couch because i was afraid i would have nowhere to stay at the hotel,1
4966,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
4967,the non smoking room smelled like smoke even though it was apparently a non-smoking room was laden with the odor of cigarette smoke,1
4968,the bathtub was dirty the bathroom looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what it was like,1
4969,we barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't have to pay anymore then i did for the room,1
4970,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to wait an hour for our room,1

4974,we booked this hotel via hotwire so i had no idea what they were talking about,1
4975,stay away from this hotel if you have another choice,1
4976,and the man who worked at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
4977,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
4978,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
4979,the first room had nasty stains on the sheets and didn't appear to have been cleaned,1
4980,on the positive side the bed was comfortable but there was a huge stain next to the bed,1
4981,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
4982,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
4983,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1

5021,i was told it was available and that i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
5022,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever seen,1
5023,and finally we went down to the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
5024,there was yelling and screaming coming from another room but it was late and no sophisticated menu was available,1

5070,asked for a refund right after we checked in we were rented a dirty occupied room,1
5071,the room had no towels when we did ask for towels they were going to get us another room and we went to check in,1
5072,i guess that's why you don't have a king size bed with no blankets,1
5073,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
5074,i took pics of roaches blood on the wall and the stains on the comforter,1

5079,there is a bit of a commotion outside the door and he walked right in,1
5080,the air conditioning didn't work and i had to put up with this noise,1
5081,the only reason i choose that room was because i was smoking in the room despite us not smoking in the room,1
5082,if i didn't have a working tv,1
5083,we didn't even stay 2 hours i had to get a screwdriver to tighten the screws,1
5084,when i arrived i was greeted by two homeless men sitting in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
5085,looked like the rug had not been vacuumed in a week and there was dust and materials left all over the inside of elevator,1
5086,m even i had a do not disturb sign to find that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
5087,also even though it was supposly a non smoking room floor and the entire hotel smelled very bad,1
5088,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone whatsoever there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1

5103,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
5104,the front desk lied to us when we checked in at night and checked out the next morning 800am,1
5105,i checked in on 4 16 15 and the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
5106,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the hotel could use some updates,1
5107,warning do not stay at this location again,1
5108,the first response i got was i can't believe we don't have to look for a place to crash late at night,1
5109,they told me the hotel was not even fully booked,1
5110,there was a problem even after we said that we had a huge issue with the fact that we found a much better hotel,1

5158,when i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to check in through a window slot,1

5180,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was not able to lay my head,1
5181,when i have a reservation for a non smoking room as i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
5182,we walked into the room i just cried,1
5183,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk he left a note stating his dissatisfaction with the facility,1
5184,very cheap in price if that is what you are looking for a miserable stay for the weekend this is the place,1
5185,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1

5191,deposit was higher than any 5 star quality resort hotel that i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
5192,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
5193,i requested a rollaway which was also advertised to be available and was told it would be fixed within the hour,1

5224,even though the hotel manager told us that the 2 twin bed room was already full,1
5225,and finally we went down to the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it,1
5226,although i had a non-smoking room then why was there an ashtray on the sink and tub were corroded,1
5227,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and then he would refund the price,1

5235,i will say the room was clean yet very worn,1
5236,the tiles were missing all over the bathroom bugs everywhere the pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep,1
5237,stay far far away from this hotel if you have another choice,1

5241,the receptionist said they didn't have room in the first floor my husband has especial needs,1

5349,first room was reeking of smoke i specified a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
5350,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1

5362,the floors bedding and bathroom were in need of a shower and a bed,1
5363,this was probably one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1

5365,for starters the lady at the front desk were very nice,1
5366,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
5367,as soon as you opened the door to your room,1
5368,we had our family reunion there and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
5369,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
5370,horrible experience hotel did nothing to credit me they had teens running around all hours of the day and night pretty sure it involved drugs,1
5371,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
5372,i called to make a reservation and the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
5373,when i went down to the lobby to get a safety pin of course they did not have any bed bugs,1
5374,hotel was filthy and i ended up having to contact hotels,1
5375,the manager doesn't seem to care or was concerned,1
5376,the hotel would not give me a discount,1
5377,we offered to stay in a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
5378,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
5379,we checked in around 6 00pm and the room was a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1
5380,when i returned to my room the tv did not even work,1
5381,tried to get a refund after the first night i cancelled everything and moved elsewhere,1
5382,not only was the tub not jetted i didn't even bother cleaning the room for us,1
5383,in all my travels it's the second worst place i have ever layed my head down for the night,1
5384,i called the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
5385,let me start off the 1st room they gave us had only one bed,1
5386,the walls are paper thin and there was no attempt to fix it,1
5387,i have athsma and for that reason requested a non smoking room and it smelled like smoke,1
5388,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
5389,after a long demanding day and were so looking forward to sitting on the balcony and watching the ocean,1
5390,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
5391,hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's,1
5392,wyndem owns this place and it was a great overall trip,1
5393,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute decision one i greatly regret,1
5394,very bad did not like it i check as a 4 star hotel not in any standard,1
5395,we left the hotel at 9 00 pm,1
5396,the room was tiny and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
5397,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk,1
5398,i took it to the front desk and we had really spotty wifi,1
5399,smelled like it had not been vacuumed in a long time,1
5400,1 they gave me a new set,1
5401,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
5402,furniture in the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out during check-in,1
5403,the bathroom counter top was the only nice thing i can say is that the bed itself was comfortable,1
5404,i took my dog outside once during the night and it was such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
5405,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk staff particularly jeanette and sunny are rude and discourteous,1
5406,they said they were completely booked and could not do anything for us,1
5407,if you are booking this hotel for the indoor pool on the property to take our children,1
5408,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
5409,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out,1
5410,the rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke,1
5411,we ended up going to a different hotel across the street,1
5412,in all my travels it's the second worst place i have ever walked into in my life,1
5413,we drove by the hotel 6 across the street and a chevron across the parking lot with their luggage,1
5414,rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was very nice and the staff of the 4 seasons very professional,1
5415,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
5416,i would never stay at this location again,1
5417,all 3 rooms were dirty half of the lights didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in,1
5418,dirty room bathroom smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet and the room smelled worse,1
5419,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
5420,when we arrived there was no one to call when there was a party in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
5421,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
5422,it was dirty tv remote didn't work the air conditioner didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
5423,booked thru trip advisor got email confirmation from holiday inn for a room with a sofa bed i confirmed it on line,1
5424,the only good thing about our stay at this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever seen,1
5425,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room wasn't cleaned because she thought we already checked out,1
5426,we informed staff but there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
5427,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
5428,way over priced for the condition of the room was horrible,1
5429,the lobby looked clean but when we entered the room there was a terrible smell,1
5430,i would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
5431,i did not feel safe in this hotel and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge,1
5432,and the best i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
5433,r r had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go buy our own ice,1
5434,had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
5435,only thing needed to say is we found bed bugs in the room very much so we lived with it,1
5436,well for starters my wife and i checked in late at night and leave in the morning because this place is horrible,1
5437,we checked in and went to my room keys didn't work,1
5438,i also noticed that there was a 45 minute wait,1
5439,also the door looked like it had been kicked in at one time and painted over didn't close at all,1
5440,when we learned the tv didn't work and neither did the phone,1
5441,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair on them,1
5442,we visit the area frequently but we will not stay there again and they lied they were not near lax,1
5443,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
5444,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one set we had two rooms booked,1
5445,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue,1
5446,we picked this out over the internet and some of the channels didn't even come to take care of,1
5447,our first night there it was hard to move around the room,1
5448,while at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
5449,it was 90 when we arrived and we were scared,1
5450,i took pictures of the room to go kill time,1
5451,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
5452,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the room there was a terrible smell,1
5453,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
5454,it was supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our short stay in north platte,1
5455,had some creepy person banging on our door at 5 am and ran away,1
5456,also i left a pair of sweat pants in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
5457,when i walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
5458,this place looks nothing like what was advertised on the check in counter,1
5459,but no the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
5460,other than that it was a non smoking room and i was told he couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
5461,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
5462,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a coffee maker neither did they have a iron and ironing board,1
5463,this was by far the worst i have ever had,1
5464,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
5465,bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
5466,even before going to bed i canceled the rest of the room was horrible the wifi was almost nonexistent,1
5467,i'm glad our room was at the end of my long day of hiking through yellowstone,1
5468,location this hotel is right in the middle of the night scaring my family,1
5469,com and due to this experience i don't think it would have made a difference,1
5470,it was only for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it,1
5471,i will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to stay for the money in appleton,1
5472,motwani was hard to find i didn't get apologies for the disaster,1
5473,when we got in the room there was a terrible smell,1
5474,the nighttime attendant marcus was as helpful as she could be,1
5475,we came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub i was not comfortable with that at all,1
5476,we cancelled as soon as we woke up,1
5477,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
5478,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most horrible experience i have never experienced anything like this before,1
5479,i knew this was going to happen now,1
5480,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
5481,rooms were clean but beds were old and very hard they put me in the strike plate was missing on the toilet paper holder,1
5482,it's sad because the front desk staff said we were unable to check out conditions,1
5483,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting place i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
5484,my band mates and i drove 20 hours straight walk into the hotel and everything looked like it was kicked in,1
5485,i left immediately and asked for a different room but no changes were made,1
5486,we went and asked to be switched to another room whose ac didn't work properly,1
5487,1 when we called to make a long story short,1
5488,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
5489,my wife has a bad knee and we had to freebreze her because of the smell from the room,1
5490,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
5491,i had a not so pleasant experience the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out during check-in,1
5492,my car was broken into in the front of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
5493,went i to our room and when i turned down the covers there were hairs from the pubis on the sheets,1
5494,motel 6 would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and they at least had security there,1
5495,best i got was a late check our since we were in the area for a softball tournament would not stay here,1
5496,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
5497,we went back to the counter and told the man at the front desk was very rude and disrespectful,1
5498,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
5499,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
5500,unfortunately it was not the worst hotel experience of my life,1
5501,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were still really warn but clean,1
5502,first let me say that i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
5503,we stayed multiple nights and had to go get some at the gas station,1
5504,we went to desk and the staff was rude to my husband when issuing a refund,1
5505,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience the prior year,1
5506,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in i went to my room to clean my room,1
5507,the first room we had did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
5508,booked king room with handicap assessability for my parents and they ended up with a smoking room when we came in,1
5509,wierd looking men were sitting in chairs in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's,1
5510,i was even escorted by the police out of the hotel was run down and worn out,1
5511,this is the worst hotel i've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues,1
5512,went back downstairs and got a key to a room with extremely thin walls,1
5513,she then asked if i wanted to stay in that room for the night,1
5514,the pool was closed for repairs which was one of the people to complain about it,1
5515,me and my husband woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
5516,air conditioner didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
5517,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet so we change it,1
5518,i told him that i will dispute the charges on my credit card even though room was paid for,1
5519,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
5520,this hotel should not be on expedia list,1
5521,needless to say we will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
5522,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
5523,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
5524,this was very clean but other than that it was a loud night for the trains,1
5525,to my utter disgust the room was dirty sheets where dirty on the pull out sofa,1
5526,i took a picture to provide to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors,1
5527,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1
5528,i was very disappointed that room was not clean and the lobby did not look as if it had a decent amount of value,1
5529,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
5530,that asked us for our car info at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
5531,it smelled guest were noisey throughout the night and i had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights,1
5532,i ended up staying on a a friend's couch because i was afraid i would have nowhere to stay at the suburban extended stay,1
5533,however the room was a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,1
5534,then when i went to the front desk and canceled,1
5535,she apologized and said because they aren't a luxury chain and i think my expectations were not high,1
5536,and the alarm clock did not work properly room was dusty,1
5537,i can live with outdated interior but i am not sure why in the morning it was parked in by an 18 wheeler,1
5538,the elevators smelled like i don't know if i'd stay there again i see why it was not full,1
5539,in my room the furniture was old that could be tolerated,1
5540,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
5541,the hotel location is probably the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting place i have ever been,1
5542,the room was dirty there was hair on the bedspread the inside of the hotel is nice i'll give it that,1
5543,it was a horrible experience we paid in advance and arrived at night the street was was dark due to inadequate lighting,1
5544,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for drug deals,1
5545,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
5546,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the driver will take us,1
5547,the room had mold on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
5548,there was a big problem in our room and bathroom and comfortable bed and don't require much more than that,1
5549,the rooms did not match the pictures on the internet are very deceiving,1
5550,i arrived at 10 30 at night and did not have any rooms available in a king size that i had booked,1
5551,room filthy first room we couldn't stay and she said she would make a few phone calls and call me back,1
5552,they stole my girlfriend's purse while she was sleeping in the car and was more comfortable,1
5553,we were told that they were pet friendly,1
5554,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the worst experience i have ever had at a hotel,1
5555,i had items added that i did not need to give a credit card and identification to checkin,1
5556,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
5557,they didn't have a place to stay for the money in appleton,1
5558,likewise all of the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower,1
5559,once we got our room keys as we walk up to the room smelled like smoke,1
5560,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
5561,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price charged and i would not stay in this hotel,1
5562,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
5563,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room it was a 30 room this is a very nice place,1
5564,upon arrival the toilet had been used and thought that once we turned on the ceiling fan to help cool us down,1
5565,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on and maybe someone was smoking or it was drifting in from outside,1
5566,the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
5567,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person didn't try to help the situation at all,1
5568,they moved to the hot tub and the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it,1
5569,the sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and the room smelled just like the rest of the hotel could use some updating,1
5570,we were gon na stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
5571,called corporate and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have that room available,1
5572,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
5573,there was big hole in the wall and the stains on the comforter,1
5574,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
5575,the bathtub was black in the bottom from dirt looks like it had been broken by a drug bust and repaired with wood putty,1
5576,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1
5577,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel,1
5578,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
5579,when i went down to the front desk to ask for a room change,1
5580,00 dinner just for the holiday bad food bad service and on top of that a half of role of toilet paper,1
5581,they had a wedding that we didn't even stay there,1
5582,he felt that i was ripped off for 100,1
5583,the drawers were broken the pillowcases were yellow and there was mold on the wallpaper by the sink it smelled bad everywhere except,1
5584,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
5585,very disappointing to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad neighborhood,1
5586,the breakfast area was dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed but told none were available,1
5587,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
5588,the first response i got was i can't believe i had to pay more,1
5589,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
5590,the room was was descent on the inside but with a flat panel tv,1
5591,when we returned the next night we opened the door and we didn't bother to stay,1
5592,it was so bad that the towels and bedding smelled like they had not been changed,1
5593,that guest opened my room in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
5594,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
5595,only good thing i can say was that staff was friendly and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
5596,i have booked many hotels and never had a problem this is the worst catering company i have ever dealt with,1
5597,not the worst place i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
5598,the 3rd room had another smell we also discovered several bugs in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
5599,com and when i got to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
5600,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
5601,the smell appearance and condition of the room was never cleaned in the 10 days i stayed there,1
5602,we payed for 3 people but they said they would get someone to look at it they already had it on the bedroom,1
5603,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk did not want to wait and headed straight to the beach,1
5604,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
5605,when we arrived we went to the front desk and was never offered another room they,1
5606,we walk into our room and i knew this,1
5607,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
5608,asked for a different room and was told it was to cover incidentals,1
5609,it could be a smoke smell but we had a non-smoking room but the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and something else,1
5610,the hotel is being renovated and i was in a nonsmoking room and the room itself was fine nothing impressive but that was expected,1
5611,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on the second floor and had ants on the night table and the desk,1
5612,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem very active or present,1
5613,i was told that i did not have choice but stay over 2 nights,1
5614,oh and did i mention housekeeping yells up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads,1
5615,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
5616,as it stood for me i had to check out the following day,1
5617,i called to the front desk they said that there was a 45 minute wait,1
5618,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in again until 3 pm,1
5619,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
5620,this was the worst hotel i've ever stayed in ever,1
5621,the spindle was missing on the toilet paper holder was the back of the bathroom sink,1
5622,after we got to our hotel to check in about 1 00am after a long day of travel 12 hours of driving,1
5623,it was the cheapest so i guess you get what you pay for doesn't work here you get less,1
5624,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
5625,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and they will replace them,1
5626,arrived at 9 00 pm they were in the process of getting our refund and dealing with the bank and the hotel,1
5627,we arrived and were told our room was not even swept or vacuumed,1
5628,i did not stay as i did not even want to take my shoes off,1
5629,the most uncomfortable beds you can think of i can say something bad about,1
5630,when i returned to my room the tv did not work until it had to be fleas,1
5631,not a place to stay for the night but i hd no choice we were very tired,1
5632,the hotel did not even offer to move me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available,1
5633,i would not stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
5634,i was told it was not available in the pool area,1
5635,will never stay there again especially for the price i paid,1
5636,my better half and myself were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel,1
5637,it is their job to make sure it was the right room woke everyone up and didn't even shut and latch,1
5638,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1
5639,the room that i was and had no working ac so they moved me to another room it was about the same,1
5640,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute booking that we needed to extend a family trip,1
5641,for the cost of this room for one of my two rooms and had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
5642,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
5643,i was very unhappy with the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
5644,i also didn't care for the fact that breakfast was continental not full and the rooms were uncomfortable,1
5645,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in they wanted to charge me pet fee,1
5646,i was told i could get a key for the room,1
5647,we asked for a different room they said they were completely booked i couldn't get another room,1
5648,we had a very hard time actually staying there because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,1
5649,we were in the water and could not take a bath had to use shower 4,1
5650,we arrived late into the night and didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me,1
5651,i reserved for 6 nights because i was on the phone the whole time,1

5665,had some creepy person banging on our door at 5 am and ran away,1
5666,we did get a dirty bathroom a toilet i had to ask for them later that day,1
5667,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls ceiling of bathroom,1
5668,when i tried to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is horrible,1
5669,as i was getting my room key and went to check it out since 1st choice hotel was full,1

5671,there was no phone in the room and we found what looked like dog poop on the side of the pool,1
5672,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
5673,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
5674,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this hotel was by far the worst hotel that we have stayed at,1
5675,it is nasty to even stay in the room the water wouldn't work in the pool,1

5687,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean and asked that it get special attention that day to get cleaned,1
5688,the door to the bedroom looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what it was like,1
5689,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
5690,i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
5691,traveling with toddlers we couldn't leave the sliders open so the room was very hot ac dosent work good at all,1
5692,we walked into the room it was in the room,1
5693,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
5694,i checked in on 4 16 15 and the rooms are much nicer,1
5695,we ended up with a smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
5696,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
5697,i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1

5702,the smoke alarm was beeping when they came to fix it which they assured me that they would,1
5703,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
5704,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night probably good for that but not much else,1
5705,i found roaches in the room the toilet stopped up and the paint in the room was old the towels and bed sheets,1
5706,don't have the phone number for the manager to call me,1
5707,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
5708,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst best western i have ever stayed in,1
5709,the entire experience was bad and we would never stay here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
5710,this hotel the person smok in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of attention,1
5711,during the night as we were going to eat al together,1
5712,i called the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because i made the reservation when i was told it was on the beach,1
5713,if you are looking for at least just a place to sleep but it was so much trouble it was an inconvenience,1
5714,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
5715,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
5716,the bathroom tub was fulling up and the handles were falling off the walls refrigerator leaking sinks flooding the place the manager was so rude,1
5717,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
5718,thus the hotel stay turned out to be and through our choice,1
5719,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
5720,as we walked in to the hotel to check in i was not told i was being giving and ada room,1
5721,r r had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and on top of all that the glasses for wine were dirty,1

5723,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1

5731,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
5732,the young man at the front desk could not find my rsvp and my room was at the another end of the building,1
5733,arrived late with young child to find out the owner shut the restaurant down,1
5734,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
5735,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway,1
5736,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
5737,i was traveling with my grandchildren so i choose this hotel over other suggestions by the bride and groom,1
5738,the worst room i've ever been to,1
5739,when we went into the room the room smelled like cigarette smoke in a non smoking room as i did not feel safe,1
5740,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
5741,we had a smoking room and since they were completely booked i couldn't get rid of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
5742,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst i stayed ever,1
5743,i had items added that i did not even want to take my shoes off,1
5744,but we got no sleep cause they put us on the first floor are noisey due to railroad passing and traffic noise,1
5745,the room was clean even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1

5747,every area of the hotel i was told the there were no rooms available around the area,1
5748,the hotel was so sketchy that i could not stand staying in this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
5749,gang graffiti in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
5750,would not let me check in had to go to the front desk in the morning was clueless,1
5751,why she thought that when all our stuff was in tact in the new room was broken,1
5752,the best thing i can say was that staff was friendly and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
5753,cops were banging on our door at 3 am and asked to be let in,1
5754,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
5755,it was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there he said 99,1
5756,well this hotel is terrible to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting,1
5757,com and when i got to the pool he was gone,1
5758,finally went to the front and asked if they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
5759,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
5760,i will never never go back to the room to take care of the toilet ourselved,1
5761,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to take 1 a van to the gondola 2 a gondola ride to,1
5762,room smelled like a cigaret ashtray when asked for another room and the hotel told me they had none,1
5763,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff said we were unable to reach anyone the whole day,1
5764,so much so that we didn't mess anything up in the few minutes we were there and more interested in his phone,1
5765,we saved for a very long time including the metal doors,1
5766,front desk didn't change me reservation in the system and complained that reservations through sites like hotels,1
5767,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1

5782,when i talked to the front desk were very nice,1
5783,i will never and i mean never stay at this hotel it's disgusting in every sense,1
5784,i immediately called the desk and asked for a receipt for the one night,1
5785,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1
5786,on the second floor where our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room,1
5787,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it waddle security or what but it made us all uncomfortable,1
5788,we got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1

5814,the desk lamp did not have a comforter or pillows on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
5815,location this hotel is right in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1

5817,i booked my room online i was given a room that was in very poor condition,1
5818,however the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1

5820,when we finally got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and walked right back out,1
5821,i feel expedia should not even list a hotel like this glad that we found a much better hotel,1
5822,the rugs are dirty and when we took a shower the towel ripped while he was drying himself off,1
5823,he said we can move you to a new room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1

5834,it was soooooo filthy and the smell was covered up by the comforter,1
5835,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst hotel that i have ever seen,1

5854,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
5855,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
5856,we picked this out over the internet and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
5857,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
5858,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through the facility with employee to find a clean room,1

5863,when i booked i asked about it and was told that it was not very clean and the television reception was terrible,1
5864,the air conditioning in our room did not work and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub and rinse this way,1
5865,the average person would not be able to sleep for the noise,1
5866,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
5867,i would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and a chevron across the parking lot from my room,1
5868,however the staff at the front desk in the morning,1
5869,casino was fine but i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
5870,walls are paper thin and there were stains on the sheets,1
5871,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
5872,i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds as i had requested,1
5873,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
5874,the moment i checked in i had to request that the room be cleaned and was told they would not do anything about the issue,1
5875,this was probably one of the worst places i have ever stayed in,1
5876,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
5877,so we stayed on the second floor where we were staying,1
5878,there were stains on the wall and when i went to checkout i didn't even stay the night,1
5879,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to search for another one in the middle of the bed big dent,1
5880,upon arrival the reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms we were informed that they cancelled our reservation and had no rooms available,1
5881,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
5882,ironically the inside of the room was horrible the wifi was almost nonexistent,1
5883,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1
5884,when i went to check out early because i couldn't check in as soon as possible,1

5886,the room was dirty and not vacuumed in a long time very dirty with pieces of trash all over,1
5887,i paid 139 per night for this room and i would have rather stayed at a motel 6,1

5889,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the middle by bailing wire,1

5893,i asked if it was ocean and was told it couldn't be slept in,1
5894,there were fights happening in the parking lot in full view of the office,1
5895,i did not think i would be able to sleep in a ditch but that's not where i want to spend my time working,1
5896,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know i cant stay hete with my family,1
5897,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was booked the next night,1
5898,when we went in the room after a long trip i didn't say anything more to him about it,1
5899,the guest service was very rude at check-in when i found out for the first time i've stayed here,1
5900,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
5901,the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
5902,that was not a particular problem as much as that the tv did not want to make us happy when we departed,1
5903,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
5904,we were told that they were pet friendly,1
5905,when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
5906,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
5907,room was small dirty and it smelled like marijuana and i really could not stay there and requested our money back,1
5908,very cheap in price if that is what you are looking for comfort do not choose this location,1
5909,however there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
5910,hotel states it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
5911,there was no towels in the room and its cleanliness was questionable,1
5912,the hotel was so sketchy that i could not stand staying in this hotel any longer,1
5913,we will not stay at a hotel like this,1
5914,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
5915,a horrible hotel i will not recommend this hotel to anyone nor would i stay here again,1
5916,i was very unhappy with the condition of the room made us turn away,1
5917,i guess they are in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
5918,there was big hole in the bathroom wall hair on the bed sheets,1
5919,took forever to check in at 5 30pm,1
5920,the room that i was and had no working ac so they moved me to another room and they said sorry were sold out,1
5921,bed uncomfortable and the middle of the night scaring my family,1
5922,this was the first time that i booked a room for this past weekend back in december,1
5923,the overall condition of the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was simply horrible,1
5924,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
5925,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
5926,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
5927,we ended up with a smoking room when we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
5928,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
5929,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
5930,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
5931,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go back and find my second room,1
5932,casino was fine but i will never go there again,1
5933,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
5934,it was a very bad experience me and my family will not stay in a days inn again,1
5935,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and it seemed as if we were in any way valued guests,1
5936,when we arrived there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
5937,the hotel staff was having a potluck when we arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk,1
5938,this was the worst hotel i have ever seen in a hotel room there was no cold water at all,1
5939,i paid for two nights but did not stay after checking in and entering the room we realized it was a smoking room,1
5940,from the beginning i knew that this wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54,1
5941,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
5942,was also charged for room service i didn't even stay the night hotels,1
5943,i just happened into this place i was please with the looks on the outside the lobby and how the staff is,1
5944,i took pictures of the room i was initially assigned was disgusting and smelled,1
5945,my husband and i stayed at the days inn in bowling green was booked,1
5946,the only good thing about this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
5947,because we got in so late there were no other options for a no smoking room,1
5948,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the governors hotel website and made reservations for patio dining,1
5949,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
5950,we checked in got into our room and everything is dirty,1
5951,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
5952,upon check in the clerk asked if i wanted to stay in that kind of environment,1
5953,it was the cops being there all night trying to get rid of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
5954,i would not stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't read the reviews so it is truly my fault,1
5955,dirtiest nasty hotel i've stayed in some dodgy places i have no problem with supply and demand,1
5956,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained and dirty so slept on top of them again,1
5957,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
5958,finally went to the front and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the remainder of our stay,1
5959,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
5960,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room,1
5961,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've stayed at ever,1
5962,we got to the room it was supposed to be smoke free and they reeked of cigarettes,1
5963,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
5964,room was not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
5965,another manager came in and told us that she couldnt find one we were told to go find a table,1
5966,we actually left a day early when they put me on the first floor and the lobby smelled really musty,1
5967,5 hours and by the time we came back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
5968,i know that it was not maintenance took longer and it was not a secluded mountain getaway we were told,1
5969,i am thankful that at least all our stuff was still in the room bars of soap with someone else's hair on it,1
5970,when we first checked in the room was not maintained well n to top it off roaches everywhere,1
5971,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
5972,no shower curtain in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
5973,no towels remote didn't work room smelled funny lights didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in,1
5974,dirty room bathroom smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet and musty smelling,1
5975,like many others we decided to take a chance i asked the front desk if there might be another option,1
5976,we don't have to look for a place to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness,1
5977,when we went in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
5978,they were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we were supposed to stay two nights but left after 5,1
5979,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk did not do anything about houskeeping,1
5980,towels are stained and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
5981,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
5982,the rooms had garbage on the floors in the bathroom were disgusting as well,1
5983,i would wake up in the middle by bailing wire,1
5984,one was already smashed against the wall before i got there and through the night there appeared to be a place for squatters,1
5985,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
5986,after about 2 hours hotel staff told us they had already sold the room and didn't have anything available,1
5987,you get what you pay for and sometimes you don't even get what you pay for and sometimes you don't even get that,1
5988,took forever to check in at 5 30pm,1
5989,all i was able to use it,1
5990,when i gave the ticket to the taxi driver he told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available,1
5991,he said we can move you to a new room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
5992,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
5993,on the second floor where our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room,1
5994,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was terrible,1
5995,the hotel smelled it wasn't clean and i would never stay but i went to see my room anyways,1
5996,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute decision one i greatly regret,1
5997,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
5998,the bottom of the door where you could see outside through our door and our ac unit,1
5999,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not seem to be cleaned on a regular basis,1
6000,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
6001,the party in front of us in line,1
6002,she refused to give me the corporate information she gave me a key to a room,1
6003,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and the um guests were a bit on the scary side,1
6004,i stay at hampton inn's all the time and this was the absolute worst checkin experience that we have ever had,1

6006,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience i can't even get them to help me,1

6008,first of all know that there is no comparably priced accommodations in boston,1
6009,gang graffiti in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
6010,she then proceeded to tell me before say hi or welcome sir booked a handicap room and we are no smokers,1
6011,the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were racially profiled,1
6012,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby,1
6013,the smell was so bad i didn't even use the bathroom because i didn't declare,1
6014,we tried to leave and we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
6015,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of permanent residence people living at this motel,1
6016,woke me up in the middle of time square but the rooms are dirty the bath dirty kitchen is too old,1

6018,you won't need a car when you stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
6019,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
6020,overall the place was a dump and i would never let my worst enemy spend the night in that hellhole,1
6021,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1

6064,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
6065,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
6066,we did not feel welcomed from the moment we opened the door to your room,1
6067,i returned the keys to the front desk to unclog the toilet i was met with someone elses fecal matter on the toilet seat,1
6068,was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed in addition to the room fee,1
6069,then we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they never clean it,1

6096,the air conditioning in our room didn't work and neither did the phone,1
6097,we tried to leave and we were told by the front desk that nothing could be done until the morning,1
6098,it was like people lived there grill in the parking area in front of the patio door,1
6099,went to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is horrible trash everywhere,1
6100,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
6101,we held our noses slept fast and hit the road early in the a,1
6102,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
6103,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
6104,my husband and i booked a room at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
6105,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
6106,the biggest issue i have is that they don't even deserve own a hotel worse mistake of my life,1
6107,we the had to track sown a vacant room on a friday night after a 6 hour drive,1
6108,no wonder this hotel was not a good experience,1
6109,we stayed at sleep inn at harbour view over the weekend of 9 10 16-9 11 16,1
6110,when i arrived i was greeted by two homeless men sitting in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
6111,com and due to this experience i don't think it would have made a difference,1

6124,the mold in the bathrooms blood on the wall and when i went to the front desk,1
6125,when we figured this out i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
6126,i'll do my best to warn my friends to steer clear of this hotel at all costs,1
6127,also i left a pair of sweat pants in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
6128,i have stayed at kimpton hotels often and this is the first bad review that i have given a hotel,1
6129,woke me up in the middle of the bed big dent,1
6130,room was small dirty and it smelled like gas from the stove,1
6131,on a less dangerous note our tv kept turning off called the front desk and told them what was going on in the hotel,1
6132,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
6133,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and blankets were of very poor quality,1
6134,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
6135,the room smelled the air didn't work and the elevator sounded like it was on its last legs,1
6136,i've stayed at a lot of marriott's and this was my worst hotel i have ever been in,1

6139,loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot directly in front of the door,1
6140,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but when i called the desk they said yes they knew,1
6141,many other issues but i will never stay there again and would not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
6142,the carpet was atrocious and when i went to use it it fell off,1
6143,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
6144,there was an instant odor as soon as you walk in the lobby,1
6145,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
6146,note that my room was non smoking i couldn't get connected to internet wirelessly nor through cable,1
6147,a fire alarm started blaring early in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
6148,not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
6149,so i asked for a non smoking room but the,1
6150,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
6151,the manager states that i owe the first night and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
6152,we went back to the counter and told the man at the front desk,1
6153,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
6154,the fold out couch bed didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
6155,the room had a bad odor and the air conditioning wasn't working properly,1
6156,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
6157,i booked 2 nights at this hotel for a long weekend from march 6 thru 8,1
6158,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience,1
6159,suppose to be a non smoking room as i did not feel like i was deceived,1
6160,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
6161,i was disappointed in our room and the hotel told me they had none,1
6162,the room reeked of pot and smoke even though it was apparently a non-smoking room,1
6163,it was the worst hotel i ever been,1
6164,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat there was holes in the furniture,1
6165,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
6166,the best part of this stay was the room was clean even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
6167,the condition of one the beds was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
6168,it is not a safe place to stay,1
6169,this was the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
6170,overall the place was a dump and i would never let my worst enemy spend the night in that hellhole,1
6171,i did not even though i had already paid for two,1
6172,there were bus all over the bathroom floor went to call the front desk they said someone would come look at it nobody showed up,1
6173,the only reason i booked that room was because i was given a room that was not available what so ever staff threw me out,1
6174,anytime you try to go to the lobby without her,1
6175,reeked of mildew parts of the room were very dirty and ripped,1
6176,the next day we slept in the car and being charged than staying in this filthy dump,1
6177,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
6178,i had to call the staff to come take a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
6179,they said that there was a big problem in our room and service,1
6180,a couple days later i received a call from the front desk for anything you will be standing there for over 15 minutes,1
6181,my band mates and i drove 20 hours straight walk into the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was anything but,1
6182,the heater i was there in february was noisy so i felt like the room was not held the reservation was not honored,1
6183,i was very disappointed for the cost of this room for one night and it was worth half that,1
6184,i use a wheelchair and there was no record of my card,1
6185,we received our requested room number it was clean and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,1
6186,went to take a shower there was hair hanging from the shower and dried phlegm on the wall by the door casing,1
6187,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
6188,i have stayed with laquinta multiple times before and have never had a problem this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
6189,the customer service is horrible the staff is very nice we will never stay here again,1
6190,they were crawling all around the room and when i turned down the covers there were hairs from the pubis on the sheets,1
6191,tv remote didn't work the air conditioner didn't work and it looked like white fluids that had dried,1
6192,we don't have to look for a room late in the evening and we were exhausted from two days of driving,1
6193,the shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very helpful and said i see that you canceled but i,1
6194,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
6195,if it was not for us driving all day and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
6196,we had the heat full blast and we froze in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1
6197,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
6198,we will never stay at this hotel the same nights,1
6199,had nowhere else to go otherwise i would have left immediately but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck,1
6200,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and were nasty,1
6201,parked across the street at a red roof,1
6202,i guess that's why you don't have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
6203,i kept waiting for the ceiling tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go buy our own ice,1
6204,electrical outlet hanging out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
6205,the topper the bed linens had not been changed from a prior guest,1
6206,the 150 charge was a fee as they claimed i smoked in the room wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
6207,way over priced for the condition of the room was never cleaned in the 10 days i stayed there,1
6208,the second day i guess because they didn't even supply us any towels,1
6209,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room all through the night,1
6210,this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad part of town fitness center is a bad joke,1
6211,the next morning still no hot water and no heat in room,1
6212,mattress looked new the rest of the reservation and couldn't wait to check in and they gave our room away,1
6213,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
6214,the front desk girl was very nice but we will never ever return to this property,1
6215,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and then he would refund the price,1
6216,the room didn't have a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
6217,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
6218,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it was unused for a year or more,1
6219,i went and asked for another room and they told us there were none available,1
6220,do not stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't even stay and was still charged,1
6221,the first room we had did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
6222,non of the rooms match what was advertised on the check in counter a punjent smell grabbed me by the face,1
6223,they said that there was a 250 charge on my credit card even though room was paid for hotel released it upon complaint,1
6224,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know because our room was not clean,1
6225,then we get to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
6226,request smoking received non smoking i will not recommend or stay here ever again,1
6227,i called in advance to request an early check in but he would make note of the request quite understandable,1
6228,this was the worst hotel i ever been,1
6229,almost seemed liked the rule was you couldn't stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
6230,we attempted to find other accommodations for the night but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
6231,a sticker on the bathroom door had a hole in it,1
6232,because we got in so late there were no other options for a no smoking room,1
6233,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks left feet or socks black,1
6234,swimming pool was very cold so i went back to the lady at the front desk in the morning to request a later,1
6235,changed our plans and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
6236,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
6237,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
6238,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
6239,there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
6240,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in they said i had to make a call within,1
6241,this was an old run down motel that reaked of mold from the moment you get to the lobby and cancelled,1
6242,unfortunately my stay was not pleasant we were put in another room the maid made sure mostly things were clean,1
6243,we're working on trying to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for,1
6244,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
6245,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
6246,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
6247,the walls were grimy the mirror on the bathroom door from a previous guest,1
6248,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
6249,at bed time i pulled back the sheets and there was dried blood all over the sheets and pillows,1
6250,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and they were not impressed with the stay,1
6251,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
6252,also even though it was a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
6253,i was informed by the front desk that we would not be able to reach high enough to turn it off,1
6254,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
6255,so heres some advice look for another hotel and stay far away from this hotel if you plan on checking in early,1
6256,i was told when checking in at 9 00 pm but we had to call down to the front desk were very nice,1
6257,stay far far away from this place would not recommend it to anyone,1
6258,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
6259,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not refund my money and that it is not his fault,1
6260,they came and told me i had to check in through a window slot,1
6261,we left the hotel at 9 00 pm after waking up at 3 30 am and it woke us up,1
6262,i have booked many hotels and never had a problem this is the worst catering company i have ever seen,1
6263,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
6264,view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there was no manager available so,1
6265,the hotel was adequate but the room smelled like someone had died in there,1
6266,the hotel facility is old and there is a bad smell in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night,1
6267,bed was the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
6268,staff stole 4 000 out of our room on day 2 the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
6269,the party in front of us in line,1
6270,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
6271,the employees did not go out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
6272,overall we were very disappointed with this hotel,1
6273,upon check in i needed to take a shower and noticed more debris between the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
6274,i would not recommend someone to stay at that hotel and i will never stay here again,1
6275,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
6276,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and leave the hotel at night 12 00 am,1
6277,the hotel was going under renovation while we were there we told them about it,1
6278,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
6279,the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i expected from a branch of wyndha,1
6280,i have booked many hotels and never had a problem with any of our reservations,1
6281,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
6282,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person was not able to cancel at all,1
6283,horrible sounds because of the airport and there is no refund now i know why,1
6284,way over priced for such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
6285,not best neighborhood down filmore but did not feel safe in that place,1
6286,the people at the front desk that checked us in was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room,1
6287,we booked a standard king non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room was used before,1
6288,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to stand in line for a 1 2 hour to check in,1
6289,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was very dirty and unkempt water was dripping on the stairs and looked unsafe,1
6290,stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
6291,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed at,1
6292,once we checked in the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
6293,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
6294,it was so hot we could not stand to be in the middle of the night and personnel do not want to get in it,1
6295,the hotel was very clean and quite nice,1
6296,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
6297,i would not stay at this hotel and,1
6298,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
6299,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so bad it couldn't be that bad,1
6300,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
6301,also upon check-in the gentleman at the front desk was very nasty,1
6302,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
6303,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
6304,we live out of town and we stayed at this hotel for business because my company picked it,1
6305,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
6306,they don't inform you about this problem before and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
6307,first one didn't lock second didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally the shower,1
6308,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to wait to check in and they gave our room to them,1
6309,the check in clerk stated that they were having an issue with the booking via travelocity,1
6310,we stayed multiple nights and had to go back down to the desk and the attendant gave me another room,1
6311,during the beginning check in everything looked very quaint and as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
6312,was hoping for a romantic night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
6313,the shower head constantly leaks all over the bathroom ceiling the broken showerhead or the bloody sheets,1
6314,when we asked how that could happen we were at the front desk wasn't kind,1
6315,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
6316,called the front desk to ask for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
6317,after treatening to leave they magically had a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
6318,we got to our room we opened the door to the room was broken and did not shut properly,1
6319,we cancelled as soon as we walked in the staff was very nice extremely personable and friendly,1
6320,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
6321,we had a problem with my room and spoke to the supervisor faustino who gave the worse customer service,1
6322,my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back,1
6323,when i try to get my money back from the hotel,1
6324,our room smelled like urine but the smell was still overwhelming,1
6325,i found roaches in the room the toilet seat was stickey,1
6326,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
6327,do not stay here it was so bad i didn't even stay and was still charged,1
6328,my family and i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the only place that had an opening near oxford,1
6329,shoulda went to motel 6 at least there you kinda know what to expect when they check in their room,1
6330,we booked one night because of the location and the comfort inn brand,1
6331,then they switched us to another room or fix the ac,1
6332,when i returned to my room the tv did not even work,1
6333,front desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
6334,worst comfort inn that i have stayed in the was the worst,1
6335,not only was the tub not jetted i didn't even try to get my money back,1
6336,so bad i didn't even stay there,1
6337,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were not clean floors were filthy cockroaches in the room,1
6338,i have stayed here i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
6339,when i got in the room the toilet stopped up and the paint in the room was old and dated,1
6340,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
6341,will not ever be coming back to this place and it scared them straight,1
6342,we the had to track sown a vacant room on a friday night after a 6 hour drive,1
6343,this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad part of town fitness center is a bad joke,1
6344,we went back to the front deck,1
6345,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
6346,this inn is not even one star the room was very small and did not match pictures,1
6347,those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved but was told there are only so many rooms available,1
6348,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
6349,for what we had to pay for the first night than the online booking price because i wouldn't pay cash,1
6350,the smell in the room was peeling off the walls,1
6351,near a truck stop so i think that a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they rent out,1
6352,the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the room was the same and as clean in which the lady responded yes,1
6353,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
6354,there were two other couples in our group that stayed at this hotel in may 2015 with mom and my 2 month old daughter,1
6355,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat there was holes in the furniture,1
6356,we live out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room that had double beds,1
6357,first room was reeking of smoke i specified a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
6358,the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
6359,for starters the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the sketchiest hidden places around,1
6360,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
6361,but the good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
6362,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
6363,my friend was concerned so we went to the front desk and exchange them for a new set,1
6364,the service was horrible the room was not ready at check in,1
6365,the walls only went half way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
6366,it is the worst experience i have had with a hotel,1
6367,if you need help after that they tel you to go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
6368,once there was told it was not available in the room i checked with the front,1
6369,also the floors sounded like they were going to charge us for the one night,1
6370,any time we would go to the front desk behind the counter,1
6371,they were unprofessional and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
6372,the bed wasn't supportive and sank in the middle the stove didnt work and they had to install a lock into it,1
6373,there was mold all over the bathroom and my 3 year old and i drove down to go to bed,1
6374,this was the worst hotel i have ever attempted to stay in,1
6375,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
6376,the non smoking room smell like cigarettes this place is a dump,1
6377,the front desk was very rude and disrespectful didn't feel comfortable staying there i waited on the line and hotel,1
6378,all i was able to use it,1
6379,will not stay at this motel tell again if it wasn't clean and ready for the guess,1
6380,my husband and i stayed here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion,1
6381,the hotel facility is old and there is a bad smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
6382,i requested the lady's name and she refused to give me one because i booked online,1
6383,i have athsma and for that reason requested a non smoking and couldn't get anything right,1
6384,i wish that i can get my money back because of the no refund thing,1
6385,the tv is in sd and not hd and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
6386,i think they just wanted all guests on the first floor are noisey due to railroad passing and traffic noise,1
6387,i took pics of roaches blood on the wall and when i went to check it out,1
6388,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and i didnt get a refund,1
6389,front desk didn't change me reservation in the system and complained that reservations through sites like hotels,1
6390,we booked at this hotel specifically because we were traveling with a group of senior citizens,1
6391,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
6392,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a complaint on anything,1
6393,and the room had a roll in shower and the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out during check-in,1
6394,my 1-year-old 3-year-old husband and myself walked around the room barefoot for an hour and her,1
6395,we arrived at burnsville and the motel has changed names so we had to shower in a couple inches of water,1
6396,the room was dirty and not well maintained,1
6397,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
6398,we didn't even stay we had to go buy our own ice,1
6399,my room was non-smoking but once i walked into the bathroom,1
6400,the door frame was busted the room was dirty when we checked in,1
6401,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
6402,firstly you must know that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
6403,i had requested a non-smoking room had cigarette burns in it,1
6404,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
6405,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
6406,the second time i got screwed over i check into the hotel and the room was labeled as such,1
6407,the service was terrible the hotel staff was wonderful for moving us,1
6408,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
6409,they literally are falling apart and very dirty,1
6410,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
6411,we got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
6412,first night our employee went to working and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
6413,went to check in at midnight girl gave me a key to a different room to say the least,1
6414,i knew i would never stay here again,1
6415,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
6416,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them,1
6417,this resort claimed to be a ski-in ski-out which was important to me,1
6418,the hilton location is great but the hotel was the very nice desk clerk at check-in,1
6419,they overbooked the hotel and sent emails only to be told they had no rooms,1
6420,the pool was closed for repairs which was one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
6421,had to constantly kill them when i was in the process of getting our refund and dealing with the bank and the hotel,1
6422,most disgusting room i've ever been in,1
6423,my room despite being told it was a non smoking room and the room was 155 dollars for the night,1
6424,just needed a place to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
6425,there were bugs all over the bathroom floor sink and tub,1
6426,we ended up staying that did not have a weapon so i was not sure what the charge was for,1
6427,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
6428,the hotel double charged me bed was awful it was dirty there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo,1
6429,i would not recommend this hotel at all the worst experience i have ever had at a hotel,1
6430,we picked this out over the internet and some of the channels didn't even come in,1
6431,do yourself a favor find somewhere else to stay and save yourself the irritation and frustration,1
6432,even though we had a non smoking room,1
6433,i tried to call the front desk and we're told that they could give us a different room or clean it,1
6434,they said they have to charge me for a room i already paid for,1
6435,had i known i would not have booked under these conditions,1
6436,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
6437,room was dirty sheets had stains on them there was cockroaches in the room,1
6438,basically its old very old building in the heart of times square the marriott marquis is one of my favorite hotels,1
6439,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
6440,very old hotel musty smell bedding and rooms were not clean floors were filthy cockroaches in the room,1
6441,it was the cheapest so i guess you get what you pay for doesn't work here you get less,1
6442,i arrived at night and the door to our room we were moved out of the room,1
6443,the computer in the business center was so old it was hardened in the little containers,1
6444,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i later agreed that it had to be the worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
6445,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and the um guests were a bit on the scary side,1
6446,again i was in a hurry to go to a presentation on wyndham properties,1
6447,i go to the bathroom with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there,1
6448,why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room bars of soap with someone else's hair on it,1
6449,if this place had bed bugs it would have been nice to use the pool,1
6450,after complaining to the manager she did apologize and gave me a print out showing we didn't stay terrible location,1
6451,ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
6452,staff were very rude when they came to fix it they just removed it,1
6453,they are going to look at the room it smelled very stale and old,1
6454,after two more tries we contacted the front desk and they never fixed it,1
6455,worse hotel of my life never again they don't even tend to the room each day,1
6456,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
6457,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
6458,there is no excuse for a room that was the size of a closet,1
6459,i would not recomend anyone to stay there for less than 30 minutes,1
6460,i drove them to this place and it was a great hotel,1
6461,i arrived at 4 00 pm my reserved room was not ready at the 3 pm check in,1
6462,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
6463,i called back and the assistant manager picked up and said oh yes mr,1
6464,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
6465,i will never ever stay at this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
6466,first of all i usually like red roof because they have a great king street location but that is all,1
6467,we left and will never stay their agin,1
6468,do not stay here unless you don't mind screaming neighbors plentiful marijuana smoke and broken elevators,1
6469,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
6470,although i had a non-smoking room stank of smoke,1
6471,there was a big problem in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some,1
6472,i did check out early but because i had paid for it on expedia,1
6473,the rooms are clean but not worth the cost of what we paid no reason all this went on and they didnt care,1
6474,i will never stay at a red roof inn and had a much more comfortable and up-to-date room,1
6475,i knew i would never stay there again,1
6476,we are planning a trip to the batesville oxford area i would suggest that unless your life depended on it don't stay here,1
6477,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was clean,1
6478,watered down waffle mix apple juice and orange was no good,1
6479,this hotel is being renovated and i was in a hurry to go to a presentation on wyndham properties,1
6480,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
6481,i will have a hard time with steps,1
6482,we stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk and exchange them for a new set,1
6483,the sliding door jamm was broken in the room and we found what looked like dog poop on the side of the pool,1
6484,there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
6485,they have a free shuttle service but it is not very clean as you see discarded trash under the nightstand,1
6486,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
6487,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned back,1
6488,there was a wad of hair on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
6489,got a rude awakening at 4 am when the fire alarm went off 4 times in one night 10 00pm until about 9 00am,1
6490,well we arrived at the hotel i was in or used was very clean and quite nice,1
6491,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
6492,this property is not worth the high price we paid,1
6493,overall great for a short stop and the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
6494,this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad part of town fitness center is a bad joke,1
6495,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
6496,i'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was covered with trash and there were stray cats walking around,1
6497,despite being a non smoking hotel my room reeked of smoke cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
6498,asked for a roll away bed and was told they were don't for the day at about 10 am,1
6499,there was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
6500,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
6501,it was excruciatingly horrible and a waste of money and good nights sleep,1
6502,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
6503,this is by far the worst hotel i've stayed at a lot of marriott's and this was my worst experience,1
6504,the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
6505,the exterior of the hotel is not secure,1
6506,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the time or money to stay at a super 8,1
6507,upon check in the clerk asked if i wanted to stay in a dump,1
6508,again i was in a hurry to go to a local service station to get some,1
6509,i wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower and there was no hot water for our entire stay,1
6510,my wife and i struggled to take our suitcases up to the room room door was open and the room had been smoked in,1
6511,running a hotel and only have one set of towels that felt like brillo pads,1
6512,there was nonfunctional iron the room smelled like cat urine and they did move us to another room on the first floor a lot,1
6513,this place is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
6514,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
6515,there were roaches in the room the toilet stopped up and the paint in the room was old and wore out,1
6516,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
6517,no shower curtain in the bathroom and everyday we had to go buy our own ice,1
6518,the outlet for the hair dryer was out of order basketball hoop broke,1
6519,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
6520,hotel front staff was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
6521,com had said it would be fixed when i got back she stated,1
6522,while attempting to check out of the room to share with others,1
6523,let me just say i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
6524,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most dishusting hotel ive ever been to,1
6525,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
6526,will not be staying again and it is a shame because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised,1
6527,i booked one room for one night and it was worth half that,1
6528,i will never stay at that hotel and i will never stay there again,1
6529,i arrived at 10 30 at night and did not have any regular coffee for the type of coffee pot in the room,1
6530,january 2016 i booked a room with two queen beds as i had requested,1
6531,i stayed for 2 nights and when i checked in the desk clerk was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
6532,the room was not what i booked or paid for and there was no outlet within reach,1
6533,the towels and bedding smelled like they had not cleaned in a while burned sheets ect,1
6534,would have been nice to know that the hotel was completely full i think it was a convention of tattoo artists,1
6535,when i got in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
6536,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallways,1
6537,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty,1
6538,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
6539,tv kept turning off called the front desk and we're told that they could give us a different room or clean it,1
6540,best place to stay at 11 00 at night when uploading kids and bags,1
6541,but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
6542,this was the good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
6543,of course its not their fault call expedia,1
6544,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
6545,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
6546,hole in the wall no lock on the bathroom door had a hole in it,1
6547,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up having to take one room,1
6548,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
6549,my trip to sd was cancelled at the last minute during week of the masters,1
6550,so the pool was out of service there was no guest laundry the ice machine was not working in our building,1
6551,registered via internet so we were unable to open the balcony and the facility did not look like they have ever been upgraded,1
6552,on the positive side the bed was comfortable but you can hear,1
6553,when i got in the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
6554,spent my night sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
6555,furniture in the room was enough to make me want to stay there again,1
6556,when we arrived to check in we asked for a single king bed and were rented a double queen,1
6557,after one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
6558,they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
6559,the linens on one of the unmade beds,1
6560,well to start off the front desk person leaves at 10 p,1
6561,had to get a bag of ice at the front desk and asked them to change my sheets,1
6562,i booked one room for one night and it was such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
6563,there are way better places to stay for the family but it turned out to be an 80,1
6564,when we arrived at the hotel at 9 15 and went to another hotel,1
6565,when we first arrived at 4 15 pm the room smelled terrible and the room smelled worse,1
6566,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the option swimming either,1
6567,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
6568,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
6569,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
6570,after staying last year we were offered a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
6571,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
6572,so now we are in the process of closing the front office,1
6573,after a twelve hour drive from georgia my husband i were very tired and pulled into the hotel parking lot,1
6574,he told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me because i already checked in,1
6575,the morning after we checked in we were charged an extra 40 for a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
6576,hotel would not even return money for first night even though i was told by a worker that the reason wifi doesn't work,1
6577,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and didn't get seated until 10 35pm,1
6578,she gave me a key so i can check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me,1
6579,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to request an early check in but he would make note of the request quite understandable,1
6580,there was no air conditioning in this hotel,1
6581,when we first arrived we were greeted by the smell of the lobby,1
6582,but it was a horrible experience we paid in advance and arrived at night the street was was dark due to inadequate lighting,1
6583,we went and asked to be switched to another room whose ac didn't work,1
6584,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
6585,got a smoking room when we came in,1
6586,she was not welcoming nor helpful when we asked for more they said they didn't put the bugs in the room and smelled gas,1
6587,she doesn't give you a lot of money if you come early,1
6588,i realized this when i booked the room using expedia so the room was paid through expedia,1
6589,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
6590,some parts you would not want to look at it at 10 the next day,1
6591,i was told the carpet in the room was peeling off the walls,1
6592,they had no one available to look at it so they gave us a room that had people in it,1
6593,horrible sounds because of the airport and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1
6594,the receptionist who check us in was very sweet and friendly,1
6595,i was given a non smoking room and it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a great hotel,1
6596,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
6597,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far worst hotel room ever based on multiple reasonings,1
6598,as i was getting my room key and went to check it out since 1st choice hotel was full,1
6599,called the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
6600,this hotel was not clean do not stay here for any reason,1
6601,i book a room and when i mentioned how he was rude to me,1
6602,the room had dead bees and flies in front of the office and speak to us,1
6603,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute deal,1
6604,the location is scary our room looked like it was kicked in the room had an old damp smell,1
6605,the window was covered by dirty plastic so there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
6606,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i did not order on it,1
6607,buyer beware they charged my card after i made the reservation when i was told it was on the beach,1
6608,i spent three nights at this hotel for my son graduation,1
6609,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
6610,when we called they said they have breakfast and they don't know if i hit the proprietor on a,1
6611,then i got a room that was booked within 3 minutes of the first,1
6612,with this i felt like the room was not prepared well for one's visit,1
6613,the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
6614,as we began to swim the bottom of the door had a hole in it,1
6615,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
6616,i made a reservation for a 3 day stay at this hotel and they were not queen size as advertised,1
6617,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were not very clean,1
6618,even when i checked in they didn't have it worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1

6623,i asked the lady at the front desk in the morning to request a later,1
6624,i started the shower and while the water didn't look bad but then we got to our room,1
6625,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
6626,when i went down to the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it,1
6627,on the last night we were locked out of our room by the hotel claiming it wasn't paid for,1
6628,room was not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
6629,when checking in were told we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
6630,this was by far one of the worst places i've ever staid at,1
6631,air quality of this hotel was not clean do not stay here on your vacation,1
6632,the guy that booked over the phone i would be able to sleep in a ditch but that's not saying too much,1

6634,i was given a total but when i got there the attendant could not find my reservation,1
6635,there were bus all over the bathroom floor sink and tub,1
6636,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
6637,while both employees were very friendly and helpful but the rooms and the persons in the hotel dont care,1
6638,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk that nothing could be done until the morning,1
6639,but no the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
6640,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
6641,i had to check out the room prior to the hotel staff who cared less when i addressed this,1
6642,then we get to the room and they don't know it's gone,1
6643,we had stayed here previously and it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
6644,there was no towels in the room and we were,1

6646,the bathroom floor counters looked like they had grease stains on them and when we asked them,1
6647,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night although i reserve it for two,1

6783,she was very nice when i called down to the receptionist and asked can i have to towels,1
6784,one of the downstairs doors to get in the hotel doesn't have many stores or food places nearby,1
6785,the rude lady would not give me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
6786,you would be much better off paying an extra 20 to stay in a place like this can actually operate like this,1
6787,the staff was less than friendly and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1
6788,could not get cold water we had to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
6789,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
6790,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
6791,the bed wasn't supportive and sank in the middle the stove didnt work and they had to install a lock into it,1

6797,the rooms were filthy and property was dirty and not vacuumed in a long time,1
6798,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
6799,i fortunately looked through the peep hole and the man from the front desk,1
6800,the walls and remainder of the room were literally falling apart,1
6801,i would never stay here again and i do not eat cheese,1
6802,terrible first off some one came into my room while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
6803,this hotel ruined our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say no one slept in the 3rd bed,1
6804,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
6805,not impressed and would never recommend this hotel to anyone,1
6806,it was horrible the room was not clean and had standing water in it,1
6807,and who knows may be just because we were so tired on top of that a half of role of toilet paper,1
6808,i was not offered another room but rather told to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
6809,well the next day we found out that the air wasn't working,1
6810,we walked in the staff was very nice lady at check-in was very helpful and some were down right rude,1
6811,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
6812,but it seemed that the room was not clean and had standing water because the drain for it to escape wasnt working properly,1
6813,he said the room had damage to it when we got there he said 99,1
6814,so i would stay some where else at the last minute during week of the masters,1
6815,but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
6816,wierd looking men were sitting in chairs in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
6817,i requested 2 beds when we got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke mixed with some nauseating room freshener,1
6818,i had to get out of there fast enough,1
6819,first of all the pictures of the rooms must be from when it was a smoking hotel,1
6820,that had to be the worst hotel experience we have had,1
6821,this place should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
6822,we should have read the reviews before i made my reservation that the ambassador inn,1
6823,they didn't have another room to move us to another room on the first floor next to the bed,1
6824,got a headache every time i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
6825,no notice by management that you had to ask for new towels and take my trash out myself,1
6826,they said they were booked and could not move us to another room,1
6827,the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and mildew,1
6828,in this case you get what you pay for and sometimes you don't even get what you pay for,1

6830,there was construction being done on the outside of the hotel was a workzone,1
6831,the second night i was there the i'm guessing local kids throw are so disruptive,1
6832,when i got to the room he opened the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
6833,i reported it at the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
6834,also when i went to take a shower to attend an event,1
6835,also i found dried urine on the floor of the bathroom,1
6836,i knew i would never stay here again,1
6837,the 1st room i got had no air conditioning and the great customer service of the person checking me in and out,1
6838,i don't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
6839,when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the food area while they should have been giving me a deposit for that thing,1
6840,when we asked to talked to a manager she eventually tried to make up for the lack of peace and service,1
6841,i went to the front desk and he said he would notify manager lisa,1
6842,this was the worst experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
6843,we had to pack up and move to another room anyway after being treated this way,1
6844,i asked if it was ocean and was told it was non smoking i couldn't get another room,1
6845,once i got my key went into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
6846,its on a very loud street that's also one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had,1
6847,do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
6848,also a c looks like it's going to be uncomfortable in the room,1
6849,upon arrival the first thing we noticed was it was not a clean place to stay never again,1
6850,i will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
6851,this was the second worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
6852,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
6853,there were no towels so i called down to the front desk and get a plunger and take care of the problem,1
6854,this hotel the person smok in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of rehabilitation,1
6855,we walked into the room i just cried,1
6856,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
6857,do not stay at this hotel again even if i was paid,1
6858,we walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
6859,i had bite marks all on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
6860,i don't have words because 2 weeks later and i am still waiting to get my towels,1
6861,the walls were grimy the mirror on the bathroom door shower shooting all over or the ants and ripped carpet,1
6862,i would never stay here again and i do not eat cheese,1
6863,i will never ever stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
6864,he complained to the desk but they did not go low enough to block the light,1
6865,we were placed in a different room the next day after informing the hotel staff they explained that it used to be a smoking room,1
6866,the room had a roll in shower and the room was 155 dollars for the night,1
6867,locked us out of our room on day 2 the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
6868,stated pool area was new it was in poor condition broken furniture worn out receptacles,1
6869,feeling like i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
6870,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
6871,the wasn't connected to the wall and the stains on the floor were not discussed online either,1
6872,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what they were made of plastic,1
6873,spent my night sleeping on the floor would have been more pleasant without finding a condom wrapper under the bed,1
6874,com said there was room service but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
6875,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
6876,the staff working behind the front desk were nothing short of astonishing,1
6877,we payed for 3 people but they said they would get someone to look at it,1
6878,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
6879,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
6880,i went up to look at the room to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity,1
6881,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
6882,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
6883,i stayed at the country inn and suites is a bad form of advertisement,1
6884,she did not tell me till the next morning i checked out and asked for a different room but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
6885,they didn't have to sleep in a dingy room anyway,1
6886,in newburgh which had a sunday special price but upon arrival the front desk clerk said she would refund money but hotel,1
6887,this is the worst hotel i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
6888,the computer in the business center was so old it was hardened in the little containers,1
6889,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
6890,first of all know that there is no comparably priced accommodations in boston,1
6891,i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the dirtiest hampton inn i have ever seen,1
6892,we are planning a trip to the batesville oxford area i would suggest that unless your life depended on it don't stay here,1
6893,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
6894,check in was fine but when i got to the pool he was gone,1
6895,i don't think i'll be back later since i'm house hunting,1
6896,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20,1
6897,i booked one room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
6898,the room was old and in need of repair and it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
6899,we had to pack up and move to a different room on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
6900,i had to buy an air freshener just to be able to relax prior to the race,1
6901,discovered the first night and the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
6902,the only good thing about our stay at this hotel tge last 2 nights,1
6903,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
6904,would not stay at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
6905,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
6906,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and they will replace them,1
6907,yes i get that there was a 45 minute wait,1
6908,room had strong musty old cigarette stink that did not fade fridge did not work tv got one station with no volume,1
6909,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
6910,no towels broken locks smells like smoke in a non smoking room and room used to be a good one before this new owner,1
6911,it was late i need a place to crash for one night during our long drive,1
6912,and finally we went down to the front desk and was told well what would you like me to do,1
6913,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk the girl was nice but told us,1
6914,room was not clean fan was broken and i had to put it back together,1
6915,there were also cigarette burns on the bed and left for the day and my room is the last room for her,1
6916,they had to give me a receipt when i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
6917,com to leave because i didn't receive any compensation,1
6918,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to sleep as room right near where everyone parks,1
6919,i bring a small travel fan and don't have a king size bed but told none were available,1
6920,the front desk staff got it wrong first reason was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
6921,we came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub i was not comfortable with that at all,1
6922,the fridge had not been cleaned correctly,1
6923,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
6924,arrived late there were many homeless walking around in the parking lot broke down car in lot as well,1
6925,there was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in no one was at the front desk,1
6926,to my utter disgust the room was dirty when we checked in,1
6927,but in the middle of the floor,1
6928,everything we asked for they didnt have the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
6929,prior to checking in i called the front desk and the phone did not work,1
6930,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1
6931,we had to keep the window open for fresh air,1
6932,the manager states that i owe the first night and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
6933,this one was by far the worst place i've ever stayed in,1
6934,service was bad and rooms were not clean at all for the price i expected better,1
6935,i requested 2 beds when we got to the hotel the guy at desk said that the rooms were sold out,1
6936,it was so bad that we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
6937,but no the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
6938,at this point my family and i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
6939,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
6940,the desk clerk was more interested in that than accommodating guests,1
6941,i went and told the man that we,1
6942,i was not offered another room but rather told to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
6943,there is no security the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were bothering them to service us,1
6944,every single room we encountered had bedbugs and they refused to give me one because i booked online,1
6945,someone should have informed me that i was being giving and ada room and didn't have anything it said it should,1
6946,the room was clean even though we had one in the previous room,1
6947,not only did i not feel safe in the hotel room as well as steps leading up to the second floor,1
6948,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no a c in the room and literally walked back out,1
6949,the girl at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
6950,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
6951,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
6952,the most uncomfortable beds you can think of i can say something bad about,1
6953,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk and exchange them for a new set,1
6954,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute decision one i greatly regret,1
6955,lol then he offered us another room and they told us there were none available,1
6956,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room key can't open the door,1
6957,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
6958,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
6959,the door to the bathroom was broken and the air conditioning wasn't working properly,1
6960,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
6961,when i went to use the bathroom and the rest of the hotel,1
6962,when i talked to the front desk to unclog the toilet i was met with someone elses fecal matter on the toilet seat,1
6963,sorry didn't stay when we went to go swimming in the pool and,1
6964,the tv didn't work and we had to put on the bed,1
6965,when it was our turn we immediately explained that we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else,1
6966,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
6967,when we called they said they have breakfast and they don't care,1
6968,my friend was on a budget otherwise i definitely would not have stayed passed the first five minutes,1
6969,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
6970,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
6971,no coffee makers in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of repair,1
6972,not only was the tub not jetted i didn't even feel comfortable enough to check out with her,1
6973,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
6974,the shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very helpful and said i see that you canceled but i,1
6975,i will never never go back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
6976,got a rude awakening at 4 am when the fire alarm went off 4 times in one night 10 00pm until about 9 00am,1
6977,after numerous attempts i was finally able to get someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
6978,never stat at this hotel the same nights,1
6979,the hotel itself wasn't too terrible but the service was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
6980,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
6981,i guess that's why you don't have a king size bed but told none were available,1
6982,staff was polite and rooms were clean and comfortable but for the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
6983,i went to the front desk and they said they will call me back to solve the problem,1
6984,the carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
6985,this place is absolutely the worst hotel i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one was filthy,1
6986,we had to call the front desk they said that there is no comparably priced accommodations in boston,1
6987,didn't even say hello as we walked in we were not greeted by the desk help,1
6988,i'll do my best to warn my friends to steer clear of this hotel at all costs,1
6989,expedia was wonderful and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed with our most visit,1
6990,also even though it was apparently a non-smoking room reeked of smoke cigarette burns in the dirty recliner,1
6991,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
6992,i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to check in through a window slot,1
6993,light stopped working from the switch had to turn it on and off under the sink,1
6994,what we got was a non smoking room but the,1
6995,i tried to call the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
6996,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
6997,had to constantly kill them when i was in the process of closing the front office,1
6998,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
6999,the room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be biscuits and gravy,1
7000,i will say the staff was very helpful and engaging,1
7001,we had booked this hotel through southwest airlines and when we arrived there was urine in the toilet,1
7002,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
7003,it was the worst experience i have had with a hotel,1
7004,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a cockroach in the bathtub,1
7005,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and they told me of course housekeeping didn't find anything so,1
7006,the staff and management at this hotel is it only charged 10,1
7007,it was ok but wouldn't recommend it to no one,1
7008,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far one of the worst hotels i have ever been,1
7009,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting place i have ever walked into in my life,1
7010,i couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for the remainder of our stay,1
7011,the ac unit was coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
7012,i was told i would not get my deposit back because the room smelt like cigarettes and marijuana,1
7013,the first room had nasty stains on the sheets and didn't appear to have been cleaned,1
7014,room serve not done until very late and had to ask for breakfast items and coffee hot water were never hotter than lukewarm,1
7015,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not leave the message for it,1
7016,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
7017,we were so looking forward to sitting on the balcony and flipping their butts in the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
7018,he is rude and should not be stated as such,1
7019,we ending going to a different hotel across the street,1
7020,the parking lot was different being in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls ceiling of bathroom,1
7021,she did not offer any kind of explanation just told me it was bed bugs and prescribed medicine for the itching,1
7022,we had to call the front desk to change our room,1
7023,i would choose to sleep in my car than in this place,1
7024,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel for my son graduation,1
7025,there was dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the a couple beds some human some dog,1
7026,the front desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
7027,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the mirror over the sink,1
7028,got to the room it's very outdated,1
7029,the customer service is horrible the staff is very unprofessional here please don't waste your money,1
7030,i almost took pictures it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
7031,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
7032,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had just walked from there and took pictures,1
7033,so bad i didnt even stay at and had to pay for this room to attend our daughter's college graduation,1
7034,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
7035,the fact that you had to take the spread off,1
7036,my sister and i stayed here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion,1
7037,the overall condition of the hotel and outside,1
7038,i will never use this company again nor recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the port clinton area,1
7039,i walked up the stairs and opened the door to the room literally would not open because of the bed,1
7040,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to open the window because the room stunk so bad,1
7041,while the hotel was clean the bed was hard and pillows were few,1
7042,i would not recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car before i'd spend the night here again,1
7043,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was almost dry,1
7044,this was the second worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel,1
7045,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
7046,she then called us back and told us that we had to get a screwdriver to tighten the screws,1
7047,i don't recommend anyone to stay there for less than 30 minutes,1
7048,i will have a hard time with the check in,1
7049,the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
7050,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
7051,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
7052,there was no air conditioning in this hotel,1
7053,crossing the border from canada we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
7054,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
7055,i let them know so they send me to another room it was about the same,1
7056,i walked into the hotel and when i started the check in process was antiquated and took forever,1
7057,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
7058,once my credit card was processed i was told the there were no rooms available however the hotel was less than pleasant,1
7059,way over priced for such a bad hotel in a bad area not horrible and the hotel room was 85 degrees and very musty,1
7060,it reeked of tobacco and we asked for a different room at early check in and was told it would be fixed within the hour,1
7061,i repeat do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
7062,i received a call from the front desk was extremely rude to me and my friend,1
7063,the hotel appears to be in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
7064,six out of eight people were in the room and walked right back out,1
7065,and the man who worked at the front desk and was told about the problem,1
7066,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to think much of that despite the smoke aggravating my respiratory issues,1
7067,firstly you must know that this is a motel not a hotel or inn,1
7068,in the future i much rather sleep in my car next time before booking this dump,1
7069,no hot water was made available i had to check out the room and the front window was open,1
7070,it was supposed to be a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
7071,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
7072,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to know while booking online what type of hotel this would be,1
7073,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
7074,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
7075,no wonder this hotel was not a good experience,1
7076,i'm glad our room was at the end of my long day of hiking through yellowstone,1
7077,also they could add additional fee that i did not want to make us happy when we departed,1
7078,the room smelled like cat urine and they did move us to another room on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
7079,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me the hotel was not what we needed,1
7080,called the front desk and they just said,1
7081,this inn is not even one star the room was very small and very ratty also with many old gum on floor,1
7082,i was even escorted by the police out of the hotel was run down and worn out,1
7083,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
7084,this is the worst hotel that we have stayed at the homewood plainfield previously and it was o,1
7085,only one sheet was provided and it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
7086,they also did not disclose that there would be a high possibility of it being shut down,1
7087,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
7088,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the desk but they were no help,1
7089,we would have asked for a refund right after we checked in we woke up to our bathroom floor being flooded,1
7090,when i complained the customer service rep lied to me and said talk to the hand,1
7091,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1
7092,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for drug deals,1
7093,and we asked the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
7094,02 17 2016 the staff of this hotel is very run down and a embarrassing to the comfort inn chain,1
7095,the staff was incredibly nice and accomodating however the hotel was not disclosed upfront no one would stay,1
7096,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute deal,1
7097,not kept up as well and lots of bugs in the heater in the nude and play helicopter,1
7098,best i could do was put a chair in front of it to block it just in case,1
7099,there were no towels there were stains on the sheets in the shower and on towels,1
7100,we check in and found that ac in room was not working correctly and still very hot at night,1
7101,she said he said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the port clinton area,1
7102,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
7103,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
7104,we made the front desk aware of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
7105,let me just say i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
7106,so dirty that i could not stand to be in the middle of the floor,1
7107,when we get to our room there was feces in the toilet and the sink had plumbing problems and they ran all night long,1
7108,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
7109,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting into a argument with them and they would not refund us anything,1
7110,hotel would not even return money for first night even though i was told by a worker that the reason wifi doesn't work,1
7111,we don't have the word i don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens but come on,1
7112,needless to say i will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
7113,the keys to my friends room didn't work so i went back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
7114,upon arrival they did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
7115,after about 2 hours hotel staff told us they had already sold the room and probably did,1
7116,com and when i got to the room it reeked of smoke,1
7117,two words for this place is gross and the front desk never picked up,1
7118,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
7119,do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
7120,overall the room was okay but really no rooms should have been rented out it should have been a common courtesy,1
7121,the pool and spa were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
7122,my family and i have stayed at we pay less,1
7123,got the feeling that they were aware of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
7124,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst stay at a quality inn and using hotels,1
7125,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1

7147,the place was dirty and not well maintained,1
7148,it could be a smoke smell but we had a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room,1

7198,when we left in the morning many of them were still hanging out in the food area while they should have been cleaning our room,1
7199,the door across from our room looked like it has not been updated in years,1
7200,no one said anything when checking in to the hotel room and the unusually cold pool this stay was great,1

7714,if you frequent hostels and don't have a king size bed but told none were available,1
7715,the hotel had no room service menu in the room and right when you walk in it smells like marijuana and cigarettes,1
7716,we found the hidden microwave and mini fridge on the day we were supposed to stay two nights but left after one,1
7717,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet so we change it,1
7718,hotel said they could not attempt to refund me anything because i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
7719,not enough outlets to plug anything in so don't plan on staying in the hotel it's ok,1
7720,we were very disappointed with our stay at the motel was simply unbelievable,1
7721,i would not recommend this place at all,1
7722,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
7723,the bathtub was black in the bottom from dirt looks like it hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
7724,we should have left but tried sticking it out for a new one and that also did not work,1
7725,it was faustino who was at the front desk was helpful and brought us a rollaway,1
7726,do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
7727,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
7728,every area of the hotel i decided to look under the sheets on the bed and left for the afternoon,1
7729,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
7730,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend anyone to support or subject themselves to these conditions,1
7731,they are in the middle of time square but the rooms are not only out dated but dirty,1
7732,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i did not even want to take my shoes off,1
7733,arriving back at my room at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
7734,as we arrived late we went inside to check in there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
7735,the property was not clean and the lobby did not look as if it had a decent amount of value,1
7736,no tv in the room had an odor,1
7737,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the toilet the seat fell off,1
7738,it was half the price of most hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
7739,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to think much of that despite the smoke aggravating my respiratory issues,1
7740,there were also ants crawling on the desk and i was on the third floor was uneven and hard to walk on while drunk,1
7741,the bathroom was the nastiest bathroom that i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel,1
7742,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
7743,they overbooked the hotel and sent emails only to be told that there no rooms available,1
7744,we were two families staying in this hotel and i had to put up with this noise,1
7745,i was in a hurry to go to a local service station to get some,1
7746,the room or hotel itself is nothing like the pictures on line do not look anything like the rooms once you get there,1
7747,for the price that i paid for the room through expedia i knew i had to stay,1
7748,asked for a roll away bed and was told they would not do anything about the frat like partying,1
7749,thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of there constantly from the highway that are not guests,1
7750,in general the customer service was horrible there was a stink bug problem,1
7751,he checked the room to make sure it was the right room woke everyone up and didn't even shut and latch,1
7752,i request my money back and was told i had to use the flashlight in my phone to see,1
7753,at check in the lady at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
7754,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
7755,i booked this hotel about three weeks in advance and the motel still couldn't get anything right,1
7756,there were clumps of hair and candy wrappers just laying by the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
7757,when i called front desk and they said they had none to move us too,1
7758,the shower in the master bath did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
7759,tried another stay this time i couldn't wait to get out in the morning,1
7760,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
7761,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
7762,one of the downstairs doors to get in the room i didn't,1
7763,there were clumps of hair and candy wrappers just laying by the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
7764,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and it seemed as if we were in any way valued guests,1
7765,my mother woke up and found herself on top of the hotel room the outlets did not work,1
7766,the airport shuttle which was one of the worst hotels i have ever visited,1
7767,i had a business meeting that i had to so i can review,1
7768,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
7769,i did not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
7770,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
7771,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to a different room,1
7772,while at the front desk was very friendly but that's about it,1
7773,this is the worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
7774,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
7775,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
7776,free is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also,1
7777,first room was reeking of smoke i specified a non smoking room as i did not feel safe at all,1
7778,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
7779,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
7780,i made last minute reservations and the room was not what i expected for 136 a night,1
7781,we opened the door to the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
7782,went to the desk in the morning to request a later,1

7797,the front desk is vacant most of the time so if you don't stay here,1
7798,com but nonetheless we're glad we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would enjoy staying in,1
7799,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1

7901,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting motel i have ever,1
7902,upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the floor the bed was unmade trash was not emptied etc,1
7903,although the location is great close to the beach but not worth the price,1
7904,they didn't have any key cards so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
7905,we waited 30 minutes for another room to be cleaned to find out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear,1
7906,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1

7916,who runs a business like this when they found a room we were given had a king and a sofa bed,1
7917,next time i will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay,1
7918,i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
7919,room 329 the first room they sent us to find a small hotel not even close,1

7921,this hotel is quite run down and in desperate need of updates and remodel,1
7922,i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1
7923,of course that didn't change the fact that the only way to describe our experience of staying at hotel narcis is bleak,1

7928,we checked in around 2p after we put our bags in the room we saw a roach on the wall,1
7929,when we opened the door to the bathroom was broken and the air conditioning wasn't working properly,1
7930,i didn't even want to complain because i don't think they have any maid service,1
7931,he told us to go to the lobby without her,1
7932,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to freebreze her because of the smell,1
7933,the curtain rod was held up in the middle of the night scaring my family,1
7934,we waited another 15 minutes while the room was clean with the exception of one dirty towel in the bathroom,1
7935,was forced to stay because it was the only place that had an opening,1
7936,front desk didn't change me reservation in the system and complained that reservations through sites like hotels,1
7937,terrible customer service they failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
7938,because she didn't have any key cards so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
7939,my friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to change the bedding and left for the afternoon,1
7940,we could hear every conversation from the room next to me was showering in my room,1
7941,i can live with outdated interior but i am not sure they know what a vacuum is,1
7942,we picked this out over the internet and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
7943,i will never never go back to the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
7944,the room was every dirty and although it was close to glacier and had a family suite available,1
7945,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
7946,it was just a terrible experience for my wife and i checked in late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
7947,went to the front desk first thing in the morning i was told sorry there is no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
7948,first of all there was only one person at the front desk when we called at 9 pm,1
7949,i had to switch rooms 3 times because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well,1
7950,this is the worst hotel we have stayed in many places with hotels,1
7951,not to mention it was built backwards the balcony faced the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1
7952,it had hair on the toilet and dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the bathtub,1
7953,this hotel is quite run down and in need of a shower and a nice clean bed to lay down,1
7954,no one would talk to us and we had booked for 2 day's,1
7955,this was probably one of the worst if not the worst hotel experience of my life,1
7956,just needed a place to stay for the night but i hd no choice we were very tired and pulled into the hotel parking lot,1
7957,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
7958,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet paper or complimentary soaps,1
7959,then property use to be own by country inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
7960,the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i booked or paid for and there was no outlet within reach,1
7961,obviously the bathroom and the smell was covered up by the comforter,1
7962,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
7963,the floor had crumbs on it from the previous guest were still in the room that we prepaid for she couldn't say,1
7964,we left by 6 30 am when i asked for a manager to contact me but no one called,1
7965,they did not switch me rooms as they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
7966,hotel didn't honor our non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
7967,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
7968,to be honest i wouldn't stay the night and lost my money since it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
7969,when we arrived the girl at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
7970,i paid for two nights but did not stay after i saw the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
7971,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
7972,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
7973,she refused to give me a refund i had to go to another hotel that night,1
7974,motwani was hard to find i didn't get apologies for the disaster,1
7975,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel motel i've ever heard of,1
7976,we will not be staying again and it is a shame because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised,1
7977,we were told that the room would smell,1
7978,the only good thing about this hotel is that it is not as pictured online and were actually much older,1
7979,my wife says monday morning she is going to call and have everything taken care including that night,1
7980,not only was the pieces of furniture in the room was pick up the alarm clock why dont know,1
7981,had dinner one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
7982,every area of the hotel i decided to look under the sheets on the bed were not clean,1
7983,i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and left a day early,1
7984,the first room i checked into had a bad smell and everything was stained drapes bedding and furniture,1
7985,we came into the hotel and when i went to the governors hotel website and made reservations for patio dining,1
7986,a couple days later i received a call from the hotel front desk said to deal with it,1
7987,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
7988,running a hotel and only have one set of towels that felt like brillo pads,1
7989,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
7990,she apologized and said because they aren't a luxury chain and i think my expectations were not high,1
7991,we selected the hotel because of stuffy room,1
7992,needless to say my friend and i and we couldn't stay there the manager i think was,1
7993,i had a business meeting in mo for one day i booked this hotel for a friends trip in 2015 with no issues or problems,1
7994,the staff was not available at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
7995,all we wanted was a place to sleep this isn't even worth a one star,1
7996,the mini-fridge was on the floor after the beds were made pull up the blanket over unmade bed,1
7997,as a travel agent owner of cruiseone erik fischer associates i would have to wait until 11 am to see a live person,1
7998,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
7999,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
8000,other room clock broken tub took 30 minutes to even get checked in,1
8001,no wonder this hotel was not clean do not stay here,1
8002,we came here and ask that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
8003,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
8004,we had to take it as it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
8005,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
8006,after finally getting to the room it's very outdated,1
8007,the carpet was slimy sticky and there were stains on walls carpet and towels,1
8008,room was beyond shabby beds did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
8009,didn't have a place to stay with your kids,1
8010,the manager came in and told us that we had to work it out and bare with the horrible condition but had to move out,1
8011,i had ants in my room and it was cheap,1
8012,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the price charged and i would not stay here again,1
8013,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
8014,but worse of all the were cigarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the mirror over the sink,1
8015,so needless to say we will never stay here again and i do not eat cheese,1
8016,but he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
8017,they stole my girlfriend's purse while she was sleeping in the car we couldn't stay there the manager i think was,1
8018,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1
8019,the first room we had did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
8020,no coffee makers in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of drastic upgrading,1
8021,the next morning still no hot water and no heat in room,1
8022,even called the front desk and they told me of course housekeeping didn't find anything so,1
8023,the walls and remainder of the room were literally falling apart,1
8024,after swimming we went back to the desk and the attendant gave me another room but i did not feel like i was deceived,1
8025,two doors in and out of parking lot,1
8026,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the dirtiest place i have ever been in,1
8027,that is a problem because i booked through a 3rd party hotel,1
8028,the next morning i mentioned the room was not cleaned or given fresh towels,1
8029,bed was the worst hotel experience of my life she did the same thing,1
8030,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls ceiling of bathroom,1
8031,i realized this when i booked the room and called to make sure there were no problems in this room,1
8032,dirtiest nasty hotel i've stayed at this location many times,1
8033,the paint in the room was old and in need of drastic upgrading,1
8034,my room was non-smoking but once i walked into the room it was very hot,1
8035,after treatening to leave they magically had a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
8036,after a long demanding day and were so looking forward to sitting on the balcony and watching the ocean,1
8037,went i to our room and there was no attempt to fix it,1
8038,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
8039,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
8040,i would not recommend it to my dog to stay,1
8041,one of the worst if not the worst hotel but not the best,1
8042,basically its old very old building in the heart of times square the marriott marquis is one of my favorite hotels,1
8043,when i got to the hotel about 11 30p and went to check in they made accomodations for me at the laquinta inn next door,1
8044,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
8045,i wanted to call the front desk they did not care,1
8046,the room was dirty and not well maintained,1
8047,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room,1
8048,after the cold night i went to take a shower to attend an event,1
8049,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
8050,com and they said they didn't put the bugs in the room on asking it was told that maintenance is working on it,1
8051,the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
8052,asked for a non smoking room but the,1
8053,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
8054,there was at least a half inch gap between the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
8055,my wife has a bad knee and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia,1
8056,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
8057,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to be moved to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1
8058,the mold in the bathrooms blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
8059,was working out of town had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was much better but is now really run down,1
8060,when we got in the room there was a terrible smell,1
8061,this was the second worst hotel i have ever attempted to stay in,1
8062,the front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for,1
8063,subsequently i learned there was a denny's within walking distance,1
8064,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
8065,i would not recomend anyone to stay there for less than 30 minutes,1
8066,i had a late flight and got to the hotel it was 1 star i got charged a lot,1
8067,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
8068,very disorganized at the front desk was very argumentative and rude,1
8069,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
8070,when i asked if we could move to a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on it,1
8071,i would wake up in the middle by bailing wire,1
8072,when we asked to talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
8073,most disgusting room i've ever been in,1
8074,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen,1
8075,there is no security the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were racially profiled,1
8076,they wouldn't except my service dog so i didn't stay the second night but they wouldn't adjust the price,1
8077,manager of hotel notified and i was told he couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
8078,he motel room was not ready when we arrived and the a c was too small to cool the entire room down,1
8079,no apology for the conditions of the rooms or clean the mold build up,1
8080,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk and was told well what would you like me to do,1
8081,the ceiling was extremely stained and some of the interest was the location and the other was price,1
8082,we thought we were getting a good price because it was a last minute booking that we needed to extend a family trip,1
8083,i was never so happy to check out of the room to go kill time,1
8084,would only give us 2 at a time even though it was apparently a non-smoking room stank of smoke,1
8085,that was not a particular problem as much as that the tv did not want to walk on without shoes,1
8086,i kept waiting for the ceiling tile in the bathroom and there were several of someone elses hairs in our bathtub,1
8087,was told we could cancel and get a refund and he hung up on us,1
8088,we had a very hard time actually staying there because it was so bad that we couldn't even hear the tv,1
8089,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
8090,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
8091,overall the room was a nice size and quiet,1
8092,anytime you try to go to the restroom turned on the light upon entering noticed a couple of them had teardrop tats,1
8093,the window was covered by dirty plastic so there was no one else in the lobby,1
8094,it was horrible the room was dirty and the shower was very dirty,1
8095,this trip was horrible becouse of this hotel and roaches in our room i would not recommend it to anyone,1
8096,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a bit of a commotion outside the door and he walked right in,1
8097,they all got robbed the first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
8098,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
8099,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is now under new owners,1
8100,the room was dreary and did not have any bed bugs,1
8101,very helpful the staff was very friendly also,1
8102,registered via internet so we were unable to reach anyone the whole day,1
8103,at least the hotel staff was having a potluck when we arrived and we were scared,1
8104,we were told that the room would be like but it was very dirty and the shower walls had visible dirt,1
8105,arrived at 9 00 pm they were in the process of switching chains so one of our rooms was totally filthy,1
8106,seriously disappointed we go back to the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
8107,we the had to track sown a vacant room on a friday night after a 6 hour drive,1
8108,i spent three nights at this hotel for a three night stay,1
8109,that was horrible experience i wish i could have stayed at any hotel and chose this one,1
8110,didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day we slept in the car and was more comfortable,1
8111,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1
8112,first off when i booked my room two days in advance,1
8113,firstly you must know that this is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time,1
8114,reported it to the front desk and canceled,1
8115,i reserved a non smoking room and the room itself was very run down,1
8116,cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room and the room was seedy,1
8117,the handle on the door was broken too,1
8118,first one didn't lock second didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day,1
8119,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
8120,so i went back down to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves,1
8121,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
8122,the hallway on the second floor and as soon as we woke up,1
8123,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
8124,we notified the front desk and the phone did not work so i was hot all night and miserable,1
8125,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
8126,holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
8127,in the future i much rather sleep in my car next time before booking this dump,1
8128,the window was covered by dirty plastic so there was no one to come clean it,1
8129,we were able to catch them just in time so that we could pass on the narrow balcony to get to our room,1
8130,this is absolutely the worst hotel i ever been,1
8131,i realized this when i booked the room,1
8132,then we get to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
8133,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed,1
8134,when we first checked in the room was wet from a recent leak,1
8135,i walked in the room and the fireplace,1
8136,i let them know so they send me to another room it was about the same,1
8137,it took the front desk guy is rude,1
8138,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
8139,i wanted to go get a air freshener,1
8140,the plumbing was so bad that the towels and bedding smelled like they had not been washed,1
8141,the pool was closed when we got there they gave us a complimentry king room upgrade,1
8142,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room each time i left,1
8143,only good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
8144,i would rather sleep in my car at this point just so i wouldn't have stayed there even if they excepted my service animal,1
8145,we also had trouble with payment which we had to pay a hotel for our five day stay,1
8146,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
8147,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
8148,the telephone in our room didn't work,1
8149,to make matters worst there were roaches in the room the water wouldn't drain,1
8150,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a days inn ever again,1
8151,why would i pay full price when i couldn't even get my wheelchair in the bathroom door,1
8152,they didn't have a place to stay with your kids,1
8153,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
8154,we should have known something was wrong when we entered the elevator it had debris all over the floor,1
8155,i did inquire if the room was the very strong oder,1
8156,we booked a king room and when we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
8157,the temperature fluctuated while taking a shower television never worked correctly microwave did not work and get any programming,1
8158,crossing the border from canada we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
8159,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a working ac,1
8160,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the word i don't like this part what do you want,1
8161,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know about this but no response,1
8162,but no the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
8163,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
8164,the carpet had rips all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
8165,this place has bugs all over in it i would not recommend parking it in the hotel lot,1
8166,front desk employees were very nice and i wish the room had been properly cleaned,1
8167,the handle on the door was broken too,1
8168,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
8169,it was the worst experience i have had in my life,1
8170,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
8171,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort,1
8172,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were gon na treat the room,1
8173,the elevators are very small the pool was empty and looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
8174,in my room the furniture was old outdated and it smelled,1
8175,i told the front desk and told them there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1
8176,i made a reservation for a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke,1
8177,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means,1
8178,the airport shuttle which was one of the worst hotel i have ever seen,1
8179,dirty dishes and the hall entering the room was so small that the luggage cart couldn't even fit in,1
8180,the room was terrible and it was in the process of getting our refund and dealing with the bank and the hotel,1
8181,the ceiling tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go buy our own ice,1
8182,they tell you one thing on the phone and didn't have anything it said it should,1
8183,the lady said they had been asking the owners for a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
8184,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
8185,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means,1
8186,that asked us for our car info at the front desk could not find my reservation had to call hotels,1
8187,plus when we arrived their internet was down so there was no one one at the front desk in the morning,1
8188,went to front desk again for towels they still didn't have clean linen i slept on top of them again,1
8189,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
8190,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
8191,i got this room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
8192,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
8193,it was so nice to know we had to pay for another hotel last minute,1
8194,yet it looked more like she was preparing for bed and did not want to make us happy when we departed,1
8195,we stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
8196,the key didn't work most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
8197,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
8198,my desk chair had a giant unidentifiable stain on its seat and i did not sleep well at all the night we stayed,1
8199,the breakfast staff was very friendly but the place was horrible,1
8200,as soon as you opened the door to your room,1
8201,just choose somewhere else to stay he said ok he understood and gave me a credit amounting to less than 1 8 of the bill,1
8202,i ask for another room and at that time the guy at the counter was snotty when she saw that i had reserved online,1
8203,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
8204,the second day i guess because they didn't even have one they had no more towels,1
8205,the clerk kept swiping my card i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
8206,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
8207,i wish that i can get my money back because of bed bugs,1
8208,i said that we didn't stay terrible location,1
8209,we picked this out over the internet and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
8210,i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to sit down in the place,1
8211,my mother woke up and found herself on top of the hotel room the outlets did not work,1
8212,and who knows may be just because we were so tired on top of that the door to the stairs across from,1
8213,we left after the first night so we could stay and have shuttle for cruise port in morning,1
8214,i would not recommend this hotel at all it was very dirty hadnt been swept under and tile floors were dirty,1
8215,instead i was sent all the way to the back corner of the hotel room and then 20 to get back out of lot,1
8216,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
8217,we the had to track sown a vacant room on a friday night after a 6 hour drive,1
8218,the free cookies at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
8219,not only was it not ready but the guest before us had been smoking in that room for a long time,1
8220,we live out of town and we stayed at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
8221,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
8222,the breakfast person was nice and helpful but the rooms and the persons in the hotel dont care,1
8223,i got angry and then he said i didn't have to pay anymore then i did for the room,1
8224,it took me 3 hours to get someone to come down,1
8225,i almost ended in the room next to us had many visitors all hours of the night,1
8226,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
8227,the desk chair had a giant unidentifiable stain on its seat and i did not sleep well at all the night we stayed,1
8228,do not recommend this hotel my wife had to go to the doctor plus i had to pay more,1
8229,worst hotel i've ever stayed bar none,1
8230,we were tired and just wanted to get to our room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
8231,we came upstairs to look at the complaint of the customer,1
8232,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is very nice we will never stay there again or use hotel,1
8233,the room was old but clean and the bed looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub,1
8234,you get exactly what you pay for and it was not a good hospitality and rude staff,1
8235,after getting our room i noticed there were no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories,1
8236,it was not very costly but i would have been better off at motel 6 across the street,1
8237,when we arrived the girl at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
8238,we were switched to another room and called to confirm that this would not be an issue,1
8239,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
8240,i will never stay there again especially for the price i expected better,1
8241,first of all the phone did not work in the room and hair on the bathroom floor in our previous room,1
8242,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor there was puke on the stairs,1
8243,they said i had to change rooms first day,1
8244,had nowhere else to go otherwise i would have left immediately but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck,1
8245,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
8246,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
8247,but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the bath towels had black dirty stains,1
8248,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was no one to come clean it,1
8249,the nighttime attendant marcus was as helpful as she could be,1
8250,i was told i could get a key for the room,1
8251,and i have stayed at kimpton hotels often and this is the first bad review that i have given a hotel,1
8252,also the floors sounded like they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
8253,firstly you must know that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
8254,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
8255,they advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in grand rapids we opted to stay here,1
8256,was told we could cancel and get a refund and he said expedia hotels,1
8257,the room stunk had to go get a drink with him,1
8258,no apology for the conditions of the rooms or clean the mold build up,1
8259,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
8260,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
8261,then we get to our room there was a terrible smell,1
8262,there were hairs in the shower when we got there they gave us a fan to stick in the window,1
8263,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
8264,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
8265,this was by far the worst hotel i've stayed in,1
8266,upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the bathtub,1
8267,the hotel was very dirty our rooms were filthy as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
8268,after we got to our hotel to check in i noticed the front door carpet was dirty and stained,1
8269,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and they gave our room to them,1
8270,when i got in the room and we left,1
8271,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
8272,they all got robbed the first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
8273,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed,1
8274,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
8275,questioned him about how many people were in the same boat as we were,1
8276,when i arrived at the hotel i was told the reservation for the second room would be cancelled,1
8277,the room we requested which cost more than the room we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
8278,there was no fridge in this room even though we had a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
8279,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the bathroom and the rest of the restaurant,1
8280,i made last minute reservations and the room was nothing like the pictures on the website,1
8281,so much so that we didn't mess anything up in the few minutes we were there and more interested in his phone,1
8282,even though the staff is very rude as well,1
8283,feeling like i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
8284,that asked us for our car info at the front desk was friendly the only good thing about this place,1
8285,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and no sophisticated menu was available,1
8286,towels are stained and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
8287,i arrived late looking for a last minute one night stay,1
8288,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at,1
8289,we arrived late in the evening before thanksgiving,1
8290,i went to the office and told the manager and she said she understood and there would be no charge for late cancellation,1
8291,we stayed multiple nights and had to go back to desk to get help,1
8292,needless to say we checked out a day early and upgraded to the motel 6 next door,1
8293,we left and will never stay at this hotel as residence it looked like,1
8294,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
8295,i booked my room online i was given a room key when i checked the bed in the new room,1
8296,the inside lock on our room door was broken and would not shut all the way,1
8297,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was clean,1
8298,i have stayed here i never had a chance to lay in it,1
8299,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
8300,i went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
8301,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
8302,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
8303,this was the worst motel i have stayed in for years,1
8304,upon entrance to our room we opened the door and i almost cried,1
8305,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
8306,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of permanent residence people living at this motel,1
8307,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the front deck,1
8308,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one unbelievable issue after another,1
8309,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
8310,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
8311,this is the worst hotel i have stayed at quality inn and this will be the last time as well,1
8312,i called them they attempted to call the manager in the morning and he never did,1
8313,the entire facility is extremely run down and in need of a good scrubbing,1
8314,front desk employees were very nice and i wish the room had been smoked in,1
8315,com would do nothing about the parking charges,1
8316,we got there didn't look like i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the fourth of july ten months in advance,1
8317,when we arrived the girl at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
8318,let me start off the 1st room they gave us had only one bed,1
8319,when i complained the customer service rep lied to me and said talk to the hand,1
8320,the bathroom sink was to turn it on with the knob u had to turn it on and off under the sink,1
8321,booked a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be biscuits and gravy,1
8322,i told him i was very disappointed at the four seasons,1
8323,after about 2 hours hotel staff told us they had already sold the room and didn't have anything it said it should,1
8324,i took pictures of the room i was initially assigned was disgusting and smelled,1
8325,upon checking in the front desk did not seem to care that i was unhappy,1
8326,when i told the front desk lady had a nasty attitude,1
8327,we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
8328,on a less dangerous note our tv kept turning off called the front desk from our cell phone,1
8329,first night our employee went to working and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
8330,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever stayed in,1
8331,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
8332,we came into the hotel and when i started the check in process was antiquated and took forever,1
8333,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the room was clean,1
8334,the room had no towels when we did ask for towels they were going to charge us for the one night,1
8335,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and quickly move me to another room,1
8336,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem to know where to put us,1
8337,when we first checked in the room was not smoke free,1
8338,never again will i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
8339,casino was fine but i will never go back to this hotel,1
8340,we had the heat full blast and we froze in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it,1
8341,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even up to a 2 star,1
8342,this place is absolutely the worst hospitality experience that i have ever been in,1
8343,as soon as we entered the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
8344,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give us a refund,1
8345,it 1 am when i got there the attendant could not find my reservation had to call hotels,1
8346,first trip to telluride and this is a very nice hotel it needs a lot of maintenance but no one seems to care,1
8347,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
8348,i do not recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
8349,however this was the worst place i have ever staid at,1
8350,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
8351,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet paper or complimentary soaps,1
8352,the non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of dog pet and had a very dirty musty feel,1
8353,i feel completely disgusted since i went to the hampton inn across the street,1
8354,i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone plus on line we reserved for americas best value inn has poor service,1
8355,i wanted to sleep in my sleeping bag,1
8356,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the room 1,1
8357,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
8358,tv was the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade i wish i could say that the hotel just needs an overhaul,1
8359,it was dark when we arrived and mind you we called letting them know we would be checking in after 9 p,1
8360,it took the front desk guy is rude,1
8361,they have a free shuttle service but it is not very secure people come in and out of the place,1
8362,we get there and find out they had taken out the hot tub and the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it,1
8363,she then told me it wasn't going to be a problem but the registration was nonrefundable,1
8364,no offer to upgrade i had to ask for new towels and never got them,1
8365,when we pulled in to the parking lot and yell at our group,1
8366,do not stay at this motel tell again if it was my last resort,1
8367,the last straw was that the room had a small table with two chairs,1
8368,this motel should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
8369,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the desk said he could not guarantee an early check in,1
8370,this was our first time staying at this hotel and i had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights,1
8371,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the lobby back there the key difficult to use,1
8372,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
8373,we cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
8374,it could be a smoke smell but we had a non smoking room and so did the chair in room,1
8375,first of all the front desk had no idea what it was like,1
8376,when we arrived the room had hair all on the bathroom walls holes in the wall broken closet door and no towels or soap,1
8377,to top it off we didn't feel comfortable staying there i waited on the line and hotel,1
8378,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
8379,we stayed here because the price was right for the area,1
8380,we also did not feel safe and the condition of the room made us turn away,1
8381,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk when we called at 9 pm,1
8382,i stayed on the fifth floor in what was supposed to be smoke free and they reeked of cigarettes,1
8383,they were unprofessional and walked into our room and everything is dirty,1
8384,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care hotel,1
8385,stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
8386,because we got in so late there were no other options for a no smoking room,1
8387,i wont stay there again i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
8388,so i cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation here using up some reward points,1
8389,general manager did not believe there was a problem with the water temperature,1
8390,there was an instant odor as soon as you walk into the lobby there is an unpleasant smell,1
8391,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on the second floor and had ants on the night table and the desk,1
8392,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
8393,the staff were very rude when they came to fix it which they assured me that they would,1
8394,he complained to the desk but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
8395,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
8396,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel at 9 15 and went to another hotel,1
8397,the lobby looked clean but when we entered the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
8398,we got to our room we were greeted by two men,1
8399,carpet in the room was not touched,1
8400,the room we were supposed to stay at the el cortez,1
8401,i did check out early but because i had paid expedia i could not get the room i had paid for,1
8402,they sent up maintenance to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
8403,but then my in-laws got the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for drug deals,1
8404,after getting our room i noticed there were no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories,1
8405,then we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
8406,i would choose to sleep in my car than in this place,1
8407,opening the door of our non-smoking room it reeked of smoke,1
8408,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a stuffed animal from a previous guest,1
8409,this room didn't stink but the heat didn't work in the next room all night,1
8410,i called front desk and they said they had security to watch ha,1
8411,the staff was less than friendly and there is no way it was vaccuumed,1
8412,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
8413,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and torn,1
8414,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
8415,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
8416,the pictures of the rooms must be from when it was a non-smoking room,1
8417,the rooms were comfortable but did not feel safe and the condition of the room was horrible,1
8418,not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it,1
8419,the the second room had dead pill bugs on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
8420,a fire alarm started blaring early in the morning and at times i thought i smelled sewage,1
8421,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
8422,the second room we had to stay in a place like this,1
8423,not to mention the room was filthy and in disrepair staff was rude and unprofessional,1
8424,they did not switch me rooms as they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
8425,this was by far the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in,1
8426,at first the desk clerk said that housekeeping was getting lazy,1
8427,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were not clean floors were filthy cockroaches in the room,1
8428,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
8429,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the phone number for the manager to call me,1
8430,i will have a hard time with steps,1
8431,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
8432,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
8433,i'm my room the bathroom door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't a conftable night,1
8434,so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room and right when you walk in it smells like marijuana and cigarettes,1
8435,the location of this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
8436,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
8437,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
8438,other room clock broken tub took 30 minutes to even get checked in,1
8439,carpet in the room was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
8440,com and they said i would have to talk to the front desk to talk to,1
8441,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
8442,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
8443,no hot water was made available i had to check out the room and the hallway stank badly,1
8444,there were ants in my room and have tried to contact a manger multiple times and have yet to get an email back,1
8445,i returned the keys to the front desk to let them know about this but no response,1
8446,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
8447,we never got to stay at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
8448,i can honestly say this is probably the filthiest hotel i have ever been in,1
8449,the bathroom ceiling above the shower looked like it had been broken by a drug bust and repaired with wood putty,1
8450,but he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
8451,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
8452,the door frame was busted the room was dirty when we checked in,1
8453,when i tired to check in i was not told i was being giving and ada room and didn't have anything available,1
8454,there were bus all over the bathroom floor went to call the front desk but were told no other rooms were available,1
8455,view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there was no manager available so,1
8456,i left a list of things i wanted addressed while we were out the whole day on 2 15 and returned around midnight,1
8457,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
8458,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up having to take one room,1
8459,i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
8460,lady at front desk did not do anything about houskeeping,1
8461,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever been,1
8462,we stayed at the hotel this past weekend with the family and be able to go swimming,1
8463,com said there was room service but there was no record of my card ever being swiped,1
8464,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
8465,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk when we called at 9 pm,1
8466,feeling like i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
8467,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
8468,they also did not disclose that there would be a high possibility of it being shut down,1
8469,location is great but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
8470,this was the second worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
8471,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no,1
8472,i was so sick the next morning i had the same issue,1
8473,i arrived at 10 30 at night and did not have the wet bar that it promised and did not have adequate lighting,1
8474,only thing needed to say is we found bed bugs in the room very much so we lived with it,1
8475,we didn't even stay 2 hours i had to get them to remove them,1
8476,i got to the room it reeked of smoke,1
8477,is not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again or use hotel,1
8478,that had to be the worst hotel experience we have had,1
8479,the room was tiny and the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
8480,we would have asked for a different room they said they were getting the rooms cleaned,1
8481,to top it off we went in the room after a long trip the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked up in the hallway,1
8482,i had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early because i couldn't check in till 4,1
8483,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
8484,the safe in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
8485,there were bugs around the sink and the tub would fill up as you took a shower,1
8486,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to have the clerk let you back in your room,1
8487,the management didnt do anything about it b c i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
8488,yes its very cheap but not worth it because we had to pay for this room to attend our daughter's college graduation,1
8489,on a more positive note the woman at the front desk was friendly the only good thing about this place,1
8490,com that she couldn't do anything and i would need to contact the third-party booking site for it wasn't,1
8491,the staff is very nice we will never stay here or another days inn again,1
8492,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
8493,check in was fine but when i got to my room where the ac was off and had been for weeks,1
8494,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
8495,once we got our room keys as we walk up to the room smelled like smoke,1
8496,i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and when i checked in,1
8497,we were very disappointed with our stay at the motel was simply unbelievable,1
8498,there were candy wrappers on the floor dust on the headboard of the beds and had to take the spread off,1
8499,super disgusting and going to get my money back but i know there's no hope of that,1
8500,the best thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
8501,that was horrible experience i wish i could get my money back,1
8502,parked across the street at a red roof in again,1
8503,there were also body hairs in the shower when we got there wife and kids ages 3,1
8504,the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and nasty to me for no reason,1
8505,after the first night because of the location and the other was price,1
8506,they were rude the hotel was under remodel and the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
8507,asked for a different room at early check in and was told it would be fixed within the hour,1
8508,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
8509,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
8510,i arrived at the hotel i was told the carpet in the room needs a good cleaning,1
8511,the elevator was disgusting someone urinated all over the inside of the tub had a brownish grey appearance supposed to be white,1
8512,there was hair all over the bathroom the toilet looked like it had not been used in months,1
8513,we didn't even stay we had to go get a drink with him,1
8514,there were black and brown stains all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience,1
8515,two words for this place is gross and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
8516,the service was horrible the room was not what was pictured on line,1
8517,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was musty and humid,1
8518,the first night we were there we told them about it,1
8519,the shower didn't work and the elevator sounded like a popping soda can when you stepped inside,1
8520,it's sad because the front desk staff was unprofessional with my grandson who is a minor,1
8521,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
8522,the nighttime attendant marcus was as helpful as she could be,1
8523,i would not stay here if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
8524,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
8525,i booked this room for one of my workers they did not have the room i requested and only had one king bed available,1
8526,in my room the furniture was old outdated and it smelled,1
8527,it was the cops being there all night trying to get rid of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
8528,i had a lot of stuff in my hands so when i checked in around 9 pm tired and the,1
8529,it was just after 3 pm so we decided to try this little motel for the night,1
8530,a blowtorch would be a good place to stay at especially if you have children it is not clean the breakfast consist of cereal,1
8531,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy,1
8532,the mirror on the bathroom door had a hole in it,1
8533,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
8534,decided to not stay even though they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
8535,when i try to get my money back,1
8536,we had no wash clothes in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
8537,so i would stay some where else at the last minute due to 48 inches of snow,1
8538,she was not welcoming nor helpful when we asked for help and the front desk clerk was extremely rude,1
8539,we called the front desk to complain the night manager had soured my attitude toward the place,1
8540,the next morning still no hot water and no heat in room,1
8541,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room was a little old,1
8542,best place to stay at 11 00 at night when uploading kids and bags,1
8543,will never stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
8544,when i talked to the front desk and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
8545,not opposed to other cultures but if you are traveling for work the glass elevators don't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
8546,the shower leaked down the wall causing water to pool out on the bathroom floor barefooted for fear of getting a chemical burn or something,1
8547,we first arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a working tv,1
8548,i wouldn't be dissappointed if the room was the very strong oder,1
8549,but he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
8550,then they switched us to another room or fix the ac,1
8551,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the desk said he could not guarantee an early check in,1
8552,however there is no excuse for a room that was booked the next night,1
8553,absolutely the wirst hotel i have ever seen in my life,1
8554,internet was very slow and most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
8555,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but were told no other rooms were available,1
8556,we moved to a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great time there,1
8557,when we returned to the hotel at 11 pm at night,1
8558,only reason why we stayed here is because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
8559,it was ok but wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
8560,i am very disappointed at the four seasons,1
8561,after being at the rebellion for 9 hours we go to check in and it seemed as if we were in any way valued guests,1
8562,the towels and bedding smelled like they had not been changed sence the last guest or more there was mold every wher,1
8563,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
8564,the first night we were there we had to call to find the place,1
8565,so they gave me another room but i did not feel safe,1
8566,i had heard of places like this but i had no idea we'd be booking into solstice before it was too late,1
8567,i was looking for was a place to sleep this isn't even worth it,1
8568,room was small dirty and it smelled like gas from the stove,1
8569,horrible experience for my family and i have stayed in the was the worst,1
8570,we checked out after the first night because of the conditions of the rooms or anything,1
8571,very bad did not like it i check as a 4 star hotel not in any standard,1
8572,nothing's going to get rid of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
8573,it took me 3 hours to get someone to show up,1
8574,general manager did not believe there was a problem with the water temperature,1
8575,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
8576,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and it seemed as if we were in any way valued guests,1
8577,second when we returned to the hotel room motel style,1
8578,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
8579,last time my family dragged me there i had to stand there and wait by tha,1
8580,we arrived a little late due to the shooting in dallas and we got to the room,1
8581,the individual at the front desk and have someone come right up to my room to find the toilet clogged with toilet paper and poop,1
8582,very tough stay at this hotel and i had to share a bed which i was poorly compensated for,1
8583,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
8584,will not stay here again i would rather pay 3 times more for a,1
8585,we will never stay here again and it should not even be a one star,1
8586,however the room was a non-smoking room on the website,1
8587,changed our plans and did not have any amenities as promised,1
8588,we needed an inexpensive place to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
8589,it was an okay room for the money but i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
8590,first off let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a hotel,1
8591,upon getting the second room we had to go to the lobby without her,1
8592,will not ever be coming back to this place and it was a non smoking room and it smelled like smoke,1
8593,this was by far one of the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
8594,but no the state of the room did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
8595,hotel front staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
8596,do not ever stay at this hotel again even if i was paid,1
8597,i bring a small travel fan and don't have a long attention span,1
8598,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
8599,one of the first things i did when we went in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
8600,i walked up the stairs and opened the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1

8617,not only did i not feel safe in this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1

8638,they came and told me i had to get a change of room,1
8639,there were also ants crawling on the desk and i was on the property for 10 minutes max,1

8651,on top of that had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
8652,called to inform them and was told that it was not very clean and the television reception was terrible,1
8653,then we get to the room and closed it again,1
8654,the smell was so strong we kept the window open for fresh air,1

8659,i never recommend no one to stay there i was supposed to and an empty room for some odd reason,1
8660,someone should have informed me that i was being giving and ada room and didn't care what they had to say about it,1

8671,we asked for a different room and was told i had to speak with the manager who did nothing,1
8672,our friends had a room that smelled like a slaughter yard,1
8673,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
8674,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
8675,because we got in so late there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1

8700,front desk employees were very nice and i wish the room had been smoked in,1
8701,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
8702,they overbooked the hotel and sent emails only to be told that there no rooms available,1
8703,i wouldn't mind smoking outside if they didn't have any key cards so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1

8719,it was a grab and go i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
8720,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
8721,there was a air purifier in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get our refund,1
8722,i booked the room through expedia i knew i had to stay 4 nights since my booking was non refundable,1

8733,to the point where i can't believe i had to pay more,1
8734,when i told the front desk about the problems there wasn't anything she could do about it,1
8735,if you can't stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
8736,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1

8741,entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1

8747,also the jacuzzi is locayed in the adult pool area so we could not stand to be in the condo,1
8748,i want to let everyone know that it is not that far from there,1
8749,as we walked in to the hotel to check in about 1 00am after a long day of driving,1

8751,she gave me a key so i can check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me,1
8752,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
8753,was a very bad experience me and my family will not stay in a days inn ever again,1
8754,after about 15 minutes no one showed up i had to go and ask for towels,1

8759,i arrived late looking for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
8760,horrible experience hotel did nothing to fix this,1
8761,i would have asked for a refund or discount and the woman at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
8762,that guest opened my room in the middle of the night thinking the ceiling was going to cave in so couldn't sleep,1
8763,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting locked out of our room every day,1
8764,when i went into the room the room smelled like mold,1
8765,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
8766,i took a picture to provide to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors,1
8767,the room was dreary and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
8768,i asked for a queen bed and said i had to make a call within,1
8769,i let them know so they send me to another room and if i wanted to book the laquinta inn i would have,1
8770,first of all the front desk had a hard time sleeping because we couldn't get to mobile until late,1
8771,any time we would go to the front desk behind the counter,1
8772,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel experience ever,1
8773,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst hotel i have ever attempted to stay in,1

8775,we stayed multiple nights and had to go back to desk to get help,1
8776,when asked to speak to the manager because of the way i was dressed certainly didn't look like i was there for busines meeting,1
8777,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
8778,i will never stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't stay the second night that we had paid for,1
8779,oh and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
8780,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen,1
8781,i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds at this hotel paying extra for our requested bed type,1
8782,i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
8783,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
8784,when i cancelled my other 2 nights they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,1
8785,banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
8786,i asked if it was ocean and was told it couldn't be that bad,1
8787,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
8788,we had to take it as it was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,1
8789,checked in and within 10 minutes realized there were bed bugs in this hotel and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge,1
8790,she did not offer any kind of explanation just told me it was bed bugs and prescribed medicine for the itching,1
8791,this is by far the worse i've ever seen,1
8792,this property was my preferred place to stay for the night but i hd no choice we were very tired,1
8793,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to look at the room,1
8794,on a more positive note the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
8795,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time in over forty years that we have not left a tip,1
8796,the bathroom was fairly clean this is the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1

8801,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
8802,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
8803,so needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1

8810,the first room i checked into had a bad smell dirty carpets and stained ceiling,1
8811,i was on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
8812,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was decent,1
8813,when we got in the room it was very hot,1
8814,anytime you try to go to the lobby without her,1
8815,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1

8817,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
8818,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and they gave our room to them,1
8819,i left immediately and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
8820,the location of this hotel is totally unprofessional,1

8899,we offered to stay in a place like this can actually operate like this,1
8900,this place should be shut down and gutted,1
8901,the customer service is horrible the staff is very nice we will never stay at this hotel again,1
8902,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and disgusting,1
8903,i would not stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back through my credit card,1
8904,the bathroom ceiling above the shower looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
8905,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night probably good for that but not much else,1
8906,the bathroom sink was stopped up through our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say we did not stay there,1
8907,we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
8908,first night when checked in assigned room was not made again moved to another room unpacked and then realized shower didn't work,1
8909,smelling that dampness in the room for only 2 hours and didn't try to help the situation at all,1
8910,the carpet was peeling up and torn in many places there was a huge stain on the floor in the bathroom,1
8911,the lock on our room did not work and they wanted to give me points,1
8912,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1
8913,heater in room didn't work so we had to leave because there was no a c in the room and the hallway stank badly,1
8914,he refused to refund our money or give us a new room so they gave me rm 314,1
8915,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
8916,i did not even dare to use that nasty coffe maker in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
8917,our room smelled like it had not been wiped down properly,1
8918,the lobby wasn't very clean and the television reception was terrible,1
8919,when we arrived at the hotel around midnight,1
8920,well to start off the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
8921,will never stay at another guest house and not recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the jr,1
8922,the furniture in the room old and outdated but it is not accessible to wheelchair users and they don't make hotel,1
8923,my friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to change the bedding and left for the day,1
8924,and i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even shower,1
8925,they again said they would not refund my money and that it is not as pictured online and were actually much older,1
8926,when i returned to my room the tv did not even work,1
8927,this place can't be a 4 star hotel but when i got there,1
8928,but then my in-laws got the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
8929,we just did not feel safe and the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
8930,between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet there were bed bugs in this hotel and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge,1
8931,we did get a dirty bathroom a toilet i had to ask for breakfast items and coffee hot water were never hotter than lukewarm,1
8932,two words for this place is gross and the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
8933,the best thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
8934,we will not stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back afterwards,1
8935,i did not even dare to use that nasty coffe maker in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
8936,i don't recommend anyone to stay there for less than 30 minutes,1
8937,best i could do was put a chair in front of it to block it just in case,1
8938,decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there and the breakfast was good,1
8939,i did inquire if the room was grimy and reeked,1
8940,i took a shower and the water wouldn't work in the pool,1
8941,finally a man walked out of a door right next to the front desk attendant was not very hospitable and somewhat dismissive,1
8942,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to open the window to try to air out the room,1
8943,checked in and within 10 minutes realized there were bed bugs as he was bitten up from the bed,1
8944,hotel and rooms were not clean at all,1
8945,thankfully he did not have a comforter or pillows on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
8946,com and they said i would have to say this was unacceptable,1
8947,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
8948,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
8949,the only good thing about this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1
8950,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
8951,i was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here again and the board of health,1
8952,so many things were wrong here i don't even want to sit on it,1
8953,the only clean thing about this hotel is that it is not that far from there,1
8954,the manager of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1
8955,the hilton location is great but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
8956,very dirty place was run down room were very dirty and stained while the lock on our room did not even work,1
8957,rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was very helpful but not helpful enough,1
8958,there was a big problem in our room and the hotel told me they had none,1
8959,being tired after a long trip the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked up in the hallway,1
8960,extremely disappointed in wyndham and should get our money back and the manager didn't even care when brought to their attention,1
8961,i requested a rollaway which was also advertised to be available and was told it would be fixed within the hour,1
8962,there was a wad of hair on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
8963,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub,1
8964,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
8965,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
8966,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
8967,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
8968,i guess they tried to make up for the lack of peace and service,1
8969,this has to be the worst hotel i've ever done,1
8970,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
8971,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
8972,i will never stay at a red roof,1
8973,one common bathroom for the whole floor on the 2nd floor and about the size of a closet,1
8974,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
8975,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed at,1
8976,it is the worst experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
8977,and this was on a non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke,1
8978,after getting our room i noticed there were no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories,1
8979,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
8980,two doors in and out of parking lot,1
8981,must have taken a few hours for the room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible,1
8982,we were forced to move to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1
8983,we booked 2 nights at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
8984,we could hear every conversation from the room next to me was showering in my room,1
8985,my mother was not well and could not go any farther so i had to pack up and move to a different hotel without notice,1
8986,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
8987,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and beds were comfortable,1
8988,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything she could do about it,1
8989,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
8990,finally went to the front and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the remainder of our stay,1
8991,i did not stay at this hotel again,1
8992,overall the room was a non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
8993,we arrived on time in the front and they said they did not have a relaxing stay,1
8994,the next morning still no hot water and no heat in room,1
8995,the location of this hotel is totally unprofessional,1
8996,hotel said they could not attempt to refund me anything because i had paid expedia i could not get a receipt because it was prepaid,1
8997,it was so nice to know we had to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
8998,it was 90 when we arrived and we were scared,1
8999,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
9000,one of the keys did not work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
9001,i wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends and family,1
9002,luckily they gave me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
9003,we booked a room for a disabled person,1
9004,then i got a room that was in very poor condition,1
9005,in any event we spent about 45 minutes there and decided we could not stay there and requested our money back,1
9006,it was awful and i will never recommend either you or holiday inn,1
9007,then the room was trashing one of the beds was soaked with who knows what,1
9008,i had to sleep in the car because there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
9009,the staff working behind the front desk were nothing short of astonishing,1
9010,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most dishusting hotel ive ever been to,1
9011,just choose somewhere else to stay he said ok he understood and gave me a credit amounting to less than 1 8 of the bill,1
9012,the room i was placed in they then put me in another room that had no issues with water,1
9013,they had no one available to look at it at 10 the next day,1
9014,the beds were hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
9015,the air conditioner didn't work and i had to search for another one in the middle of the night,1
9016,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
9017,they also did not disclose that there would be a high possibility of it being shut down,1
9018,it was supposed to be a non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
9019,i felt like i was in clean hotel when it came to the room to show us how to operate the tv,1
9020,there were also drug heads running around in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's,1
9021,it took the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
9022,they said they were booked and could not move us to another room,1
9023,i got angry and then he said i didn't have to accomidate me because i booked my room two days in advance,1
9024,this was the first time that i booked a room at the other side so he moved to be closer to them,1
9025,the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting an old run down motel,1
9026,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
9027,sheets had black stains on them mattress was extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
9028,will never stay at another guest house and not recommend it to others due to false advertising of rooms and space,1
9029,the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
9030,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was even cracked,1
9031,but the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
9032,josh at the front desk had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
9033,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
9034,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
9035,the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
9036,i had a business meeting that i had to so i can review,1
9037,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
9038,the rooms are clean but not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
9039,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk could not find my rsvp and my room was switched twice,1
9040,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
9041,there was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
9042,got a non-smoking room it reeked of cigarette smoke,1
9043,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
9044,when we got there they gave us a room at the other side so he moved to be closer to them,1
9045,after finally getting to the room it's filthy and needs a lot of work,1
9046,if you are looking for a really expensive hotel and it is cheap but it is by far the worst experience,1
9047,room 329 the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
9048,very helpful the staff was very rude and inconsiderate she proceeded to tell me,1
9049,this property was my preferred place to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
9050,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far worst hotel room ever based on multiple reasonings,1
9051,and that was not all the curtains in the room were lumpy and must have been 15 years old,1
9052,i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and left a day early from marathon due to this facility,1
9053,we went downstairs and told the guy at the desk said he could not guarantee an early check in,1
9054,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a cockroach in one,1
9055,i do not recommend anyone to stay there for less than a minute on the phone,1
9056,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was by far the worst hotel that i have ever had,1
9057,went back downstairs and front desk gave me a late check out after i agree to pay 75,1
9058,there was a big problem in our room and when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
9059,got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke and it did not have central air conditioning,1
9060,this was by far the worst place i've seen,1
9061,i am shocked that this hotel is being renovated and i was in a newly renovated room,1
9062,room was ok for a 1 night stay this is not a place anyone should stay,1
9063,they were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
9064,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean hair in the shower wall and remained there the whole time of our stay,1
9065,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
9066,i bring a small travel fan and don't have a long attention span,1
9067,they had to give me a receipt when i checked out and asked for a refund,1
9068,i never felt safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty,1
9069,was a very bad experience me and my family decided that it would be a decent place to stay,1
9070,i was worried about bed bugs and he said that it was a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
9071,when we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask for room service still waited over an hour,1
9072,i did not stay as i did not even dare to use that nasty coffe maker in the morning and he didn't even care,1
9073,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
9074,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty both in the room and we left,1
9075,the party in front of us in line,1
9076,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up in the morning feeling like my throat was full of sand,1
9077,basically its old very old building in the heart of times square the marriott marquis is one of my favorite hotels,1
9078,but this time i can see that the front desk clerk was very abrupt with me and said to deal with it,1
9079,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
9080,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
9081,when asked to speak to a manager she said he was not available,1
9082,when i went to register i went with my girlfriend and they charge me extra money just for stay 15 more minutes,1
9083,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no record of my card ever being swiped,1
9084,we tried to close the curtains but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
9085,this property is a horrible location in the middle of the night there was a guest screaming in the hall from 2-3am,1
9086,then we get to the room and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
9087,she then asked if i wanted to stay in a place like this can actually operate like this,1
9088,asked for a non smoking room floor and the entire hotel smelled very bad,1
9089,they offered me a rubber door stop sadly i have been traveling around the country for almost two months now,1
9090,we needed an inexpensive hotel stay and that's what you are getting and if you don't stay,1
9091,also upon check-in the gentleman at the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
9092,thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of there constantly from the highway that are not guests,1
9093,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it waddle security or what but it made us all uncomfortable,1
9094,was very dirty the only good thing about our stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
9095,i knew i would never stay there again,1
9096,their idea of a continental breakfast was a danish and an apple,1
9097,after complaining to the manager she did apologize and gave me a print out showing we didn't stay,1
9098,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it the environment or the community,1
9099,front desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
9100,we received our requested room number it was clean and there was a large upholstered chair up on one of the unmade beds,1
9101,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
9102,the hotel double charged me bed was awful it was dirty there was a hole in the wall place,1
9103,gross not worth the money for a room like this,1
9104,the plumbing was so bad that there was no coffee maker,1
9105,we stayed multiple nights and had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
9106,will not ever be coming back to this place and it scared them straight,1
9107,we stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
9108,once we checked in the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
9109,when asked to speak to the owner about the check-in is a zoo,1
9110,this was the worst place i have ever been in,1
9111,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
9112,the neighborhood was nice and it was close to monterey and that's about it,1
9113,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no available rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
9114,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
9115,we called the front desk from my cell phone to let them know about this but no response,1
9116,the shower in the master bath did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
9117,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
9118,i knew this was going to happen now,1
9119,to be honest i wouldn't stay at the hotel because they had pallets of material on the property,1
9120,it was saturday and they told me there was nothing they could do because they don't know it's gone,1
9121,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
9122,we came here and ask that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
9123,despite being a non smoking hotel my room reeked of cigarette smoke and it did not have central air conditioning,1
9124,the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting locked out of our room on ground floor,1
9125,she did not tell me till the next morning i think next time i,1
9126,we had 2 rooms and my family and i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
9127,swimming pool was very cold so i went back to the lady at the front desk wasn't kind,1
9128,when we arrived there was no one else in the lobby,1
9129,the paint in the room was old but clean and the bed was extremely uncomfortable,1
9130,i walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
9131,we arrived late into the night and didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me,1
9132,the resort itself was very nice and helpful but the rooms and the coffee shop doesn't open until after 7 00am,1
9133,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've ever visited,1
9134,even though the hotel manager told us that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on bed smelled like dog,1
9135,the manager doesn't seem to care or was concerned,1
9136,after a twelve hour drive from georgia my husband i were very tired and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
9137,reported this the next morning to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to know where to put us,1
9138,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the front office but they wouldn't adjust the price,1
9139,best i got was a late check our since we were in the area for twelve years but have never made it to this place,1
9140,motwani was hard to find i didn't get apologies for the disaster,1
9141,stay far far away from this place would not recommend it to others due to false advertising of rooms and space,1
9142,com and have never had a problem with the hotels,1
9143,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
9144,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but no changes were made,1
9145,the exterior of the hotel is old and dirty,1
9146,bathroom in the room wasn't non refundable i would have left immediately,1

9149,there was a big problem in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some,1
9150,the furniture in the room wasn't cleaned,1
9151,the furniture in the room was very dirty,1
9152,next time i will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay,1
9153,we checked out after the first night because of the conditions of the rooms or clean the mold build up,1
9154,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1

9158,when we went to the hotel to check in about 1 00am after a long day of travel 12 hours of driving,1
9159,the room smell like cigarettes this place is a hotel factory,1
9160,he felt that i was ripped off for 100,1
9161,it's just not worth the money that i spent,1
9162,i had a business meeting that i had to go and ask for towels,1
9163,there was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the door where you could see outside through our door and our ac unit,1
9164,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
9165,the furniture in the room wasn't too clean so only after a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
9166,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
9167,again things happen but every time we would go to the front desk as i was in a newly renovated room,1
9168,needless to say we checked out a day before i did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids,1
9169,we would never recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
9170,the manager of the hotel was a huge disappointment,1
9171,mold all over the bathroom bugs everywhere the pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep,1
9172,casino was fine but i will never go there again,1
9173,it was late i need a place to crash late at night,1
9174,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
9175,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
9176,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1

9197,toilet was overflowing when we got there and the breakfast was decent,1
9198,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
9199,the other comforter had seamen stains all over it and down in to the cushion,1
9200,the mgr put me in another room that had double beds,1
9201,i would not recommend this motel to anyone,1
9202,the pool looked cloudy so my children didn't have the package and the front desk guy is rude,1
9203,this place sucks i would never stay here again and can not recommend it,1
9204,this has to be the worst hotel experience we have had,1
9205,this hotel motel is not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
9206,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk didn't ask for i d for packages,1
9207,the rooms smelled musty and the smell of urine was extremely strong,1
9208,l don't porpoise this hotel to anyone nor would i stay here again,1
9209,told him about the beds being very hard and all he had to say was sorry but since you booked through a 3rd party hotel,1
9210,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
9211,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor where we were staying,1
9212,went back to get a different room and was told no,1
9213,i got into the room it was supposed to be a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
9214,we did not stay there because i was on a budget otherwise i definitely would not have stayed here,1
9215,questioned him about how many people were in the same boat as we were,1
9216,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
9217,but i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and left a day early from marathon due to this facility,1
9218,the staff was rude and the rooms were not very clean,1
9219,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
9220,my wife says monday morning she is going to call and have everything taken care including that night,1
9221,also the door looked like it had not been cleaned either,1
9222,i was like that was perfect as i would be checking out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
9223,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
9224,this place is absolutely the worst hospitality experience that i have ever stayed in,1
9225,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
9226,no offer to upgrade i had to ask for new towels and never got them,1
9227,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
9228,the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the room was the same and as clean in which the lady responded yes,1
9229,every area of the hotel i decided to look under the sheets on the bed looked like it was kicked in,1
9230,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
9231,when i cancelled my other 2 nights they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
9232,when water in the bathroom was not clean hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room,1
9233,really can't recommend this hotel to anyone,1
9234,first floor smelled of smoke even though we had air conditioner appeared that was not working correctly,1
9235,i arrived at the hotel i was told the carpet in the room was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
9236,the front desk area stay at the ramada down the street for the same price i wasn't offered a refund of any sort,1
9237,obviously the bathroom and the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
9238,was also charged for room service i didn't even bother cleaning the room for us,1
9239,the hotel location is probably the only good thing about it is the two cats who live there,1
9240,room was very small and the air conditioning didn't work and telephone by the bed didn't work,1
9241,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
9242,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
9243,that was horrible experience i wish i could get my money back today,1
9244,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
9245,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
9246,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst hotel you can ever find,1
9247,the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk said there was nothing she could do,1
9248,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and bed had a big dip in it,1
9249,the place looks like it is falling apart,1
9250,it was not even worth the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
9251,she did not tell me till the next morning i checked out and continued to charge my credit card,1
9252,upon arrival they did not have any amenities as promised,1
9253,parked across the street at a red roof,1
9254,would never ever stay here again and i do not recommend staying here,1
9255,we decided to cut our stay short and when i went to check out she said sunday morning at 11 a,1
9256,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair,1
9257,the outlet for the hair dryer was out of order iron did not work,1
9258,it didn't appear any construction was going on in room above us,1
9259,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room motel style,1
9260,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
9261,i love super 8 as ever and trust this motel until we stay in this area often and we will never go back,1
9262,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst experience of my life,1
9263,we checked out and went to another hotel but i couldn't get towels for my room,1
9264,my step daughter came up for the day and my room is the last room for her,1
9265,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem very active or present,1
9266,finally called the boardroom and they said yes however my room was not ready,1
9267,miserable experience and we will never stay at this hotel again,1
9268,we had a smoking room and we are very able the window did not have a fridge very disappointed,1
9269,what i do have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
9270,when i tried to check in at 5 30pm,1
9271,needless to say i will not recommend this motel to anyone,1
9272,the parking lot was different being in front of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
9273,we went back to the desk and told here we couldn't stay there the manager i think was,1
9274,it was dirty tv remote didn't work the air conditioner didn't work and the refrigerator didn't work,1
9275,when we asked to talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
9276,com told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me for a room i already paid for,1
9277,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
9278,as we walked up the stairs to our room we were moved out of the room to go kill time,1
9279,the condition of one the beds was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
9280,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the driver will take us,1
9281,the one thing we asked for and didn't get seated until 10 35pm,1
9282,not a very good location and the service staff was very friendly but the place was not my favorite,1
9283,my sister and i stayed here for a funeral with my sisters,1
9284,when we first checked in the room was not held the reservation was not honored,1
9285,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting hotel i've ever done,1
9286,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
9287,we had the heat full blast and we froze in the middle of august you need the ac,1
9288,when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the parking area laundry in the yard drying,1
9289,if you frequent hostels and don't have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
9290,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in,1
9291,the beds were hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
9292,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to a different hotel without notice,1
9293,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
9294,i would never stay there again i see why it was not full,1
9295,it was very discussing they delayed our check in time because they said they were completely booked and could not move us,1
9296,i booked one room for one night and it was just disgusting,1
9297,we stayed there this time last year with an adequate room with a view this past weekend and it was a great overall trip,1
9298,had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom was not clean and asked that it get special attention that day to get cleaned,1
9299,many other issues but i will never return to this dirty nasty place no mater how cheap it is,1
9300,first off let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a 2 bed room either double beds or queens,1
9301,overall great for a short stop and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
9302,the bathroom had a hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room was not non-smoking,1
9303,because she didn't have any smoking rooms left but when i got to the room it's filthy and needs a lot of work,1
9304,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and beds were comfortable,1
9305,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
9306,we came upstairs to look at the room it smelled very stale and old,1
9307,later to make sure it was okay and was a room for the night,1
9308,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
9309,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
9310,com reservation said it was a great view of fremont st,1
9311,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
9312,we complained and the man at the front desk was helpful and brought us a rollaway,1
9313,my 11 year old did not want to work and the bed was a thin piece of cardboard,1
9314,after numerous attempts i was finally able to get someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
9315,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and didn't care what they had to say about it,1
9316,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
9317,i have actually stayed here before and the room was actually nice,1
9318,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
9319,i was told i had to speak with the manager who did nothing,1
9320,had an attitude like she didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me,1
9321,called the front desk from my cell phone to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
9322,we ended up with a smoking room when i requested a non smoking room,1
9323,i called this hotel directly and they said they will call me back to solve the problem,1
9324,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
9325,they said that was the only alternative unless i wanted to park in the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
9326,we had a very hard time actually staying there because it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
9327,i complain to the desk i was told to go to a local service station to get some,1
9328,we thought that the room was not smoke free,1
9329,i told the front desk lady was rude,1
9330,i am very disappointed at the four seasons,1
9331,when we entered the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
9332,i informed him about what happened and he said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call,1
9333,tv kept turning off called the front desk and evicted me from the hotel for prostitution,1
9334,my 11 year old did not want to work and the bed was very comfortable,1
9335,the teenager at the front desk was creepy,1
9336,the conditions off my room was terrible a broken bed the tv didn't work at all for my entire stay,1
9337,we went and asked to be let in,1
9338,there were bugs all over the bathroom floor sink and tub,1
9339,we walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
9340,we checked in and went to the pool,1
9341,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
9342,we paid 300 for two nights my boyfriend and i were in town for a function and on a tight schedule,1
9343,room was ok for a 1 night stay this is not a 3,1
9344,trash behind night stand and bathroom door and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
9345,as we walked in to the hotel to check in about 1 00am after a long day of traveling and meetings,1
9346,the hotel itself was very nice but we will never ever return to this property,1
9347,i accidently booked 2 rooms in this hotel over the weekend of february 19th 2016,1
9348,i did not stay at this hotel again,1
9349,we had to keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
9350,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
9351,we stayed there friday through sunday for a wrestling tournament and there is a good reason why,1
9352,we did not stay there because i was on a budget,1
9353,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very rude and they lack customer service skills,1
9354,so we immediately went back to the lady at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
9355,i do not recommend anyone to stay there,1
9356,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
9357,room 329 the first room they put me in the strike plate was missing on the toilet paper holder had no rod,1
9358,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1
9359,all the reason we will not stay at another red roof inn,1
9360,cheap rates but not worth it because we had to pay for room again,1
9361,asked for a different room and was told it couldn't be that bad,1
9362,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
9363,there were cigarette burns on the bed and dirt,1
9364,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't checked anyone could have entered my room,1
9365,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the mattress,1
9366,asked for a non smoking room as i did not feel safe with just the locks on the door,1
9367,the shower head was coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
9368,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
9369,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
9370,that problem was cordially taken care of at the front desk didn't have a single craft beer,1
9371,check in was awkward as the front desk person was not able to find my hhonors membership and claimed,1
9372,the check in was quick and i had asked for a ground floor because my son is handicapped,1
9373,i paid 139 per night for this room and i would have rather stayed at a motel 6,1
9374,there were strands of hair all over the walls from where people had been smoking in a non-smoking room on the website,1
9375,on a more positive note the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
9376,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
9377,hotel appeared rundown and old fixtures were outdated and did not work properly management told me they just replaced 2 weeks earlier,1
9378,we called the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
9379,went back to get a different room and was told it couldn't be that bad,1
9380,view more me out of sleep and when i looked at the pictures from the internet versus real life,1
9381,i took a shower and went to bed thinking the room would heat up,1
9382,there was an iron left on the floor in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
9383,bagging on my door at 10 45 and yelling at me that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
9384,there was an instant odor as soon as you opened the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
9385,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
9386,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had one in the previous room,1
9387,it was not even worth the price we paid the hotel itself was disappointing,1
9388,hotel front staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
9389,when i gave the ticket to the taxi driver he told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available,1
9390,on top of that had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
9391,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
9392,my suite door look like it hadn't been cleaned properly,1
9393,i left immediately and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
9394,not sure if the smoke was coming from another room but it was late and no sophisticated menu was available,1
9395,so by this time it was 1 am and we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would enjoy staying in,1
9396,i went back down to ask for a room change and got one but that room had the same issue with someone else,1
9397,we asked where to check in and they couldn't find the reservation on their end,1
9398,she told us she would move us to a new room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
9399,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room also,1
9400,i slept in my vehicle in a rest stop would be 5 star compared to this place,1
9401,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair on them,1
9402,i am almost certain this happened in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
9403,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
9404,they said they were completely booked and could not do anything for us,1
9405,the telephone in our room did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
9406,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the bathroom said please lets just take this,1
9407,the rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke,1
9408,did not stay after i saw the room and the hallway stank badly,1
9409,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
9410,the most uncomfortable room and bed i have yet to get an email back,1
9411,additionally they charge us duoble of its regular price due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming,1
9412,i requested another room and the hotel there were problems,1
9413,two doors in and out of parking lot,1
9414,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and beds were comfortable,1
9415,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
9416,the room had pretty hair all over it as if somebody just took a shower and went to bed,1
9417,we booked at this hotel specifically because we were traveling with and we could not bring ourselves to stay there,1
9418,the walls door was paper thin and the bed was a thin piece of cardboard,1
9419,we found the hidden microwave and mini fridge on the day we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
9420,we checked in got into our room almost an hour after arriving and it was dirty not ready so they moved me to another room,1
9421,reported this the next morning to the front desk and they said they would get someone to look at it,1
9422,never going back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
9423,i will never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back afterwards,1
9424,the second time i got screwed over i check into the hotel and were immediately turned off,1
9425,finally called the boardroom and they said yes however my room was not,1
9426,they answered our questions curtly and seemed to want us out of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
9427,worse stay i've ever had to stay in a 2 bed room either double beds or queens,1
9428,room had strong musty old cigarette stink that did not fade fridge did not work tv got one station with no volume,1
9429,between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet there were bed bugs as he was bitten up from the bed,1
9430,to my utter disgust the room was dirty and in disrepair not a value for the money,1
9431,my room despite being told it was a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on them,1
9432,i would never recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort,1
9433,upon entrance to our room we were moved out of the room to share with others,1
9434,no towels broken locks smells like smoke in a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
9435,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the worst experience i have had with a hotel,1
9436,we opened the door to our room was broke and didn't even come to take care of the problem,1
9437,i do not recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car next time before booking this dump,1
9438,did not get the room i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
9439,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting into a argument with them and they would not refund us anything,1
9440,it served its purpose as a place to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
9441,almost seemed liked the rule was you couldn't stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
9442,i took a shower and the whole room had a very musty smell because it was partly below the ground,1
9443,he told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me for a room i already paid for,1
9444,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
9445,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room all through the night,1
9446,we had to close the door didn't work either,1
9447,the outlet for the hair dryer was out of order iron did not work,1
9448,i called the office about the light and they said i would have to say this was the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
9449,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
9450,she said to call the manager in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
9451,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
9452,when i called the front desk from my cell phone to let them know about this but no response,1
9453,glad i didn't have a place to stay for the money in appleton,1
9454,i don't believe we should have to pay a deposit so i had a small dog they didn't have a working tv,1
9455,attempted to check in and they gave our room to them,1
9456,to make matters worst there were roaches in the room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
9457,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the phone number for the manager and assured us we would get a refund,1
9458,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so security was a joke,1
9459,the room was very dirty with stains everywhere i didn't even want to use the tub or shower at all,1
9460,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk,1
9461,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
9462,however it is not worth the high price they charge,1
9463,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
9464,i left after being in there for less than a minute on the phone,1
9465,the non smoking room smell like cigarettes this place is a dump,1
9466,after swimming we went back to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
9467,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was very hot,1
9468,the pool area was supposed to close at 9 00 pm after waking up at 3 30 am and it woke us up,1
9469,this was the worst motel i have stayed in for years,1
9470,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
9471,the carpets are dirty our couch had a hole in it there was no toilet paper or complimentary soaps,1
9472,don't stay on the first floor as i requested,1
9473,first thing i saw when i walked into the room it was musty and humid,1
9474,worst comfort inn that i have stayed in the was the worst,1
9475,None,1
9476,this room was absolutely disgusting dirty towels and sheets with stains,1
9477,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1
9478,checked out a day before i did not feel safe and had to leave,1
9479,definitely not worth the money thank god only for one night and it was just horrible nightmare,1
9480,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel i have ever seen,1
9481,i stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
9482,room service is bad the maid knocked on my door at 10 45 and yelling at me that it was under constriction,1
9483,while both employees were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
9484,and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk and picked up phone filthy,1
9485,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and didn't get was a wheelchair accessible bathroom,1
9486,this hotel ruined our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say we did not stay at this hotel again,1
9487,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and dirt around the edges of the bathroom,1
9488,this was the worst hotel experience i've ever had to stay in a hotel,1
9489,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
9490,i would not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
9491,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the microwave,1
9492,only perk was the matrix shampoo and the bed was a thin piece of cardboard,1
9493,i let them know so they send me to another room it was about the same,1
9494,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
9495,no hot water was made available i had to check out alone and deal with this,1
9496,ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
9497,we forgot an item but when we called to make a reservation and the front desk said they were to busy to help us,1
9498,arrived late there were many homeless walking around in the parking lot broke down car in lot as well,1
9499,after about 2 hours hotel staff told us they had already sold the room and probably did,1
9500,com but when we got to the room it was musty and humid,1
9501,the place was filthy and there were holes in the frame where it looks like it hadn't been scrubbed in weeks,1
9502,arrived at 10 30p after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
9503,when we arrived florida we were supposed to have a nonsmoking room,1
9504,the location is out in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
9505,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute booking that we needed to extend a family trip,1
9506,i had a very bad experience me and my family decided that it would be a decent place to stay,1
9507,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was almost dry,1
9508,the clerk kept swiping my card i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
9509,when we checked out we didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes on,1
9510,when we called front desk to mention this,1
9511,i have stayed with laquinta multiple times before and have never had a problem this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,1
9512,shower door was broken and the floors were so dirty and gross i never took my shoes off,1
9513,we went back to the room and closed it again,1
9514,there was old body fluids on the floor at the end of our vacation we wanted to pay with cash rather than cards,1
9515,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
9516,the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were bothering them to service us,1
9517,not only was the pieces of furniture in the room was not prepared well for one's visit,1
9518,the tv didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
9519,i paid for two nights but did not stay after checking in and finding out about the hold the hotel did nothing to fix this,1
9520,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for a long weekend from march 6 thru 8,1
9521,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
9522,again i was in a nonsmoking room and the room was actually nice,1
9523,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is absolutely unconcerned didn't,1
9524,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
9525,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the bathroom,1
9526,i kept waiting for the ceiling tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go get them dresser had diapers in drawer,1
9527,when i got in the room it was disgusting,1
9528,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting locked out of our room every day,1
9529,the carpet was atrocious and when i went to check out she said sunday morning at 11 a,1
9530,toliet paper when i got there the rooms were in terrible shape by far the worst hotel you can ever find,1
9531,if you can't stay in that room for the night,1
9532,not only was it dirty but the smell was not coming from the bathroom,1
9533,of course its not their fault call expedia,1
9534,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was moldy musty or what,1
9535,and i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the absolute worst checkin experience that we have ever had,1
9536,after we complained we were put in a room with no amenities,1
9537,and i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and usually they are older but not to bad,1
9538,we just did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
9539,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
9540,i left immediately and asked for a receipt the same guy who checked us in suggested moving us to a different room,1
9541,we went and asked to be switched to another room and if i wanted to go elsewhere,1
9542,the rooms didn't look anything like what was advertised on the check in counter,1
9543,reserved a non smoking room as i did not feel safe,1
9544,not best neighborhood down filmore but did not feel safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty,1
9545,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
9546,there was a air purifier in the room but it was late and we were very tired,1
9547,we move forward and got our room keys as we walk up to the room smelled like urine and there were bugs a d mold,1
9548,location this hotel is right in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
9549,i was scared couldn't tell who they were considering the hotel was in need of serious remodeling and maintenance,1
9550,i spent three nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
9551,she was not welcoming nor helpful when we asked for help and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
9552,other room clock broken tub took 30 minutes to even get checked in,1
9553,i went back to the desk and told here we couldn't stay after the first night,1
9554,i almost ended in the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
9555,i did not stay as i did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids,1
9556,bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be either torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
9557,we had to wait to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
9558,way over priced for the condition of the hotel and the room wasn't cleaned because she thought we already checked out,1
9559,i booked this hotel because i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
9560,arrived at 10 30p after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
9561,stay away from this hotel if you have another choice,1
9562,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
9563,one of the worst holiday inns that i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
9564,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
9565,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
9566,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
9567,we will never stay here again i would rather pay 3 times more for a,1
9568,there were hairs in the shower when we got there it was 20 degrees at night and window wouldn't close,1
9569,this was my first time staying at this hotel and found a dirty pair of men's underwear in the room,1
9570,we called the front desk from my cell phone to let them know about this but no response,1
9571,they overbooked the hotel and sent us to another property and paid for the room through expedia i knew i had to stay,1
9572,we walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
9573,we checked in got into our room and found used underwear hanging from the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
9574,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i had to put a 5,1
9575,someone should have informed me that i was being giving and ada room and didn't have anything it said it should,1
9576,internet was very slow and most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
9577,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
9578,the first response i got was i can't believe these can get away with this,1
9579,we will never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back,1
9580,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
9581,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of our vacation we wanted to pay with cash rather than cards,1
9582,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
9583,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1
9584,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a nursing home,1
9585,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
9586,when we first arrived i thought the smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
9587,at bedtime discovered that one of the beds sank in the middle,1
9588,they may be doing some remodeling but what we saw on our stay was not a good hospitality and rude staff,1
9589,my step daughter came up for the day and my room is the last room for her,1
9590,i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but i would not recommend to friends,1
9591,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
9592,cable didn't work and we had to wait for somewhere to sit,1
9593,staff was nice but the room was not cleaned from my previous night,1
9594,i booked 2 nights at this hotel because it was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,1
9595,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room motel style,1
9596,finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and covers were dirty and the entire building had a dirty smell,1
9597,couldn't check in as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
9598,then when i went to the front desk to complain,1
9599,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk was extremely friendly that's where the good part of the experience,1
9600,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the shower i noticed several pieces of hair all over the sheets and pillows,1
9601,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the pictures on the website were nothing like the rooms,1
9602,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no,1
9603,no offer to upgrade i had to ask for a wash cloth,1
9604,went i to our room and there was no one at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
9605,the hotel was filthy and i would never go back again,1
9606,horrible experience hotel did nothing to fix this,1
9607,would have been nice to know that the hotel was under construction from 9am-5pm monday-friday,1
9608,when we returned the next night we opened the door to the steps and side door bangs loudly,1
9609,not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
9610,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
9611,the bathroom door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't a conftable night,1
9612,it was convenient because it was next to the unit was literally shacking,1
9613,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor and had ants on the night table and the desk,1
9614,there were ants in my room and have tried to contact a manger multiple times and have yet to get any response,1
9615,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
9616,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
9617,however this was the worst hotel i've ever stayed at the staff was awful hateful and rude,1
9618,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to look at the room,1
9619,didn't even say hello as we walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really expensive,1
9620,and this was on a non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
9621,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
9622,the room smelled horrible of stale cigarette smoke including the rooms,1
9623,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name,1
9624,our room was on the 2nd floor and about the size of a lap top in a corner,1
9625,once we were finally checked in we were charged an extra 40 for a non smoking room on a non smoking floor,1
9626,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
9627,if you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay in advance and there is no elevator,1
9628,so sad to have to pay for it i still haven't received the call,1
9629,i asked about changing rooms and was told they would not do anything about the issue,1
9630,when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there were black flying bugs in the bathroom,1
9631,the inside of the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was anything but,1
9632,staff was unable to check us in so he called someone else and the man who worked at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
9633,the hotel needs major work the room was nasty we could not take a bath had to use shower 4,1
9634,the place was filthy and i would never stay here again,1
9635,hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1
9636,so i would stay some where else at the last minute during week of the masters,1
9637,i booked online and i didn't stay the third night,1
9638,they have no time to come the room to look at the room it smelled very stale and old,1
9639,this room was much nicer but we found out that the swimming pool was on the small size but clean,1
9640,the room smelled rotten the lock on the door was broken the bathroom door didn't shut and there was electrical outlets exposed,1
9641,manager came in at 6 am when i asked for a new room so they gave me rm 314,1
9642,the worst check out tuesday went to a different hotel that is how dirty this hotel was,1
9643,so we had to wait to check in and they gave our room away,1
9644,i informed the staff upon check out and all they did was change the towels and make the beds,1
9645,after we finally got the keys they tried to put us in a room above the check in area,1
9646,hallways and rooms were extremely hot took 3 to 4 hours to get the room only to find out in the morning,1
9647,told the male manager and he said he would look for the dial,1
9648,when we called front desk to mention this,1
9649,my family and i have stayed at this chain before,1
9650,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1
9651,it was convenient because it was next to the unit was literally shacking,1
9652,when we left in the morning many of them were still hanging out in the food area while they should have been cleaning our room,1
9653,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
9654,everything would have been find if we had a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed,1
9655,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up having to take one room,1
9656,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
9657,we selected the hotel because of stuffy room,1
9658,front desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
9659,i would wake up in the middle by bailing wire,1
9660,there was no fridge in this room even though we had just walked from there and took pictures,1
9661,everything smelled like cigarette smoke in a non smoking room and received a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
9662,i called back one more time and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
9663,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
9664,it was an okay room for the money but i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
9665,obviously the bathroom and the smell was covered up by the comforter,1
9666,the man at front desk was very rude and unaccomidating,1
9667,if we left during the night we could not get another room until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
9668,the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
9669,then property use to be own by country inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
9670,i ask for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk said they were to busy to help us,1
9671,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
9672,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
9673,the hotel was clean and comfortable but for the price we could have stayed down the street at a red roof in again,1
9674,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
9675,after such a wonderful day me and my family didn't even stay there,1
9676,if we had more time to find another hotel and i am still waiting to get my money back,1
9677,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a nursing home,1
9678,there is low income housing and the room is extremely musky and dusty,1
9679,they had no one available to look at it at 10 the next day,1
9680,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting into a argument with them and they would not work with them either,1
9681,one of the keys did not work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
9682,we then went to dinner and when we got in the room the windows were open and the smell was terrible,1
9683,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
9684,she then asked if i wanted to stay in that room for the night,1
9685,we left and will never stay their agin,1
9686,that was the worst hotel stay i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
9687,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1
9688,the hotel smells bad and the staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
9689,i felt like i was in clean hotel when it came to the room to show us bet was too busy checking in other guests,1
9690,elevator was broken and i had to search for another one in the middle of time square but the rooms are not anything special,1
9691,who runs a business like this when they found a room we were given had a king and a sofa bed,1
9692,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
9693,we didn't feel safe at all during my stay,1
9694,reported it to the front desk and was never offered another room they,1
9695,looked like it had not been vacuumed in a week and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways,1
9696,i just don't have words because 2 weeks later and i am still waiting to receive credit back on my credit card,1
9697,bad place overall even if you don't mind screaming neighbors plentiful marijuana smoke and broken elevators,1
9698,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
9699,the room was out of date the bed not comfortable the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
9700,if you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay in advance and there is no sound proof glass 3,1
9701,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls didn't match,1
9702,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
9703,so i asked for my money back and he told me fine just leave,1
9704,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and the room was seedy,1
9705,i never felt safe in this hotel and i had to go and ask for towels,1
9706,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
9707,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
9708,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
9709,do your self a favor and don't stay here even if it's free,1
9710,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
9711,this is by far the worse i've ever seen,1
9712,this hotel ruined our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say we would never choose to stay here again,1
9713,but the staff at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
9714,i arrived in the late evening after a long drive and had to wait till 4 pm,1
9715,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
9716,don't have the word i don't like to sign s with knowing what it is,1
9717,the shower was in need of repair and it was very nice,1
9718,then they switched us to another room on the first floor and the lobby smelled really musty,1
9719,hair on the floor and in the tub on tub walls,1
9720,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
9721,this is our first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
9722,when we asked how that could happen we were at the front desk was totally incompetent,1
9723,so heres some advice look for another hotel and stay far away from this place rooms suck internet sucks screams at all hours,1
9724,the man at front desk was very unprofessional and disrespectful,1
9725,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
9726,there was no air on in the so the we had to leave or they were calling the cops,1
9727,the shower in the next room all night,1
9728,it was late i need a place to crash late at night,1
9729,i went to check out early because i couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
9730,the place was filthy and there were holes in the walls missing fiextures etc,1
9731,the one good thing i can say about this joint is that at least i didn't have any of these issues with the room,1
9732,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is a bad form of advertisement,1
9733,could not get cold water we had to let the water run for a while and not to use hot water,1
9734,we waited 30 minutes for another room to be cleaned to find out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear,1
9735,pool was closed for repairs which was one of the worst places i have ever stayed in,1
9736,i should get a refund it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
9737,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
9738,the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the a c was not on in the room,1
9739,the hair dryer was out of order iron did not work,1
9740,my 1-year-old 3-year-old husband and myself walked around the room barefoot for an hour and her,1
9741,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
9742,when i got there was told that i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
9743,room was not what i booked or paid for and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
9744,the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
9745,stayed the week before and didn't have anything it said it should,1
9746,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
9747,it was by far the worst hotel that i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
9748,it was faustino who was at the front desk after 12 minutes they finally came up,1
9749,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
9750,i would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
9751,on our way through the casino floor security tool me to the front desk and told them what was going on,1
9752,reeked of mildew parts of the room were very dirty and ripped,1
9753,when we went into the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
9754,this hotel still needs a lot of repairs also i will never stay there again,1
9755,when we got back again there was water all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
9756,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
9757,when we got in the room and acknowledge the problem,1
9758,we tried to leave and we were told that the room would smell,1
9759,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
9760,as we entered into he entrance in the back of the door looked like it had not been wiped down properly,1
9761,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the word i don't like this part what do you want,1
9762,looks nothing like the pictures on the internet are very deceiving,1
9763,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the room was never clean,1
9764,their lounge barleycorn's didn't have a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
9765,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat there was holes in the furniture,1
9766,it was horrible right away when we walked in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
9767,i asked the lady at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
9768,then when we got to our room we were moved out of the room to share with others,1
9769,hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot and yell at our group,1
9770,thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
9771,we will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and when i checked in they said i had no room,1
9772,our friends had a room that smelled like a slaughter yard,1
9773,it was in the room it was a 30 room this is a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
9774,when i returned to my room the tv did not work the lamp was broken,1
9775,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
9776,i wouldn't stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
9777,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
9778,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
9779,and when i mentioned the bed bugs the front desk attendant he was very willing to help but needed the manager,1
9780,the air conditioner didn't work and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub and rinse this way,1
9781,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
