314,when we returned to our room after the first night i cancelled everything and moved elsewhere,1

316,everywhere i looked in our room and the hotel told me they had none,1
317,when we arrived there was no one at the counter,1
318,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
319,the staff working behind the front desk were very nice and tried to help as much as possible,1
320,i was given the faulty room specifically because i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
321,they did not switch me rooms as they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
322,1 when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
323,we stayed there friday through sunday for a wrestling tournament and there is a good reason why,1
324,pretty much the worst place i've ever stayed at the staff was awful hateful and rude,1
325,i told him that i will dispute the charges on my credit card even though room was paid for,1
326,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1

332,granted it is 4:30am in the morning but coffee was spot on,1
333,took a shower and the whole room had a very musty smell because it was partly below the ground,1
334,when we arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long drive we would have attempted to locate another hotel to stay in,1
335,i could see through the sheets on the bed looked like they had grease stains on them and when we asked them,1
336,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a pet toilet,1
337,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
338,its very unfortunate that a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
339,when we got in the room it was a 30 room this is a very nice place,1
340,there were also drug heads running around in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
341,the bath room and shower was filthy with dirt bathroom tub full of rust dirt and it was just disgusting,1
342,walls are paper thin and you can hear everything on the other room,1
343,i asked 2 times towels and heck the ac is not working they never came to fix it they just removed it,1

350,i knew that i would be charged 3,1
351,we purchased a nice room with a balcony to be able to relax prior to the race,1
352,the airport shuttle which was one of the reasons i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
353,i called the front desk to speak to an agent and she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the computer,1
354,this was by far one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1
355,the front desk did not seem to care about anything,1
356,i then got to my room i had to call hotels to dispute the charges,1
357,we were told we would not get a refund because it's a third party billing and i'm not talking about any luxury,1

374,we would have asked for a different room they said they were booked and could not move us,1
375,when we asked for more they said they did not have reservation or any rooms available,1
376,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
377,although the location is great close to the beach but not worth the cost of what we paid for,1

410,got a headache every time i went to the front desk and the phone did not work,1
411,the management told me that there was no one at the desk,1
412,it is nasty to even stay in the room the windows were open and the smell was covered up by air freshener,1

418,this is one of the worst hotel i've stayed at,1
419,it was dirty with spots and stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
420,i stay in a lot of hotels motels around where this place is so dirty,1
421,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
422,the hotel was fine but not worth the cost of what we paid no reason all this went on and they didnt care,1
423,this room was much nicer but we found out that the swimming pool was not very clean,1
424,could not get cold water we had to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
425,we checked into our room looked at the condition it was in and i left and found a different hotel,1
426,i left after being in there for less than a minute on the phone,1
427,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
428,my kids refused to stay at the super 8 then proceeded to tell me,1
429,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
430,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but were told no other rooms were available,1
431,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
432,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
433,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not seem to care,1
434,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
435,there were splatter stains all over the bed and no towels or soap,1
436,in my room the furniture was old outdated and it smelled,1
437,i arrived at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1
438,dirty dishes and the hall entering the room was so small that you had enough room to turn around with the door closed,1
439,that asked us for our car info at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the parking lot,1
440,almost had to stand on the drain hole in the bathtub to take a shower and there was no one to come clean it,1
441,i was disappointed in our room and when i turned the sheets back it was clear that they were not clean,1
442,the next day we found out that the swimming pool was on the small size but clean,1
443,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
444,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the bath towels had black dirty stains,1
445,are you kidding we were then put in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are,1
446,when i called the front desk the next morning was the one positive of this stay,1
447,if you cant feel safe in the hotel room as well as in the shower,1
448,room smelled like sewer and called front desk and they gave me a new set,1
449,the rude lady would not give me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
450,we thought we were getting a suite but we ended up getting into a argument with them and they would not work with them either,1
451,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed in,1
452,when i checked in they didn't have the energy to continue the day's journey,1
453,i asked her for expedia number so that i could at least know what to expect,1
454,there were no towels there were stains on the comforter the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it,1
455,they had no one available to look at it at 10 the next day,1
456,if i wasn't so tired would leave,1
457,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and the room was actually nice,1
458,when we walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
459,i wouldn't be dissappointed if the room was the very strong oder,1
460,the pillows were hard and the size of a lap top in a corner,1
461,bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
462,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst i stayed ever,1
463,the chair in the room still had crumbs on it like it wasn't vacuumed,1
464,when we arrived florida we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
465,i asked the front desk to complain the night manager had soured my attitude toward the place,1
466,but this time i can see that the front desk clerk samantha refused to honor it and was rather rude,1
467,we had a smoking room and we are very able the window did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
468,listed breakfast but have no idea where it would have been more comfortable in a tent,1
469,many of the lights didn't work right,1
470,i informed the staff upon check out and all they did was change the towels and make the beds,1
471,the elevator was disgusting someone urinated all over the inside of the hotel is that someone cut the power lines while trying to steal it,1
472,so due to the smell water and lack of security this is one of the better off property hotels ive stayed at,1
473,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
474,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
475,from the warm greeting at check-in when i found out for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
476,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but was just too out of it,1
477,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
478,basically its old very old building in the heart of times square the marriott marquis is one of my favorite hotels,1
479,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet paper or complimentary soaps,1
480,breakfast area had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm had to ask for new towels and take my trash out myself,1

484,i will be registering a complaint with the board of health should look into the cleanliness of this place,1
485,gave us a room that had a extra tv on the floor and fingerprints on mirrors,1
486,it was not easily found and when i arrived the front desk attendant was not very hospitable and somewhat dismissive,1
487,we booked one night because of the location and the other was price,1
488,toilet was coming off the floor hair all over the bathroom even trails of ants in the sink area,1
489,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
490,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
491,our room was dirty mildew in the tub and a shower door that came off the track,1
492,worst comfort inn that i have stayed in the was the worst,1
493,first night when checked in assigned room was not made again moved to another room,1
494,00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms,1
495,terrible front desk service dirty and old rooms feces in the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
496,was very dirty the only good thing about this stay,1
497,went to talk to the front desk and he told me fine just leave,1
498,i was told that you might damage the room or make the bed or change the sheets,1
499,the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in years,1
500,we stayed at sleep inn at harbour view over the weekend of 9 10 16-9 11 16,1

502,will never stay at a red roof inn and had a great stay there,1
503,paid 100 and then changed our mind after seeing the room was i was tired and ready to go to bed,1
504,i called this hotel directly and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
505,thought it would be a decent place to sleep,1
506,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management at this hotel is horrible,1
507,the hotel was filthy and i ended up having to take one room,1
508,didn't even say hello as we walked in we were not greeted by the desk help,1
509,this was very clean but other than that this hotel was a disappointment,1
510,granted it is 4:30am in the morning but coffee was spot on,1
511,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
512,not only was the tub not jetted i didn't even use the bathroom because i didn't declare,1
513,i asked for a non-smoking two beds part but microwave and fridge,1
514,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a nursing home,1
515,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
516,going to be in abilene for more than a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
517,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
518,first off when we got there and the hotel was sold out,1
519,i said that we didn't stay terrible location,1
520,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
521,this hotel was so bad that we couldn't even hear the tv,1
522,they charged my card after i made the reservation when i was told it was not available in the pool area,1
523,dirtiest nasty hotel i've stayed at ever,1
524,this was my first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
525,so bad i didn't even feel clean,1
526,we stopped before a flight for a cheap room but i did have to pay for transportation and both hotels,1
527,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
528,this place was affordable only reason why we stayed here is because it was a last minute deal,1
529,the 150 charge was a fee as they claimed i smoked in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock did not work properly,1
530,on the way to room it literally looked like we were in a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking room,1
531,first of all there was only one towel in the room,1
532,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
533,i understand there was a wrestling tournament and chose this hotel for the indoor pool don't bother,1
534,then i saw that there was a 45 minute wait,1
535,however we did get a non-smoking room stank of smoke,1
536,didn't get the room i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
537,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
538,when i called front desk and he said he would notify manager lisa,1
539,we tried to close the curtains but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
540,it was the worst experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
541,this room was a little better but there was a huge stain next to the bed,1
542,unfortunately this was the only place accepting pets and we didn't bother to stay,1
543,the room was terrible and it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
544,the first room i checked into had a bad smell was dark with only a tiny window cigarette burn in bed,1
545,guess they were not happy with our stay,1
546,entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the non-smoking room,1
547,dirty room with cokroch in bed hair all over the walls and bottom of the door to your room,1
548,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
549,the elevators smelled like i don't know what they were made of plastic,1
550,i cant say one good thing about this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
551,this is one of the worst ones i have stayed at and enjoyed the chestnut hotel before but we were very disappointed,1
552,i was told to come back the next day to not go in our room but my mothers room across the hall,1
553,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
554,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
555,all we wanted was a place to sleep this isn't even worth it,1
556,should have stayed in the car but it was too late for us to find another hotel,1
557,all i was able to use it,1
558,i informed him about what happened and he said he would find one and get back to me,1
559,failed to mention there was a bar attached to the hotel in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are,1
560,i did not stay as i did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids,1
561,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
562,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the phone,1
563,guess they were not happy with our stay here,1
564,horrible experience with this property will never book with comfort suites in the future,1
565,back later to change rooms nobody at the front desk were nothing short of astonishing,1
566,well the next day we found out that the swimming pool was broke and hot tub were broke,1
567,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
568,i will not be staying again and it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
569,never going back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
570,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
571,no room service while we were out but that was it,1
572,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1
573,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to keep it,1
574,i'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
575,when i woke up i had to call hotels twice never again,1
576,had they not had my credit card on wednesday when i checked in around 10p,1
577,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
578,staff was very nice and very helpful and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
579,it is not a safe place to stay,1
580,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
581,the pool and spa were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
582,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
583,it took me 3 hours to get someone to come down,1
584,the conditions of the rooms was stinking so badly that we had to work it out with the it tech from some other company,1
585,we check in and found that ac in room was not working correctly and still very hot at night,1
586,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even worth the price we paid,1
587,the toilet bowls were yello looked like they have not been washed in years,1
588,location this hotel is right in the middle of time square but the rooms are dirty the bath dirty kitchen is too old,1
589,in newburgh which had a sunday special price but upon arrival the front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20,1
590,the reservation was wrong and i had to check in through a window slot,1
591,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
592,we booked this hotel through southwest airlines and when we arrived the attendant was standing outside smoking,1
593,their idea of a continental breakfast was a danish and an apple,1
594,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and the staff of the 4 seasons very professional,1
595,i booked a room through expedia-not a good experience at all,1
596,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
597,the hotel was fine but not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
598,the front office staff was great but the cleaning crew was horrible,1
599,but after three hours later after we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
600,banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
601,sheets were still damp and the smell was outrageous,1
602,the rooms were dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed but told none were available,1
603,the room was a nice size and quiet,1
604,this motel should be torn down and rebuilt,1
605,they were unprofessional and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
606,when i opened the shower curtain to take a shower and there was no hot water for our entire stay,1
607,this place is absolutely the worst hospitality experience that i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
608,if this place had bed bugs it would have been nice to use during our stay,1
609,nothing's going to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
610,we went to stay at the end of the building,1
611,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
612,the bathtub was dirty the bathroom looked like it was kicked in the room had a horrible smell so requested a new one,1
613,so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room was pick up the alarm clock why dont know,1

615,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
616,we walk into our room and i was told it was on the beach,1
617,the first hiccup in this stay was the room was clean but that only thing,1
618,no one in my family got ready that morning and there was no hot water for an early morning shower,1
619,when we got there they gave us a complimentry king room upgrade,1

638,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was musty and humid,1

741,didn't even say hello as we walked in we were not greeted by the desk help,1
742,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the toilet not what you think,1
743,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
744,cons walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the room next to us with both at a much cheaper rate,1
745,we checked in at 8:00pm and when we got there you could tell that it was old,1
746,we did not feel safe in the hotel room and was completed and utterly disgusted,1
747,they said that was the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
748,also they could add additional fee that i did not want to be charged for another night since we were canceling our reservation,1
749,i read the reviews before i made my reservation that the ambassador inn,1
750,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the couch looks like something they,1
751,the front desk didn't have a single craft beer,1
752,the hotel was going under renovation while we were there we told them about it,1
753,and to top it off we went in the room after a long trip i didn't say anything more to him about it,1
754,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
755,room 1013 lighting issues broken lamp tv did not function properly in fact the deadbolt did not work,1
756,my 1-year-old 3-year-old husband and myself walked around the room barefoot for an hour and her,1
757,one more think the parking lot is full of potholes,1
758,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
759,i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but i would not recommend this hotel at all,1
760,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
761,i was told to take it up with the manager in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
762,i'm appalled by this place and it scared them straight,1
763,we booked a king room and when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the lot,1
764,it was not worth the price charged and i would not stay in this hotel,1
765,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to a different hotel,1
766,it was 90 when we arrived and the a c was too small to cool the entire room down,1
767,toilet was coming off the floor hair all over the bathroom even trails of ants in the sink area,1
768,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
769,i called back and the assistant manager picked up and said oh yes mr,1
770,so dirty that i could not even get my wheelchair into the bathroom,1
771,there was a big problem in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some,1
772,they put us on the first floor next to the bed and next to the mirror over the sink,1
773,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
774,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a worse experience,1
775,i went to the front desk in the morning was clueless,1
776,there were hookers and crack heads staying there and wandering in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
777,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room,1
778,after a twelve hour drive from georgia my husband i were very tired and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
779,room was filthy had bugs crawling up the wall another fell on the floor,1
780,based on this needless to say i cancelled the second night and went to stay at another hotel last minute,1
781,we checked in 5 minutes later we were at the front desk couldn't find my reservation,1
782,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
783,i asked about changing rooms and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
784,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the hotel and the room itself was fine nothing impressive but that was expected,1
785,horrible sounds because of the airport and there is no refund now i know why,1
786,the room still have the towels used from that morning on the floor the door to the stairs across from,1
787,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through a wall of water pouring through the ceiling,1
788,on our way through the casino floor security tool me to the front desk and they did send a repair man right over,1
789,i asked to talk to a supervisor was told that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed,1
790,the person at the desk said he had to take my number for the manager and assured us we would get a refund,1
791,second room was clean but there is a door between 2 rooms and you can hear everyone come off the elevator,1
792,upon getting the second room we had to go buy lysol and spray everything,1
793,we arrived at burnsville and the motel has changed names so we had to find another hotel we would have,1
794,when i got to my room on the second floor and as soon as we woke up,1
795,this has to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
796,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1
797,the door looked like it had not been wiped down properly,1
798,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person had an attitude the whole time,1
799,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
800,did not like the hotel room as it wasn't clean i could stop by,1

804,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
805,so dirty and bad hotel this hotel should not even be a one star,1
806,went to take a shower there was hair hanging from the shower and dried phlegm on the wall by the door casing,1
807,my stay was ok i didn't know that i have to pay a cancellation fee for such terrible service,1
808,so dirty and bad hotel this hotel should not even be associated with this establishment,1
809,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
810,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
811,i was greeted by two homeless men sitting in the parking lot and yell at our group,1
812,what a bargain right when we arrived we waited 10 minutes for the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
813,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1
814,i arrived at the hotel and was told that they were pet friendly,1
815,tv kept turning off called the front desk and they never fixed it,1
816,one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had,1
817,i was told they only have the small room with 2 double beds at this location using the hotel chains website lq,1
818,furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1

820,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
821,the pool and spa were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
822,arrive at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking room the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
823,the lady at the front desk checking out,1
824,unfortunately i was unable to take pictures of the room to go kill time,1
825,this is the part of the staff here,1
826,we just did not feel safe and the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
827,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the hotel could use some updating,1
828,the bathroom ceiling above the shower looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
829,the receptionist said they didn't have another room available,1
830,will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
831,casino was fine but i will never go there again,1
832,i realized after staying here that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed,1
833,upon entrance to our room we were moved out of the room to go kill time,1
834,people were smoking everywhere so i couldn't keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
835,people living in an rv in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
836,we were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
837,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
838,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was close to my parents which is the only reason why i stayed there,1
839,climate control in the room and we left,1
840,the front desk clerk said she did not know what they were made of plastic,1
841,so we had to go somewhere else but all area hotels where booked so i did not have a fridge very disappointed,1
842,asked for a refund or discount and the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
843,i asked about changing rooms and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
844,and this was on a non-smoking room we entered,1
845,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
846,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
847,the front desk lied to us when we checked in at 8:00pm and when we got back,1
848,i called them and hotels and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
849,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks left feet or socks black,1
850,when we reported this to the front desk and were told that the room we had needed a deep clean,1
851,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
852,then i saw that there was a big problem in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
853,there were cigarette burns on the bed and left for the afternoon,1
854,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most dishusting hotel ive ever been to,1
855,it didn't appear any construction was going on in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's,1
856,when we arrived there was no one at the counter,1
857,the room or hotel itself is nothing like the pictures on the internet are very deceiving,1
858,the bathroom was dirty there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo,1
859,would never recommend this place to my enemies,1
860,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
861,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
862,stay away ppl worst hotel i've stayed at this location many times,1
863,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
864,when asked to speak to the manager because of the way i was dressed certainly didn't look like a cyclist no,1
865,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far one of the worst hotel i've stayed at ever,1
866,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
867,there was a wad of hair on the floor and they will replace them,1
868,our room had a bad smell to it and hair was found on the floor when we shut the door,1
869,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
870,the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
871,called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
872,the individual at the front desk to find out,1
873,i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
874,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of signs telling you what you can not do,1
875,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
876,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
877,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
878,it could be a smoke smell but we had a non-smoking room smelled of smoke that had,1
879,the jacuzzi was filthy i took pictures it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
880,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
881,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
882,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
883,the heater in the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
884,the door looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in weeks,1
885,i was desperate for a room and it was impossible to change to non smoking,1
886,my wife checked the credit card and the company said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean yet very worn,1
887,i would never recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
888,we left and will never go back and stay there,1
889,we were forced to move to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1
890,i'm appalled by this place and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
891,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
892,i immediately called the hotel and sent us to another property and paid for the room through expedia i knew i had to stay,1
893,the bathtub was black in the bottom from dirt looks like it hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
894,there was a air purifier in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get it,1
895,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and i had asked about the men in the parking lot all night,1
896,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and i went up to look at the complaint of the customer,1
897,the apple juice and orange juice it looked like it was not very clean,1
898,view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there was no manager available so,1
899,hotel sits in the middle of the night,1
900,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no available rooms because of the,1
901,room was ok for a 1 night stay this is not a 3,1
902,well 4:30 am arrives and the front desk woman was rude,1
903,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the bathroom said please lets just take this,1
904,called the front desk and he said he would find one and get back to me the same day,1
905,the room had a bad odor and the air conditioning didn't work and the front desk was no help,1
906,the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the a c was not on in the room,1
907,the hotel location is probably the only good thing out of the stay is a full refund,1
908,my wife and i stayed at this hotel,1
909,i also noticed that there was a 45 minute wait,1
910,the telephone in our room didn't work,1
911,i guess that's why you don't have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
912,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
913,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
914,could not get cold water we had to let the water run for a while and not to use hot water,1
915,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not do anything about houskeeping,1
916,i knew i made a bad mistake when i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
917,the free cookies at the front desk that we would not be able to conduct business,1
918,there was mold in the bathroom and everyday we had to go get,1
919,after seeing the dead bugs in the room and now available at front desk because they were booked,1
920,the room smelled rotten the lock on the door need to be fix the tv didn't work at all,1
921,i slept in my vehicle in a rest stop would be 5 star compared to this place,1
922,what i do have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
923,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i were so mad we went back to say we couldn't stay there,1
924,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
925,no hot water manager acted like he didn't care about the situation he told us to go to the lobby without her,1
926,as the title suggests i'd have been better off just sleeping in my truck or in a tent,1
927,the sheets had holes and the shower didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
928,stayed the week before and didn't have any smoking rooms left but when i got to the room the linen was full of hair,1
929,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
930,when i complained the manager said there was nothing she could do due to the fact that we found a much better hotel,1
931,lol then he offered us another room and they told us there were none available,1
932,service person said drain was full of hair grossed me out hair and dirt in toilet and the shower was very dirty,1
933,i was booked paid in full for a room that we pre-paid,1
934,if you ever go to the front desk and the night auditor made me,1
935,the room was carpeting in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
936,this was probably one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1
937,the telephone in our room didn't work,1
938,we were two families staying in this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
939,not worth staying at this hotel and i had to check out the following day,1
940,this was a horrible stay we were able to park in the parking lot directly in front of the pool,1
941,i booked through hotels and when i got to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
942,during our two night stay there was someone smoking on the second floor stunk of smoke and made our eyes tear up,1
943,because we got in so late there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
944,was relieved to move next door to the comfort inn for the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
945,and i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even call,1
946,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
947,we were put in a room the first night where construction was going on just looked like all the water was drained out of it,1
948,got the feeling that they were aware of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
949,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
950,they advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in grand rapids we opted to stay here,1
951,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
952,i called the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it then when i was about to get into the bathroom,1
953,my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1
954,do not stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
955,plug in located in bathroom didn't work the floor was weak in places there were stains on the comforter,1
956,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
957,the mgr put me in another room that had double beds,1
958,the most uncomfortable beds you can think of i can say something bad about,1
959,the room was terrible and it was in the process of getting our refund and dealing with the bank and the hotel,1
960,instead of remodeling this hotel should be taken off the list,1
961,this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
962,i'm a hhilton member so i choose this hotel because it allowed pets,1
963,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled just like the rest of the room was never cleaned in the 10 days i stayed there,1
964,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
965,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
966,i called the front desk and they just said,1
967,however this time when we checked in no one was at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
968,there were dead spiders bugs all over the bathroom no sheets on the bed were not clean,1
969,the furniture in the room old and outdated but it is not accessible to wheelchair users and they don't care,1
970,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
971,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
972,we both woke up in the middle by bailing wire,1
973,no towels in room we had to deal with nonsense from an incompetent employee,1
974,1 when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
975,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was musty and humid,1
976,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
977,the only thing good about this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
978,i asked the front desk if i could cancel and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
979,i guess that's why you don't have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
980,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was an extra 30 per night,1
981,bed uncomfortable and the middle of the night thinking the ceiling was going to cave in,1
982,so to end this from ever happening again i will never use this company again nor recommend it to anyone,1
983,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of signs telling you what you can not do,1
984,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
985,and we asked the front desk for issues the girl working the front desk on our first night,1
986,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1
987,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel at 4:30pm and we were informed that we would get them the next day,1
988,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
989,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
990,peeling wallpaper and mold in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
991,the front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1
992,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1
993,while i agree that the staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
994,this was by far one of the worst places i have ever stayed in,1
995,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and were nasty,1
996,i'm asking for my money back and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
997,so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room and the condition it was in and left,1
998,it was such a bad hotel in a bad area not horrible and the hotel room was 85 degrees and very musty,1
999,we were in the water and could not take a bath had to use shower 4,1
1000,when i tried to take a shower to attend an event,1
1001,the mattress was on top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs badly,1
1002,the ceiling above the shower looked as if it was unused for a year or more,1
1003,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
1004,once in the room the a c leaking inside the room and decided i could not stay,1
1005,took forever to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is a hotel factory,1
1006,we had 2 rooms and my family and i stayed at the best western recommended this establishment what a mistake,1
1007,i stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
1008,when we got in the room it's filthy and bugs are crawling around,1
1009,when i woke up i had to call hotels to dispute the charges,1
1010,i repeat do not stay here it was so bad that the towels and bedding were completely wet,1
1011,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
1012,unfortunately i was not able cause the wall behind it will move back,1
1013,i do not recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car than in this place,1
1014,we were there for the whole weekend and i asked for extra towels they would only give us half of our money back,1
1015,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
1016,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
1017,they did not have the option to go anywhere else for the night,1
1018,i took my dog outside once during the night and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
1019,furniture in the room was not very clean,1
1020,we stopped before a flight for a cheap room but i did have to pay for it i still haven't received the call,1
1021,the bed linens were tissue paper thin and the bed was extremely uncomfortable,1
1022,the hotel was only 43 a night and it was such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
1023,we left and will never go back and stay there,1
1024,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
1025,i never felt safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty,1
1026,i arrived at 10:30 at night and did not have any regular coffee for the type of coffee pot in the room,1
1027,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
1028,the room was dirty the curtains had holes there wasn't any coffee cups or water cups,1
1029,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
1030,the person at the front desk and they just said,1
1031,the front desk is vacant most of the time did not work at all,1
1032,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower,1
1033,unfortainatley there were people in out of the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
1034,this hotel charged my card for 2 rooms,1
1035,breakfast person was apologetic but after waiting in line for the other 20 minute,1
1036,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
1037,i didn't stay the second night but they wouldn't adjust the price,1
1038,and this was on a non-smoking room it reeked of cigarette smoke and it did not have central air conditioning,1
1039,when i called the front desk and they never fixed it,1
1040,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
1041,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
1042,the hotel was so sketchy that i could not even look at the rest of the restaurant,1
1043,it was not a good experience at all,1
1044,the resort itself was very nice and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
1045,i selected a non-smoking room stank of smoke,1
1046,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of hours,1
1047,and the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
1048,they charge me extra for her in the same room and at the same time,1
1049,prior to checking in i called the front desk from our cell phone and again they brought us towels offered to change our room,1
1050,i've stayed in a lot of hotels motels around where this place is so dirty,1
1051,the room or hotel itself is nothing like the pictures on line do not look anything like the rooms once you get there,1
1052,this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
1053,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
1054,living room had no light and the smell of smoke was so strong we knew we would not be checking into the hotel,1
1055,our receipt from hotels said there was room service but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
1056,not the worst place i have ever been in,1
1057,we needed separate beds and the room we were assigned should not have been used,1
1058,i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
1059,although the location is great close to the beach it was not worth the money,1
1060,it was 90 when we arrived and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
1061,the hotel and rooms had a bad smell dirty carpets and stained ceiling,1
1062,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
1063,the only good thing about our stay at this hotel tge last 2 nights,1
1064,don't stay on the first floor next to the bed and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
1065,after the front desk person didn't try to help me at all,1
1066,that was horrible experience i wish i could have stayed at any hotel and chose this one,1
1067,when it was our turn we immediately explained that we were going to eat al together,1
1068,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
1069,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
1070,i always book through hotels and have never before stayed in one with no place to stay,1
1071,i cant say one good thing about it is the two cats who live there,1
1072,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up having to take one room,1
1073,she said to call the manager in the morning and at times i thought i smelled sewage,1
1074,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
1075,i paid for two nights but did not stay after checking in and finding out about the hold the hotel did nothing to stop him,1
1076,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
1077,lastly we asked for a roll away bed and was told they would have the room cleaned,1
1078,and the bed was comfortable but there was a leak in our room,1
1079,she gave me a key so i can check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me,1
1080,the service was terrible the hotel staff was not very considerate to its guest,1
1081,the pool was closed for repairs which was one of the worst hotels i have ever been,1
1082,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
1083,for starters the lady at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
1084,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the price charged and i would not stay here,1
1085,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites and would not return even if i was homeless,1
1086,it didn't appear any construction was going on in room above us,1
1087,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
1088,this was the worst hotel i ever been,1
1089,checked out 4 hours after check in and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue,1
1090,carpet in the room was old and in need of repair,1
1091,those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved but was told there are only so many rooms available,1
1092,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk was very argumentative and rude,1
1093,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
1094,i got to the hotel after the allowed check-in time we were told that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
1095,they may be doing some remodeling but what we saw on our stay was not a good hospitality and rude staff,1
1096,guess i need to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1
1097,when i went to checkout i didn't even use the bathroom because i didn't have a single craft beer,1
1098,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk and was told well what would you like me to do,1
1099,the room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
1100,when we returned to the hotel at 11 pm after a long day of traveling and meetings,1
1101,went back to get a different room and was told no the earliest will,1
1102,there was some stuff on top of one of the drugs an i am not talking tobacco,1
1103,would never recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
1104,despite being a non smoking hotel my room reeked of smoke cigarette burns in the dirty recliner,1
1105,this hotel was so bad that i booked 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
1106,the air did not work so drove walked to front desk and they said they would get someone to look at it,1
1107,i was booked paid in full for a room that had a extra tv on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained,1
1108,everywhere i looked in our room and when i turned the sheets back it was clear that they were not clean,1
1109,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated since the 70's,1
1110,i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
1111,she then called us back and told us that we had to ask at the front desk in case something happens to it,1
1112,very noisy stray cat came in the room old and outdated but it is not very clean as you see discarded trash under the nightstand,1
1113,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was available and that i did not order on it,1
1114,first off let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a days inn again,1
1115,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
1116,my suite door look like it hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
1117,i did inquire if the room was grimy and reeked,1
1118,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
1119,after the cold night i went to take a shower and there was no blow dryer,1
1120,there was no one one at the front desk said there was nothing wrong with the card,1
1121,a sticker on the bathroom door had been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch,1
1122,needless to say i couldn't wait to get out in the morning,1
1123,there was accumulated dust all around the room and when i went to check out and then he would refund the price,1
1124,the hotel staff was very rude i wouldn't never recommend or stay at a howard johnson it only took this one time,1
1125,i will never and i mean never stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
1126,we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
1127,after two more tries we contacted the front desk and was told well what would you like me to do,1
1128,walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
1129,so the pool was out of order,1
1130,the breakfast person was nice and helpful but the rooms and the persons in the hotel dont care,1
1131,i then got to my room the tv did not want to walk on without shoes,1
1132,they figured cause i was from out of town and we stayed at this hotel before,1
1133,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the hotel could use some updating,1
1134,back later to change rooms nobody at the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
1135,we came here and ask that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
1136,i don't think i'll be back later since i'm house hunting,1
1137,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
1138,firstly you must know that this is a motel not a hotel,1
1139,this hotel is quite run down and in desperate need of updates and remodel,1
1140,the night manager was very nice but we will never go back to the this hotel gran malia victoria in mayorca,1
1141,once we were finally checked in we were charged an extra 40 for a non smoking room and so did the chair in room,1
1142,the hotel is in a bad neighborhood,1
1143,this hotel should not be on this website,1
1144,when i went down to the desk no one answered the courtesy phone,1
1145,when i booked this room for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it again,1
1146,we went and asked to be let in,1
1147,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
1148,this was a horrible stay because the room was 88 degrees,1
1149,very cheap in price if that is what you are looking for comfort do not choose this location,1
1150,we stayed multiple nights and had to go back and find my second room,1
1151,my husband spoke with the manager who did nothing,1
1152,as other reviews have said the continental breakfast was only cereal toast waffles coffee milk oj,1
1153,this was my 2nd stay at super 8 my last the room smelled of mildew the stove fridge and shower were broken,1
1154,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
1155,i understand there was a wrestling tournament and chose this hotel for the weekend,1
1156,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
1157,you should not be able to stay there,1
1158,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
1159,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
1160,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
1161,the place was filthy and there were holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
1162,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
1163,this place sucks i would never stay there again and can not recommend it,1
1164,the reservation was wrong and i had to change rooms first day,1
1165,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to call to find the place,1
1166,i went and told the man that we,1
1167,if you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay in advance and there is no refund now i know why,1
1168,while i agree that the staff is friendly but you can tell they never clean it,1
1169,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty,1
1170,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and we were tired so i said give us what you have,1
1171,we went to go look at her room it had not been vacuumed in a long time very dirty with pieces of trash all over,1
1172,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
1173,banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning and he didn't even care,1
1174,manager the next day said i should have let her know sooner,1
1175,they are going to look at the complaint of the customer,1
1176,i was never so happy to check out of the room next door all night imagine my surprise when i,1
1177,i will never stay at this hotel for business because my company picked it,1
1178,hotels employee mar told me i would have to say this was unacceptable,1
1179,i was told i could get a key for the room,1
1180,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find a room in an area with none,1
1181,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means,1
1182,the carpet was slimy sticky and there were stains on the couch they tryed to clean and the black couch arms yuck,1
1183,spent my night sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a tent,1
1184,we walked into the room i just cried,1
1185,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it the environment or the community,1
1186,light stopped working from the switch had to turn it on and off under the sink,1
1187,i booked 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect clean sheets and a clean blanket,1
1188,when i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
1189,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
1190,we saved for a very long time including the metal doors,1
1191,i looked for the ac and tried to turn it on with the knob u had to turn it on,1
1192,this is the second worst hotel experience ever,1
1193,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know if i hit the proprietor on a,1
1194,there not towels in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
1195,this was the only place accepting pets and we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room,1
1196,woke up to no hot water for an early morning shower,1
1197,i had to cancel my reservation upon booking i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
1198,watered down waffle mix apple juice and orange juice it looked like it was kicked in the room had an awful smell to it,1
1199,this property is a horrible location in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1
1200,the 3rd room had another smell we also discovered several bugs in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
1201,was not worth the money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
1202,when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
1203,oh and the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
1204,so i called the front desk to ask for another room and they said sorry were sold out,1
1205,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a large gap around the door,1
1206,that was the only good thing about this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1
1207,we did not sleep well we both woke up in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
1208,very cheap in price if that is what you are looking for a miserable stay for the weekend this is the place,1
1209,my stay at the motel 6 next door proved this was not the best experience the front desk staff was helpful and friendly,1
1210,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
1211,when we got there we had to beg for toilet paper,1
1212,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1
1213,she didn't offer to move me and was told there were no other rooms to switch to,1
1214,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
1215,would not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
1216,to unlock to get into the shower i noticed several pieces of hair all over the walls in different areas of the room,1
1217,i should have known the rooms would have been disgusting by the smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins,1
1218,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained and dirty so slept on top of them,1
1219,went to the front desk first thing in the morning i was told sorry there is no other rooms available,1
1220,upon arrival the first thing we noticed was it was not a clean place to stay never again,1
1221,roaches shower didn't work and i had to check in through a window slot,1
1222,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
1223,the shower in the master bath did not work and no towels in first room,1
1224,i arrived at 4:00 pm my reserved room was not ready when we arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk,1
1225,so i went back down to the desk and told here we couldn't stay there,1
1226,we stayed there this time last year with an adequate room with a view this past weekend and it was a great hotel,1
1227,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and bed had a big dip in it,1
1228,bad place overall even if you don't like it i don't like this part what do you want,1
1229,was a cold night and the at the desk put us in a basement room when the majority of the hotel was a huge pain,1
1230,the pool and spa were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
1231,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was decent,1
1232,the room was dirty smelled of cigarette it was a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking and couldn't get anything right,1
1233,there were also body hairs in the shower when we got there they gave us a complimentry king room upgrade,1
1234,staff stole 4 000 out of our room on ground floor,1
1235,i checked in requesting a non smoking room and the one i got was broken,1
1236,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was perfectly located,1
1237,i ask for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk that we would not be checking into the hotel,1
1238,when we reported this to the front desk to change the bedding and left for the day,1
1239,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't really separated,1
1240,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
1241,and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk and picked up phone filthy,1
1242,bathroom old and i didn't stay the second night but they wouldn't look at it,1
1243,sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get checked in get ready and go to the function,1
1244,the room was dirty the couch was soiled i was scared to sleep in the car because there was no available rooms because of the,1
1245,the most uncomfortable room and bed i have yet to get an email back,1
1246,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a cockroach in the bathtub,1
1247,it was very discussing they delayed our check in time because they said they were completely booked i couldn't get another room,1
1248,bad place overall even if you don't mind fleas and unclean sheets,1
1249,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
1250,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the bath towels had black dirty stains,1
1251,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
1252,in recent years my wife and i have stayed at super 8's before and had no trouble,1
1253,besides the foul unusual smell in the hotel room as well as steps leading up to the second floor,1
1254,found a stranger's long black hair in the shower wall and remained there the whole time of our stay,1
1255,this was the worst hotel room and hotel i've ever stayed in ever,1
1256,well the next day we found out that the swimming pool was on the small size but clean,1
1257,when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there were black flying bugs in the bathroom,1
1258,most disgusting room i've ever been in,1
1259,our friends we were traveling with a group of senior citizens,1
1260,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building but this would put me a stones throw from the highway,1
1261,he said it was a night cancellation fee and i did not sleep well at all the night we stayed,1
1262,i was told to take it up with the manager in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
1263,not kept up as well and lots of bugs in the heater in the room didn't work and the refrigerator didn't work,1
1264,when we finally got into our room and that was the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
1265,well to start off the front desk person didn't care,1
1266,if we weren't so tired and the room was not clean sheets severely stained and mattress in a plastic cover,1
1267,for the price paid 100 and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
1268,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a days inn ever again,1
1269,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
1270,we came upstairs to look at the complaint of the customer,1
1271,there was old body fluids on the floor at the end of my long day of hiking through yellowstone,1
1272,the bathroom counter top was the only nice thing i can say is that the sheets were clean,1
1273,the front desk did offer to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
1274,wouldn't stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
1275,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the dirtiest place i have ever stayed in,1
1276,i went and it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
1277,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
1278,needless to say we did not stay at the ambassador suite gain,1
1279,firstly you must know that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
1280,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
1281,there were ants in my room and have tried to contact a manger multiple times and have yet to get an email back,1
1282,i found roaches in the room the water wouldn't work in the morning,1
1283,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor where our room was the balcony was not safe,1
1284,worse stay i've ever had to stay in this motel,1
1285,went to take a shower and noticed there were no towels in the bathroom and one under a table in the room,1
1286,great location it may not look like it did on line,1
1287,i was told the carpet in the room needs a good cleaning,1
1288,i called to the front desk to change the bedding and left for the day at about 10 am,1
1289,the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like a pet toilet,1
1290,bathtub did not drain and on the second day when they cleaned the room they folded the dirty towels on the floor like new,1
1291,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
1292,i will have a hard time with the check in,1
1293,he gave us the room key and without realizing the room had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm had to ask for clean towels,1
1294,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
1295,we got to the hotel the guy at desk said that the rooms were sold out but during i stayed there for 4 days,1
1296,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room with a queen or king bed,1
1297,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
1298,crossing the border from canada we were given a new set to put on the bed,1
1299,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
1300,this has to be the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
1301,when we returned the next night we opened the door and we were immediately hit with a terrible stench,1
1302,when i complained the manager said there was nothing wrong with the card the hotel should have called me,1
1303,on a more positive note the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
1304,i had to call the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself,1
1305,they didn't have any key cards so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
1306,i am a person that reads reviews but i have never written a negative review but this was a terrible experience,1
1307,i asked to talk to a supervisor was told that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed,1
1308,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
1309,they are cheap but you don't even get what you pay for and sometimes you don't even get that,1
1310,when we returned to the hotel room motel style,1
1311,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
1312,the tiles were missing all over the bathroom there was blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
1313,the front desk attendant was very unprofessional and the general manager would not come out of the office as quickly as possible after breakfast,1
1314,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel with a very lodge-like feel,1
1315,we will never stay there again and would not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
1316,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
1317,the place was dirty and not cleaned well,1
1318,i didn't know that i have to pay a cancellation fee for such terrible service,1
1319,people were standing outside of my room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
1320,we arrived and were told our room was not clean sheets severely stained and mattress in a plastic cover,1
1321,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
1322,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk was extremely friendly that's where the good part of the experience,1
1323,this was probably the worst casino hotel room i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
1324,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
1325,it had hair on the toilet and dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the a couple beds some human some dog,1
1326,i bring a small travel fan and don't have a king size bed with no blankets,1
1327,we did not like the hotel room as it was dirty and not maintained,1
1328,our room had a bad odor and the air conditioning didn't work in the shower,1
1329,we needed separate beds and the room we were assigned should not have been in use,1
1330,i called and complained and the hotel manager says that they will not refund my second night despite my complaints,1
1331,the room was dirty when we checked in the front desk informed the hotel is overbooked,1
1332,when we arrived florida we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
1333,it reeked of tobacco and we asked for a refund if it wasn't clean and ready for the guess,1
1334,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
1335,the first room we were given a tiny room,1
1336,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so bad it couldn't be slept in,1
1337,i was there on business and the way i was being spoke to did not help at all,1
1338,the sliding door jamm was broken in the room and its cleanliness was questionable,1
1339,i tried to get a refund after the first night the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
1340,first of all the pictures of the property are not true,1
1341,i arrived late and the receptionist insisted that i did not even want to take my shoes off,1
1342,my key did not work and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1
1343,so due to the smell water and lack of security this is one of the better off property hotels ive stayed at,1
1344,we asked for our money back and they said i would have to wait until 11 am to see a live person,1
1345,i'll never recommend this hotel to anyone whatsoever there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
1346,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated in 50 yrs,1
1347,the hotel location is probably the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
1348,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building but this would put me a stones throw from the highway,1
1349,although the location is great close to the beach but not worth the cost of what we paid for,1
1350,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
1351,when we arrived our room was on the first floor next to the bed on floor,1
1352,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room,1
1353,upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the a couple beds some human some dog,1
1354,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute room at 1 am,1
1355,but after three hours later after we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
1356,room was nothing like the pictures they have,1
1357,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk the next morning was the one positive of this stay,1
1358,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room for the night,1
1359,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were not very clean,1
1360,the room was was descent on the inside but with a flat panel tv,1
1361,we would have cancelled that night but it was too late for us to find another hotel,1
1362,we could not open up the sofa bed because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,1
1363,my better half and myself were in town for one night for a wedding and the party staying there i would've gone somewhere else,1
1364,this hotel should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
1365,thought we were going to try to find somewhere else to stay and save yourself the irritation and frustration,1
1366,i asked for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
1367,there we no trash cans in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get it,1
1368,i had bite marks all on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
1369,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
1370,we would have asked for a different room they said they were completely booked i couldn't get my money back,1
1371,on the positive side the bed was comfortable but you can hear,1
1372,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
1373,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated in years,1
1374,we still had to pay for room again,1
1375,internet was very slow and most of the time so if you don't want your car to get vandalized,1
1376,areas of no paint on the bathroom walls holes in the wall broken closet door and no towels or soap,1
1377,never stat at this hotel the same nights,1
1378,we would have cancelled that night but it was too late to do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
1379,i asked her why you don't have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
1380,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
1381,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to request an early check in,1
1382,many other issues but i will never book thru expedia ever again,1
1383,if you ever go to the front desk were very nice and tried to help as much as possible,1
1384,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
1385,the walk way on the third floor and the elevator sounded like it was going to break,1
1386,way over priced for the condition of the hotel was filthy and smelled real bad,1
1387,they also kept asking if we wanted to shower as each room had one unbelievable issue after another,1
1388,ironically the inside of the hotel is beautiful and luxurious just as expected,1
1389,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
1390,my tv in the room had an odd smell,1
1391,we arrived on time in the front and they said they had none to move us too,1
1392,got a smoking room when we were supposed to get smelled horrific of cigarette smoke,1
1393,another manager came in and told us that we had to work it out and bare with the horrible condition but had to move out,1
1394,we stayed at sleep inn at harbour view over the weekend of 9 10 16-9 11 16,1
1395,to top it all off they didn't even have an ice machine,1
1396,i booked this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
1397,but as i booked end prepaid through hotels dot com and why we would still be charged,1
1398,2 towels no hand towels no bathing towels,1
1399,it was the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
1400,even the lobby had a funny smell and the room was labeled as such,1
1401,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and i didnt get a refund,1
1402,i got angry and then he said i didn't have to sleep in a dingy room anyway,1
1403,road noise was horrible when the window was open and would bark endlessly,1
1404,this was one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had,1
1405,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
1406,she didn't offer to move me and i told her i would have to pay for transportation and both hotels,1
1407,i did not stay at this place again,1
1408,the windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
1409,when we walked in the staff was very nice extremely personable and friendly,1
1410,we could hear every conversation from the room next to us had many visitors all hours of the night,1
1411,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room,1
1412,i made a reservation for a non smoking room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
1413,i'm an ihg gold member and i have stayed here several times in the past this last time was horrible,1
1414,i knew i made a bad mistake when i went to the room but when i laid on the bed it smelt odd,1
1415,my better half and myself were in town for an extended period due to their job,1
1416,we were having a family reunion 4 rooms and there were no rooms available around the area,1
1417,i booked one room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
1418,but other than that this hotel was a former baymont inn that has not been renovated or keep up since except the obnoxious color outside,1
1419,on the second night there we saw 7 cop cars when we got back again there was water all over the floor,1
1420,i called and complained and the hotel manager says that they will not refund my second night despite my complaints,1
1421,my advice only book this hotel if you have another choice,1
1422,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
1423,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had air conditioner appeared that was not working correctly,1
1424,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
1425,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
1426,if you are planning a trip to the batesville oxford area i would suggest that unless your life depended on it don't stay here,1
1427,i am upset because i didn't want to refund my money but the police made them,1
1428,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what my total was for the night,1
1429,the bathroom had a hair in the shower and on towels,1
1430,i took pictures of the room to go kill time,1
1431,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
1432,the only good thing about this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
1433,when we arrived there was no one to come clean it,1
1434,we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
1435,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
1436,and when it's 94 degrees outside that would have been nice to know that the hotel was under construction,1
1437,the door to our room we opened the door to the room literally would not open because of the bed,1
1438,expedia was wonderful and gave us a new set but at this point i'm not sure if it the environment or the community,1
1439,i asked if it was ocean and was told it was non smoking i couldn't get towels for my room,1
1440,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
1441,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
1442,got in the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
1443,when i went down to the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
1444,the bath room and shower was filthy with dirt bathroom tub full of rust dirt and it was just disgusting,1
1445,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
1446,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
1447,i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds at this hotel paying extra for our requested bed type,1
1448,the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
1449,i called tuesday morning to speak with the owner who was nit there,1
1450,i was there on business and the way i was being spoke to did not help at all,1
1451,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
1452,carpet in the room was in much need of updating,1
1453,additionally they charge us duoble of its regular price due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming,1
1454,this was the worst motel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
1455,ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
1456,yes its very cheap but not worth it because we had to pay for this room to attend our daughter's college graduation,1
1457,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
1458,the next day we found out that the swimming pool was on the small size but clean,1
1459,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience i can't even get them to help me,1
1460,had dinner one night in the room and the fireplace,1
1461,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and bits of hair everywhere in the bathroom on the vanity in our room,1
1462,when we went to the front desk to request one,1
1463,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated in years,1
1464,i tried to call the front desk and they said they will call me back to solve the problem,1
1465,we booked the room late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
1466,they sent up maintenance to the room and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
1467,you can see the outside through the bottom of the door had a hole in it,1
1468,this is our first time staying at this hotel the same nights,1
1469,the room was dirty smelled of cigarette it was a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
1470,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
1471,i was given a room key when i checked the bed in the new room was warm but nothing special,1
1472,will not ever be coming back to this place and it scared them straight,1
1473,it was not what i booked or paid for and there was no gravy and a half of biscuit on display folks not cool,1
1474,not completely horrible but the room had not been cleaned correctly,1
1475,first of all the pictures of the rooms must be from when it was a non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke,1
1476,i reserved a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking room,1
1477,the metal stairs leading up to the second floor which we had to pay for this,1
1478,the best thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
1479,if you are planning a trip to the batesville oxford area i would suggest that unless your life depended on it don't stay here,1
1480,had a reservation for this hotel but when i got to the room it would smell like smoke again,1
1481,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of maintenance,1
1482,it's is dirty it smells like cigarette when it was a non-smoking room we entered,1
1483,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
1484,one of the downstairs doors to get in the hotel doesn't have many stores or food places nearby,1
1485,they tried to put us in a basement room when the majority of the hotel was filthy and unclean,1
1486,went on a long motorcycle ride and just wanted to find a place to lay your head with no cares this could be it,1
1487,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
1488,the room was dirty there was a hole in the wall place,1
1489,the room was impossible for a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
1490,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the couch looks like something they,1
1491,we live out of town and we stayed at this hotel in may 2015 with mom and my 2 month old daughter,1
1492,the outside door wouldn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of nowhere,1
1493,there was some stuff on top of one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
1494,bathroom in the room was enough to make me want to stay there again,1
1495,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone with who i guessed to be a displeased customer,1
1496,they again said they would not refund my money and that it is not that far from there,1
1497,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
1498,i'll cut management a bit of a disappointment and literally,1
1499,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very rude as well,1
1500,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
1501,when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
1502,very upset to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad neighborhood,1
1503,we asked where to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
1504,the room had mold on the walls in the hallways,1
1505,i booked through hotels but when we got their they told us they had to leave,1
1506,if i wasn't so tired would leave,1
1507,there is no security the staff is extremely rude and not well trained,1
1508,so i would stay some where else at the last minute during week of the masters,1
1509,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk was obviously there just doing her job,1
1510,the stay was awful staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
1511,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
1512,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and musty smelling,1
1513,t-v controls did not work properly room was dusty,1
1514,i checked in requesting a non smoking room and it smelled like someone was smoking before i got in there,1
1515,there were also ants crawling on the desk and i was on the property for 10 minutes max,1
1516,would not stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back afterwards,1
1517,casino was fine but i will never go back and stay there,1
1518,at check in the clerk asked if i wanted to book the laquinta inn i would have,1
1519,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
1520,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for a long weekend from march 6 thru 8,1
1521,when i called down to the front desk to ask for a wash cloth,1
1522,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
1523,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
1524,the extra fee for a double room had been paid but the manager refused to talk to us even after two calls,1
1525,we talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
1526,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
1527,no towels in room we had to go get a drink with him,1
1528,the room was very hot and even though we had just walked from there and took pictures,1
1529,the person at the front desk were good,1
1530,we walk into our room and i knew this,1
1531,we were so tired on top of that i could not get a receipt because it was prepaid,1
1532,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
1533,no one there locally can help no one at the desk when i tried to check-in,1
1534,the hotel reservation said it was a non-smoking room during his extended stay,1
1535,we proceeded to go to the bathroom with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there,1
1536,the bathroom hadn't been cleaned at all,1
1537,when we first walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall,1
1538,the furniture in the room was not smoke free,1
1539,we went to desk and the staff was friendly and the price was right for the area,1
1540,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue,1
1541,they could not find my reservation then when i got to my room where the ac was off and had been for weeks,1
1542,it was the worst hotel stay i have ever had at a hotel,1
1543,obviously picked this place because it was cheap but wish i would have kept on looking for another hotel,1
1544,we checked in to find out the hotel was under remodel and the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
1545,we never got to stay at the suburban extended stay,1
1546,also i left a pair of sweat pants in my room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
1547,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the building and my room was switched twice,1
1548,our room had a bad odor and the air conditioning didn't work and bed sheets had stains,1
1549,once there was told it was not available in the room i checked with the front,1
1550,the best part of this stay was the room was clean with the exception of one dirty towel in the bathroom,1
1551,the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
1552,there was a air purifier in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get our refund,1
1553,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
1554,i wont stay there again i see why it was not full,1
1555,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find a room in an area with none,1
1556,we were going to try to find somewhere else to stay and save yourself the irritation and frustration,1
1557,i went and it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a great overall trip,1
1558,i was not impressed with the hotel either,1
1559,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
1560,we stayed for 2 nights and left a day early from marathon due to this facility,1
1561,of all the hotels i have stayed in the car but it was too late for us to find another hotel we would have,1
1562,i wish i could get my money back because of the no refund thing,1
1563,pool closed hole in the wall no lock on the bathroom door had hand prints all over it,1
1564,i would not recomend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
1565,desk clerk said she did not know what they were made of plastic,1
1566,i was forced to take late at night after a long drive from florida without a reservation,1
1567,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and had hair on them,1
1568,the holiday inn front desk told me there was nothing they could do because they don't know it's gone,1
1569,not completely horrible but the room had not been cleaned either,1
1570,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
1571,of course that didn't change the fact that the only way to describe our experience of staying at hotel narcis is bleak,1
1572,while attempting to check out of a hotel,1
1573,the staff refused to give me the corporate information she gave me a key to a room,1
1574,at first the desk clerk said that housekeeping was gone for the day but lo behold no bath towels,1
1575,we didnt want to chance anything getting thing broken we were told that it would be a decent place to sleep,1
1576,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
1577,the tv didn't have a place to stay for the family but it turned out to be a mistake,1
1578,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't even get someone to seat us for a table at dinner,1
1579,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
1580,we stayed in this was the most horrible experience i have never experienced anything like this before,1
1581,the hotel had no room service menu in the room and not the same color of original paint,1
1582,the back of the door looked like it was kicked in the room had an awful smell to it,1
1583,a blowtorch would be a good place to leave your dog i guess,1
1584,the entire place reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on the sheets and pillowcases,1
1585,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
1586,this is our first time staying at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
1587,there was an instant odor as soon as you stepped off the elevator you gagged,1
1588,then they didn't want to be there,1
1589,00 i told them i didn't feel safe in the hotel room as well as in the shower,1
1590,they said that there was a 250 charge on my credit card even though room was paid for hotel released it upon complaint,1
1591,after one night in the room and literally walked back out,1
1592,plus when we arrived their internet was down so there was no one manning the front desk after 12 minutes they finally came up,1
1593,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms both nightmares,1
1594,my girlfriend and i had a late flight and got to the hotel it was 1 star i got charged a lot,1
1595,the room was terrible and it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
1596,the manager was very unprofessional and did not want to be charged for another night since we were canceling our reservation,1
1597,the staff was awesome but when i checked the room it was musty and humid,1
1598,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the smell was so strong we kept the window open for fresh air,1
1599,everything we asked for they didnt have the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
1600,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
1601,it didn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
1602,so heres some advice look for another hotel and stay far away from this hotel if you plan on checking in early,1
1603,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
1604,i booked this hotel about three weeks in advance and the motel still couldn't get anything right,1
1605,it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a great view of santana row,1
1606,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
1607,i asked 2 times towels and heck the ac is not working they never came to fix it which they assured me that they would,1
1608,we walk into our room and i knew this,1
1609,the key didn't work most of the time so if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
1610,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
1611,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed that looked like it had not been used in many years and like smoke,1
1612,we were so tired on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
1613,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned around and left,1
1614,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
1615,within five minutes of checking in to the hotel room was 85 degrees and very musty,1
1616,the bathroom was fairly clean this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
1617,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and they told me of course housekeeping didn't find anything so,1
1618,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
1619,hotel states it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
1620,i had to ask for clean sheets,1
1621,this is the worst hotel i stayed at,1
1622,needed a room for his class reunion so i booked this at the last minute due to 48 inches of snow,1
1623,even before going to bed i canceled the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
1624,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
1625,the lady said they had been asking the owners for a couple of hours in the room we saw a live roach crawling toward us,1
1626,the reservation was wrong and i had to put a 5,1
1627,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the hotel is nice but regret set in when entered my floor,1
1628,the topper the bed linens had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
1629,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
1630,their lounge barleycorn's didn't have a remote control old furniture,1
1631,i asked the front desk if i could cancel and get a refund and he hung up on us,1
1632,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
1633,i would never stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the port clinton area,1
1634,i had to go downstairs to the front desk to find out,1
1635,we will never stay at this hotel the place is run down old furniture not a very clean place,1
1636,the bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower was dirty enough to cause me to skip it,1
1637,will not ever be coming back to this place and it shouldn't be considered a non-smoking room,1
1638,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible after breakfast,1
1639,there was some stuff on top of one of the beds were used and dirty had not been replaced,1
1640,let me just say i will never book with comfort suites in the future,1
1641,this resort claimed to be a ski-in ski-out which was important to me,1
1642,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to share a bed which i was poorly compensated for,1
1643,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
1644,no towels in room we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
1645,the tv did not want to work and the bed was very comfortable but that's all i heard from them,1
1646,it was the most unequivocally disgusting place i have ever walked into in my life,1
1647,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1
1648,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
1649,then he put me on hold and came back to the room and closed it again,1
1650,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room and the front window was open,1
1651,so bad i didnt even stay at and had to pay again still no call to complain to hotels,1
1652,first of all the front desk had a hard time getting it back,1
1653,this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad part of town fitness center is a bad joke,1
1654,unless i am desperate for a hotel room in this area i will never stay here again and will not recommend,1
1655,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel stay i have ever experienced,1
1656,we requested a non smoking room and i was told he couldn't do anything about it,1
1657,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
1658,i was given a room key when i checked the bed in the new room,1
1659,there was construction being done on the outside of the hotel was a workzone,1
1660,i was not aware when i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to stay here,1
1661,when we went in the room was enough to make me want to stay there again,1
1662,do not ever stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
1663,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a huge waste of our money,1
1664,it was by far the worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
1665,and the carpet has cigarettes burn even though we were in a construction zone walls were unfinished taping everywhere floors undone,1
1666,first night our employee went to working and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
1667,the air conditioner didn't work and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
1668,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
1669,woke up with bites all over him he thought it might have been the swat team there is a bit of a disappointment and literally,1

1671,there was no towels in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
1672,the first room tv did not work and i had to check out without taking shower,1
1673,the continental breakfast was a joke stale food,1
1674,they all got robbed the first night there we noticed there were fleas in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
1675,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
1676,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
1677,oh and did i mention housekeeping yells up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads,1
1678,being tired after a long trip the room smelled terrible it smelled like animal urine,1
1679,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager he made acusations that the beer cans were mine,1
1680,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
1681,i requested a rollaway which was also advertised to be available and was told it would be fixed within the hour,1
1682,when i called the front desk the next morning was the one positive of this stay,1
1683,he told us to go to the lobby without her,1
1684,this wsax the worst motel i have stayed in for years,1
1685,i was told they only have the small room with 2 double beds at this location using the hotel chains website lq,1
1686,the hotel is in a bad neighborhood,1
1687,my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1
1688,it was the cops being there all night trying to get rid of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
1689,not kept up as well and lots of bugs in the heater in the nude and play helicopter,1
1690,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
1691,granted it is 4:30am in the morning but when i called the hotel they were thin and with holes in them,1

1693,white sheets had yellow stains and hair on them and the shower didn't work reported it but they never fixed it,1
1694,i do not recommend this hotel at all it was close to glacier and had a family suite available,1

1696,i was disappointed in our room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room all through the night,1
1697,we were there for the whole weekend and i asked for extra towels they would only give us half of our money back,1
1698,the man at front desk was very unprofessional and did not want to be disturbed,1
1699,first of all i usually like red roof because they have a great king street location but that is all,1
1700,the clerk at the front desk and told them what was going on in room above us,1
1701,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work most of the time,1
1702,had dinner one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
1703,finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and then all over the bed and no towels or soap,1
1704,outside in the parking lot directly in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby arguing with an attendant,1
1705,second when we returned to the hotel room was 85 degrees and very musty,1
1706,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
1707,had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed we would have been charged for the same day cancellation,1
1708,crickets all over the place don't stay here even if it's free,1

1713,our friends we were traveling with a group of senior citizens,1
1714,all my things were gone from the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
1715,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is a bad form of advertisement,1
1716,it's sad because the front desk staff was friendly and the price was right and the room was not what was pictured on line,1
1717,it was awful and i will never stay at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
1718,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
1719,the manager argued with me regarding the claim of smoking in the room they charge you a lot of money if you come early,1

1729,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
1730,the front desk area is an absolute mess and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1

1737,i booked one room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
1738,screen door fell off our patio door located basically in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1

1761,no security at the hotel as all of the doors from the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1

1763,i was told to go to a presentation on wyndham properties,1
1764,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a coffee maker neither did they have a iron and ironing board,1

1783,they are in the middle of the night,1
1784,i was told we would get it back the day we checked out and went to another hotel,1
1785,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
1786,the only clean thing about this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed had no sheets,1
1787,when i gave the ticket to the taxi driver he told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available,1
1788,didn't get the room i had paid for it on expedia,1
1789,the hotel smelled it wasn't clean i could stop by,1
1790,subsequently i learned there was a denny's within walking distance,1
1791,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
1792,i strongly sugges that you do not stay here on your vacation,1
1793,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
1794,i felt that should have been a much nicer hotel,1
1795,we left for the day and we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else instead,1
1796,first room was reeking of smoke i specified a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
1797,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
1798,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
1799,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff said we were unable to check out conditions,1
1800,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel for business of pleasure,1
1801,paid 100 and then changed our mind after seeing the room was i was tired and exhausted and just wanted a shower and a bed,1
1802,the first hiccup in this stay was the room was clean the,1
1803,first off we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
1804,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
1805,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
1806,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
1807,we asked for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
1808,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1

1964,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the desk said he could not guarantee an early check in,1
1965,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the fourth of july weekend otherwise i would have left,1
1966,the door to the room and when i went to check out the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
1967,it is not very secure people come in and out of and used the stairs as to avoid lobby and elevator,1
1968,we went and asked to be switched to another room and they said sorry were sold out,1
1969,we didn't feel safe at all during my stay,1
1970,room service is bad the maid knocked on my door at 10:45 and yelling at me that it was under constriction,1
1971,when asked to speak to a manager she said he was not available until afternoon i repeat never again,1
1972,finding bedbugs crawling all over the pillows and then all over the bed and no towels or toilet paper,1

1978,the room we were assigned had a horrible smell to it and the door was not a tight fit,1
1979,was told no other rooms were available and didn't try moving to another room like i would trust the hotel anymore,1
1980,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever stayed at,1
1981,there are way better places to stay for the family but it turned out to be,1
1982,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
1983,we did not stay at this location again,1
1984,the room had a roll in shower and the room wasn't too clean so only after a couple of hours,1

1986,this was the worst place i have ever been,1
1987,my husband spoke with the manager and she seemed to have no care,1
1988,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is very unprofessional here please don't waste your money on this one,1
1989,so many things were wrong here i don't even want to complain because i don't think i will ever satay there again,1
1990,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1

1993,the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
1994,there were two other couples in our group that stayed at this hotel and found a dirty pair of men's underwear in the room,1
1995,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1

2003,i bring a small travel fan and don't have a king size bed with no blankets,1
2004,outdated and pretty much with the price we paid the hotel itself was disappointing,1
2005,5 hours from portland oregon to miles city we were very tired so didn't push for a refund etc,1
2006,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care or was concerned,1

2012,the front office staff was great but the cleaning crew was horrible,1
2013,the airport shuttle which was one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
2014,the night manager was very nice but we will never ever stay at that hotel again,1
2015,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
2016,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel,1
2017,i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a place to stay for the family but it turned out to be,1
2018,i'll cut management a bit of a disappointment and literally,1
2019,no towels in room we had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
2020,i decided to stay at this hotel again,1
2021,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
2022,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
2023,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1

2028,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
2029,we arrived at 2 and check-in was a bit slow not horrible,1
2030,the only thing i use this hotel is the nastiest grossest place,1
2031,there we no trash cans in the room but it was working,1
2032,the funky sour old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
2033,we checked in got into our room and everything is dirty,1
2034,the hairdryer was barely on the wall and a big hole in the bathroom wall by the tub that kept the bathroom floor wet,1
2035,no hot water manager acted like he didn't care about the situation he told us to go to the lobby without her,1
2036,we will pitch a tent on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
2037,my husband spoke with the manager who did nothing,1
2038,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i stayed at the la quinta and discovery inn got to keep my money,1
2039,they again said they would not refund my money and that it is not his fault,1
2040,staff stole 4 000 out of our room on ground floor,1
2041,this was very clean but other than that it needs a major face lift,1
2042,we left and will never stay their agin,1
2043,it was late i need a place to crash late at night,1
2044,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on my experience,1
2045,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
2046,when we walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall,1
2047,we switched rooms in the morning and he didn't know what he was doing,1
2048,there were bus all over the bathroom the toilet looked like it had mold on it from a leak from the bathroom above us,1
2049,but the room had not been cleaned out,1
2050,sheets were still damp and the smell was covered up by the comforter,1
2051,i didn't want to be moved to a different room on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
2052,the manager of the hotel was a workzone,1
2053,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
2054,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
2055,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
2056,it was the worst experience i have had with a hotel,1
2057,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
2058,enough said do not book this hotel friends of ours did,1
2059,1 when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
2060,the hallway on the second floor and as soon as we entered the office we should have turned around and left,1
2061,i do not recommend this motel to anyone,1
2062,here's my impression of the place based on a one night stay to drive to atlanta the next day,1
2063,this hotel is quite run down and in desperate need of updates and remodel,1
2064,it was so bad that there was no one one at the front desk was very argumentative and rude,1
2065,the two people working the front desk on our first night,1
2066,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
2067,way over priced for such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
2068,they wouldn't give us a different room but the hotel was the pits,1
2069,i will not stay at this location again,1
2070,the lobby area was great though but that's not enough of a reason for me to come back,1
2071,i called and told the man at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
2072,the room had damage to it when we got there wife and kids ages 3,1
2073,i would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
2074,the other comforter had seamen stains all over it and towels were stacked on the controls to flush the toilet,1
2075,the front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for,1
2076,to my utter disgust the room was dirty when we checked in,1
2077,the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
2078,hotel sits in the middle of the night,1
2079,i was afraid to walk on the bathroom floor in our previous room,1
2080,room had a bad smell to it and the door was not locked,1
2081,after a twelve hour drive from georgia my husband i were very tired and pulled into the hotel parking lot,1
2082,this was by far one of the worst places i've ever staid at,1
2083,i told the supervisor in duty and he said he would find one and get back to me the same day,1
2084,not only was it dirty but the smell was not coming from the bathroom,1
2085,the biggest issue i have is that they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
2086,after we finally got the keys they tried to put us in a room above the check in area,1
2087,i arrived late looking for a last minute one night stay,1
2088,probably won't stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
2089,the bathroom ceiling above the shower looked as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
2090,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
2091,it was soooooo filthy and the smell was so bad i didn't stay,1
2092,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
2093,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
2094,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
2095,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
2096,the room my mother and i stayed in the room july 27 2016,1
2097,so due to the smell water and lack of security this is one of the better off property hotels ive stayed at,1
2098,the first room smelled like cat urin plained twice and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
2099,i was very disappointed for the cost of this room for one night and it was just horrible nightmare,1
2100,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
2101,as it stood for me i had to get them to close the pool finally at 11 pm,1
2102,we checked in around 6:00pm and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
2103,the carpet had spots that my socks stuck to because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,1
2104,pretty much the worst place i have ever been in,1
2105,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1
2106,00 when i checked in i was given a much lower price when,1
2107,i did inquire if the room was grimy and reeked,1
2108,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the tub had a brownish grey appearance supposed to be white,1
2109,arrived late with young child to find out the hotel was under remodel and the room next to me,1
2110,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
2111,the front desk lied to us when we checked in and pretty much went to sleep,1
2112,it didn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
2113,the last straw was that the room had a small table with two chairs,1
2114,we left and will never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel was incredibly brief,1
2115,the rooms didn't look anything like what was advertised on the check in counter a punjent smell grabbed me by the face,1
2116,we tried to close the curtains but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
2117,booked king room with handicap assessability for my parents and they ended up with a smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
2118,when we asked for help and the front desk said there was nothing wrong with the card,1
2119,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting motel i have ever,1
2120,the hotel is being renovated and i was in a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
2121,we proceeded to go to the front desk for issues the girl working the front desk on our first night rude rude and rude,1
2122,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
2123,then had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
2124,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
2125,i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
2126,my room despite being told it was a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room,1
2127,there was black mold on the shower curtain rod,1
2128,the last straw was that the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it waddle security or what but it made us all uncomfortable,1
2129,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water,1
2130,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the hotel could use some updating,1
2131,we didn't feel safe at all during my stay,1
2132,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a cockroach in one,1
2133,the front desk didn't have a double bed which wasn't a huge deal but they don't tell you that,1
2134,we went and asked to be let in,1
2135,it took the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
2136,the front desk girl was very nice but we will never go back,1
2137,we arrived and were told our room was not even swept or vacuumed,1
2138,air conditioner didn't work and the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the showers,1
2139,we checked in late at night and leave in the morning because the guy at counter was flirting with a guest,1
2140,i was informed by the front desk clerk was extremely rude,1
2141,she then asked if i wanted to go get a air freshener,1
2142,second time staying at this hotel every again,1
2143,i'm asking for my money back and he told me fine just leave,1
2144,will not ever be coming back to this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
2145,however the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even stay i went and booked another hotel down the street,1
2146,yes i know that there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were 5 children,1
2147,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
2148,first room the cable didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
2149,i was traveling with my grandchildren so i choose this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
2150,this is by far the worse i've ever seen,1
2151,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
2152,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
2153,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
2154,the sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and so was the bed,1
2155,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
2156,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
2157,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
2158,a couple days later i received a call from the hotel front desk said to deal with it,1
2159,so the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it,1
2160,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation made through the website,1
2161,the condition of one the beds was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
2162,i wouldnt stay there again i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
2163,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
2164,i was so sick the next morning i checked out and asked for a refund if it wasn't to late,1
2165,so many things were wrong here i don't even want to sit on it,1
2166,m even i had a do not disturb sign to find that the cleaning,1
2167,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
2168,hotel was fine for the price and for a 1 night stop-over each way during spring vacation,1
2169,she wanted to have a hotel camp out with the family and it was not a clean surface in the room,1
2170,on the first day refrigerator was not working and looked like someone was partying in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
2171,99 price they have posted on the highway and reasonably priced which were our main points for selection,1
2172,i drove them to this place and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
2173,i stayed on the fifth floor in what was supposed to be smoke free and they reeked of cigarettes,1
2174,this was by far one of the worst hotels i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
2175,when i try to get my money back but i know there's no hope of that,1
2176,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
2177,not really in a good neighborhood didn't feel safe for myself or my automobile,1
2178,when we finally got to our room there was a terrible smell,1
2179,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
2180,she said to call the manager in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
2181,then we get to the room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
2182,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
2183,later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt on the sheets on one of the beds,1
2184,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
2185,the room was clean even though we had a non smoking room,1
2186,we cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
2187,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the worst stay in a motel that i have ever stayed at,1
2188,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was by far the worst experience,1
2189,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel,1
2190,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
2191,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
2192,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
2193,the entire facility is extremely run down and in need of drastic upgrading,1
2194,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
2195,needless to say we will never ever stay at that hotel,1
2196,the topper the bed linens had not been changed from a prior guest,1
2197,the teenager at the front desk we were directed to drive around to the back of the door and bathroom door,1
2198,we got there didn't look like the online photos at all,1
2199,when i arrived i was greeted by two homeless men sitting in the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
2200,no hot water manager acted like he didn't care about price at this point,1
2201,when i returned to my room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
2202,the carpets were dirty both in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
2203,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
2204,horrid the tv didn't have a working ac,1
2205,i think they just wanted all guests on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
2206,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
2207,and when i mentioned we had no tv remote control in the room was pick up the alarm clock why dont know,1
2208,they had to give me a receipt when i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
2209,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our daughter,1
2210,my new room was also dirty and there was a denny's within walking distance,1
2211,this was the first time that i booked a room through hotwire's hot rate the hotel was not very clean,1
2212,air conditioner didn't work and the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
2213,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
2214,then had to wait an hour for our room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible,1
2215,my boyfriend and i were in town for an extended period due to their job,1
2216,this hotel is in a bad neighborhood,1
2217,also a c looks like it's going to be uncomfortable in the room,1
2218,so by this time it was 1 am and we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would enjoy staying in,1
2219,we left as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
2220,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
2221,who runs a business like this when they found a room we were given but they wouldn't do it again,1
2222,went to the front desk to talk to,1
2223,the ceiling was stained and some of the interest was the location and the comfort inn brand,1
2224,they had no one available to look at it so they gave us a room whose bathroom door won't lock,1
2225,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and they gave our room to them,1
2226,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
2227,prior to checking in i called the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it,1
2228,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
2229,she was not welcoming nor helpful when we asked for more they said they did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
2230,the shower head constantly leaks all over the bathroom like it had not been cleaned,1
2231,it took me 3 hours to get someone to come down,1
2232,the dog cried for almost two hours before the owner came back to the room they were back in full effect,1
2233,well when we got there we had to call the front desk to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves,1
2234,this has to be the worst hotel i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one was the worst,1
2235,subsequently i learned there was a denny's within walking distance,1
2236,will not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
2237,we had no wash clothes in our room and bathroom and comfortable bed and don't require much more than that,1
2238,the young man at the desk found the confirmation and said it was because i was smoking in the room,1
2239,that problem was cordially taken care of at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
2240,budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and be sure to try the new pancake maker,1
2241,we received our requested room number it was clean and there was a stuffed animal from a previous guest,1
2242,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
2243,the 3rd room had another smell we also discovered several bugs in the room very much so we lived with it,1
2244,yes i get that there was a 45 minute wait,1
2245,we called the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,1
2246,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
2247,the walls are paper thin and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
2248,there were signs of disrepair in the hotel room and was completed and utterly disgusted,1
2249,we did not sleep more than a couple of hours we found a bedbug,1
2250,i would not recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer,1
2251,check in was fine but when i got there and nobody cared to actually clean it up,1
2252,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
2253,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
2254,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
2255,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was never cleaned in the 10 days i stayed there,1
2256,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
2257,we had our family reunion there and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
2258,years ago we had stayed at a hampton the previous night and it was worth half that,1
2259,the mini-fridge was on the floor after the beds were made,1
2260,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
2261,decided to not stay even though they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
2262,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the door looked like it had mold growing,1
2263,the room stunk had to go get a drink with him,1
2264,when i called down to the front desk as i was in a rush and i didn't even want to mention the breakfast,1
2265,i checked in requesting a non smoking room but the entire first floor was under construction,1
2266,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was not clean and the lobby has a terrible odor,1
2267,the management told me that there was no one at the desk when i tried to get a refund,1
2268,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
2269,my family and i have stayed in the was the worst,1
2270,we came back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
2271,so after i woke up i found there were no towels and when,1
2272,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
2273,this was the worst hotel i've stayed in better in third world countries,1
2274,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it waddle security or what but it made us all uncomfortable,1
2275,she has no ability or desire to resolve issues and the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
2276,she then asked if i wanted to inspect my room because she would not be able to sleep for the noise,1
2277,i was so sick the next morning i had already fallen asleep,1
2278,non of the rooms match what was advertised on the check in counter a punjent smell grabbed me by the face,1
2279,we didn't even stay we had to go to the lobby without her,1
2280,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to know where to put us,1
2281,the room had a bad odor and the air conditioning didn't work in the shower,1
2282,so now we are in the process of closing the front office,1
2283,we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
2284,the carpets are dirty our couch had a hole in it there was no toilet seat on the toilet,1
2285,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1

2287,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and i didnt get a refund,1
2288,she did not offer any kind of explanation just told me it was bed bugs and prescribed medicine for the itching,1
2289,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
2290,apon checking into my room i had to keep the window open for fresh air,1
2291,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
2292,terrible first off some one came into my room while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
2293,no security at the hotel as all of the doors from the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1
2294,of driving all i was looking for a cheap hotel just for the night and turned down the bed they were between the sheets,1
2295,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
2296,last time my family dragged me there i had to stand in line for a 1 2 hour to check in,1
2297,it was awful and i would never stay there again,1
2298,before we put our things in the room i paid for i felt she was very unprofessional,1
2299,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1
2300,first off when we got there and the hotel was sold out,1
2301,i called back one more time and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
2302,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and it was impossible to change to non smoking,1
2303,i will never stay there again and can not recommend it,1
2304,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
2305,i checked in requesting a non smoking room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
2306,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to check out of this hotel,1
2307,i went back to the room and they don't make hotel to be aware of it too,1
2308,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
2309,the plumbing was so bad that we couldn't even feel comfortable taking a shower,1
2310,the young man at the front desk because the room had none and we had to switch hotels,1
2311,they need to find a new hotel at 11 pm after a long day of traveling and meetings,1
2312,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very nice we will never stay here again and will not recommend,1
2313,when we opened the door and we didn't have the package and the front desk guy is rude,1
2314,so for two nights we had no tv remote in the room the door's bolt is ripped off the wall,1
2315,room was filthy had bugs crawling up the wall another fell on the floor,1
2316,i should have known the rooms would have been disgusting by the smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins,1
2317,internet was very slow and most of the time and can honstly say i've never stayed ina more depressing facility,1
2318,i reserved for 6 nights because i was on the property for 10 minutes max,1
2319,had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed we would have been better off just sleeping in my truck or in a tent,1
2320,unfortunately this was the only place accepting pets and we didn't see her wash her hands,1
2321,tv remote in fitness room didn't work so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
2322,m even i had a do not disturb sign to find that the cleaning,1
2323,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was decent,1
2324,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
2325,if you ever go to the front desk as i was in a newly renovated room,1
2326,the extra fee for a double room had been paid but the manager refused to talk to us even after two calls,1
2327,the first room i checked into had a bad smell was dark with only a tiny window cigarette burn in bed,1
2328,there were splatter stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in the lobby,1
2329,we were up for a family reunion i will never ever stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
2330,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
2331,i have booked many hotels and never had a problem this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
2332,shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
2333,i was hoping for a romantic night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
2334,we picked this out over the internet and some of the channels didn't even come in,1
2335,my husband and i stayed here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion,1
2336,when i called the front desk the next morning was the one positive of this stay,1
2337,my room was not ready when we arrived and we were scared,1
2338,they told me the hotel was not full,1

2342,when we learned the tv didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
2343,the bathroom had a hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1
2344,in recent years my wife and i have stayed at kimpton hotels often and this is the only positive,1
2345,i was told it was available and that i did not have choice but stay over 2 nights,1
2346,the old saying you get what you pay for and it was not on the website when i booked i put i needed a crib,1
2347,got the feeling that they were aware of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
2348,first off we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
2349,i'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't be considered a non-smoking,1
2350,the ad online stated it was next to the unit was literally shacking,1
2351,staff was nice but the room was not what was booked and confirmed but we had no other option since we brought our dogs,1
2352,we only stayed one night and switched hotels,1
2353,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back and find my second room,1
2354,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and leave the hotel at night 12:00 am,1
2355,there was old body fluids on the floor at the end of our vacation we wanted to pay with cash rather than cards,1
2356,i will never stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't know any hotel only had showers in rooms,1
2357,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
2358,the only thing good about this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever had,1

2367,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty,1
2368,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so bad it couldn't be that bad,1
2369,if your looking for a place to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness,1
2370,we checked in to find out the hotel was under construction with planks to walk on over the second floor,1
2371,the mattress was on top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs badly,1
2372,the entire experience was bad and we would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone,1
2373,i left crying and i will never recommend this dirty and uncomfortable hotel,1
2374,the room reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and tattered,1
2375,i called customer service from the parking lot and obviously strung out,1
2376,when we walked in the staff was very nice and very helpful and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
2377,i will never never go back to the front desk,1
2378,i called them they attempted to call the manager in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
2379,the first room tv did not work the shower head was literally so low on the wall,1
2380,we took our shoes off and the floors in the bathroom were dirty and definitely appeared like they were not cleaned,1
2381,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
2382,we cancelled as soon as we checked in we were rented a dirty occupied room,1
2383,changed our plans and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
2384,i would not recommend this hotel at all the worst experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
2385,as a reply to this note i was told that there was no one else in the lobby,1
2386,room 1013 lighting issues broken lamp tv did not function properly in fact the deadbolt did not work,1
2387,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1

2389,i took pics of roaches blood on the wall and when i went to take a shower and there was no attempt to fix it,1
2390,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
2391,he finally came to his senses and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed,1
2392,the room smelled the air didn't work and the elevator sounded like a popping soda can when you stepped inside,1
2393,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
2394,when i woke up i had to call hotels to dispute the charges,1
2395,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
2396,this is the worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel,1
2397,the bathroom sink was to turn it on with the knob u had to turn it on manually,1
2398,one common bathroom for the whole floor on the 2nd floor and about the size of a queen size bed,1

2401,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a blood stain,1
2402,the first hiccup in this stay was the room was clean but tired,1
2403,there were strands of hair all over the bathroom even trails of ants in the sink area,1
2404,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and they will replace them,1
2405,when we called front desk to mention this,1
2406,we did not stay there because i was on the third floor was uneven and hard to walk on while drunk,1
2407,the lady said they had been asking the owners for a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
2408,we walk into our room and i knew this,1
2409,our room smelled musty from the moment we opened the door to the steps and side door bangs loudly,1
2410,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and usually they are older but not to bad,1
2411,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a flat screen tv,1
2412,went to call front desk ended with front desk not being able to hear neighbors and people in the hallway,1
2413,the safe in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
2414,as a travel agent owner of cruiseone erik fischer associates i would have to call motel manager nikki on monday to get a refund,1
2415,the smell was so strong we kept the window open for fresh air,1
2416,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the toilet the seat fell off,1
2417,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst casino hotel room i have ever stayed in,1
2418,the lady at the front desk and spoke to the front desk,1
2419,but the room had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm had to ask for clean sheets,1
2420,the bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be completely remodeled or closed down,1
2421,we still had to pay for the full time and i said it was a great hotel,1
2422,all 5 of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price and this was the dirtiest hampton inn i have ever seen,1
2423,questioned him about how many people were in the same boat as we were,1
2424,electrical outlet hanging out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
2425,needless to say i cancelled the second night and went to stay at another hotel down the street,1
2426,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the smell was covered up by air freshener,1
2427,the rude lady would not give me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
2428,we walked into our room and i knew this,1
2429,overall the place was a dump and i would never let my worst enemy spend the night in that hellhole,1
2430,called corporate and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
2431,the smell in the room was not touched,1
2432,i'm appalled by this place and it was a great overall trip,1
2433,my band mates and i drove 20 hours straight walk into the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was simply horrible,1
2434,swimming pool was very cold so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
2435,i would highly recommend finding somewhere else to stay and save yourself the irritation and frustration,1
2436,the rugs are dirty and when we took a shower the towel ripped while he was drying himself off,1
2437,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel because it allowed pets,1
2438,the accommodation was bad along with the customer service and have us a run around,1
2439,our internet would not stay connected at all we tried and tried to get us to cancel with hotels and then pay them direct,1
2440,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
2441,they charged my card after i made the reservation when i was told it was not available in the room i didn't,1
2442,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even up to a 2 star,1
2443,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
2444,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
2445,took a long time before we found out it was the heater and told them,1
2446,the reservation was wrong and i had to put it back together,1
2447,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in,1
2448,i would not stay here if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
2449,i called to the front desk and canceled,1
2450,we thought that the room was used before,1
2451,would not stay at this hotel the same nights,1
2452,third room honestly wanted to sleep in my car before i'd spend the night here again,1
2453,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
2454,there was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
2455,this is the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
2456,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
2457,we moved to a red roof inn and had a much more comfortable and felt much more safe than i did at this hotel,1
2458,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
2459,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
2460,i heard the lady on our floor cussing because she had to redo the paperwork and send me to another room,1
2461,the computer in the business center was so old it was hardened in the little containers,1
2462,i can live with outdated interior but i am not sure they know what a vacuum is,1
2463,i called in advance to request an early check in but he would make note of the request quite understandable,1
2464,when i checked in i was told there would be 2 queens sized beds but they were clearly full size instead,1
2465,our internet would not stay connected at all we tried and tried to get us to cancel with hotels and then pay them direct,1
2466,they said they have no other room and when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the lobby,1
2467,first of all the man at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
2468,in addition numerous unaccompanied children played in the halls all hours of the day and night pretty sure it involved drugs,1
2469,when i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
2470,the front desk didn't have a place to stay for the family but it turned out to be an 80,1
2471,last time my family dragged me there i had to stand there and wait by tha,1
2472,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
2473,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i have ever been in,1
2474,the second night i was there the i'm guessing local kids throw are so disruptive,1
2475,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
2476,the front desk charged me 250 dollars and said it was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
2477,i'm not the type to complain but kindly asked the front desk for anything you will be standing there for over 15 minutes,1
2478,the furniture in the room was not clean,1
2479,so by this time it was 1 am and we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would enjoy staying in,1
2480,from the beginning i knew that this wasn't going to be a problem but the registration was nonrefundable,1
2481,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
2482,miserable experience and we will never go back,1
2483,room was not vacuumed curtain hanging down the bathroom was not working they never came to fix it they just removed it,1
2484,the hotel itself wasn't too terrible but the service was so terrible we walked out,1
2485,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
2486,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the only one that did not lock,1
2487,within five minutes of checking in to the room i understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray,1
2488,the room we were given a tiny room,1
2489,we decided to cut our stay short and when i went to check out they refused to give me one,1
2490,if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
2491,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk and they did send a repair man right over,1
2492,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
2493,this hotel should not be on expedia list,1
2494,three days later and i still don't know what they were made of plastic,1
2495,so the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it,1
2496,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so security was a joke,1
2497,crossing the border from canada we were given a couple cards neither of which opened the door,1
2498,the rooms were comfortable but did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
2499,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
2500,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
2501,the key didn't work most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
2502,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
2503,hotel would not even return money for first night even though i was told by a worker that the reason wifi doesn't work,1
2504,no one there locally can help no one at the desk when i tried to get out it broke again,1
2505,there was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the door where you could see outside through our door and our ac unit,1
2506,leaks all over the bathroom bugs everywhere the pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep,1
2507,i asked to talk to a supervisor was told that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed,1
2508,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
2509,i was tired and ready to go to bed at 10 30 pm but the music next door,1
2510,someone in the front desk did not seem to care that i was unhappy,1
2511,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
2512,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
2513,as we began to swim the bottom of the door was not sealed and the sunlight came in long with the heat,1
2514,he checked the room to make sure it doesn't happen,1
2515,it wasn't made and the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
2516,the cleanliness was lacking i lifted the toilet seat and there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed,1
2517,i could not even used it we had no tv remote in the room the numerous exposed nails in the upholstery cut his arm open,1
2518,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience the prior year,1
2519,all i was able to use it,1
2520,we checked in around 2p after we put our bags in the room we saw a live roach crawling toward us,1
2521,they didn't have any smoking rooms left but when i got to my room i had placed the pop down inside the doorway,1
2522,for slightly more money we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
2523,would not stay at this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
2524,i did not stay as i did not feel like i was in some drug invested crapy building,1
2525,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
2526,for starters the lady at the front desk always went out of their way to accomodate us,1
2527,i drove them to this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
2528,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude,1
2529,as soon as you opened the door to the stairs across from,1
2530,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
2531,when i talked to the front desk in case something happens to it,1
2532,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
2533,the hotel was under remodel and the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
2534,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to carry everything around with us,1
2535,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
2536,tired i decided to stay at this motel,1
2537,i booked a room through hotwire's hot rate the hotel was not clean do not stay here for any reason,1
2538,why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room bars of soap with someone else's hair on it,1
2539,when we arrived there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
2540,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through the facility with employee to find a clean room,1
2541,springs coming out of the faucet as it puddled in the tub it didn't drain and was just scuzzy,1
2542,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
2543,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
2544,but as i booked end prepaid through hotels dot com and why we would still be charged,1
2545,they said that was the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was clean,1
2546,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
2547,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were not very clean,1
2548,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
2549,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
2550,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
2551,window didnt open air conditioner did not run properly 5,1
2552,obviously the bathroom and the smell was terrible,1
2553,i took a shower and the whole room had a very musty smell because it was partly below the ground,1
2554,the manager of the hotel was filthy and unclean,1
2555,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
2556,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor where we were staying,1
2557,stay away ppl worst hotel i've stayed in better in third world countries,1
2558,overall we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation made through the website,1
2559,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
2560,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
2561,would have been nice to know that the hotel was completely full i think it was a convention of tattoo artists,1
2562,the staff was very friendly but the place was not my favorite,1
2563,very dated even though advertised as remodeled room looked clean but the smells in the carpet would not go away,1
2564,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute booking that we needed to extend a family trip,1
2565,other than location this hotel should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
2566,when i went to check out the room prior to the hotel staff who cared less when i addressed this,1
2567,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
2568,there were clumps of hair and candy wrappers just laying by the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
2569,since it was late we could not get another room until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
2570,was forced to stay because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
2571,the other comforter had seamen stains all over it and down in to the cushion,1
2572,when we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
2573,i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone plus on line we reserved for americas best value inn has poor service,1
2574,this was not on the website when i booked i put i needed a crib,1
2575,budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and be sure to try the new pancake maker,1
2576,all the reason we will not stay there again for complete lack of any amenities,1
2577,i booked through hotels that she couldn't do anything about it so the,1
2578,i will not stay at this motel,1
2579,to top it all off they didn't even have an ice machine,1
2580,i will never go back to the room they were back in full effect,1
2581,it was 20 degrees and the door to our room we were greeted by the smell of dank moldy carpet,1
2582,the inside lock on our room door was broken and would not shut all the way,1
2583,while the front desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
2584,the rooms were filthy and property was dirty and not sure i wanted to put my head on their pillow,1
2585,worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel they do not have 24 hour maintenance,1
2586,i called customer service from the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
2587,they said that was the only alternative unless i wanted to park in the parking lot i would never stay here again,1
2588,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go to in mobile al and my wife wanted to come with me,1
2589,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
2590,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was in very poor condition,1
2591,in the future i much rather sleep in my car before i'd spend the night here again,1
2592,the bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower was dirty enough to cause me to skip it,1
2593,didn't get the room i had paid for it on expedia,1
2594,when i returned to my room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
2595,they again said they would not refund my money and that it is not his fault,1
2596,we just needed a room for his class reunion so i booked this at the last minute during week of the masters,1
2597,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was to cover incidentals,1
2598,people living in an rv in the parking lot and yell at our group,1
2599,in all my travels it's the second worst place i have ever walked into in my life,1
2600,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and it seemed as if we were interrupting him,1
2601,i went back to the lady at the front desk 3 different guests walked up siting their keys didn't work,1
2602,this hotel was being remodled and should not have been rented out it should have been,1
2603,when we asked how that could happen we were at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
2604,we were so tired on top of that the door to the room was broken and did not shut properly,1
2605,so sad to have to pay for transportation and both hotels,1
2606,i informed her that there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
2607,reception was nice and that was the only good thing was the location very nice restaurants and shopping near by,1
2608,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute room at 1 am,1
2609,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
2610,if i wasn't so tired would leave,1
2611,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
2612,we checked in around 6:00pm and the room wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
2613,this was my first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
2614,when we arrived florida we were supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our daughter,1
2615,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean and asked that it get special attention that day to get cleaned,1
2616,got moved to the new room only to find out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
2617,one of the worst places i've ever stayed in ever,1
2618,i arrived to find out that the safe in our room did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
2619,was working out of town had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was much better but is now really run down,1
2620,was moved to another room unpacked and then realized shower didn't work and the refrigerator didn't work,1
2621,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
2622,prior to checking in i called the front desk and they did send a repair man right over,1
2623,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
2624,the rate was great but you get what you pay for doesn't work here you get less,1
2625,got to my room i had to call the staff to come take a look at one point,1
2626,motel 6 would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and a chevron across the parking lot from my room,1
2627,i have stayed at this hotel 3 nights,1
2628,this was supposed to be a non smoking room as i did not even want to take my shoes off,1
2629,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
2630,while attempting to check out of the room and they could not fix the problem,1
2631,only thing needed to say is we found bed bugs in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
2632,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
2633,the hotel was under remodel and the room next to us with both at a much cheaper rate,1
2634,the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a new set to put on the bed,1
2635,i would not stay here if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
2636,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
2637,another manager came in and told us that we had to ask for new towels and never got them,1
2638,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
2639,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work most of the time,1
2640,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was to cover incidentals,1
2641,note that my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back from the hotel,1
2642,the first response i got was i can't believe i had to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
2643,the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
2644,worst hotel i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
2645,i knew this was going to happen now,1
2646,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby,1
2647,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
2648,even considering never to stay in a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
2649,i have stayed here i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
2650,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites and would not return even if i was paid,1
2651,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
2652,the manager came in and told us that she couldnt find one we were told to go find a table,1
2653,why would i use hotels again when i can't even explains how horrible it was struggled to keep dinner down,1
2654,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
2655,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
2656,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
2657,we needed separate beds and the room we were given had a king and a sofa bed,1
2658,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
2659,i had requested a non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
2660,we had to get a bag of ice at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
2661,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
2662,we did not feel welcomed from the moment we opened the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
2663,one more think the parking lot is full of potholes,1
2664,i can live with outdated interior but i am not sure why in the morning it was all water,1
2665,the bed was comfortable but there was a huge stain next to the bed that looked like it had mold growing,1
2666,hotel said they could not attempt to refund me anything because i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
2667,the carpets were dirty and needed maintenance,1
2668,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites and would not return even if i was homeless,1
2669,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
2670,never stat at this hotel the place is run down old furniture not a very clean place,1
2671,no one there locally can help no one at the front desk was creepy,1
2672,not enough towels and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
2673,the room was impossible for a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of dog pet and had a very dirty musty feel,1
2674,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is now under new owners,1
2675,horrible experience hotel did nothing to fix this,1
2676,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room reeked of smoke,1
2677,we put a tip on the bed and all the room,1
2678,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
2679,that guest opened my room in the middle of the night there was a guest screaming in the hall from 2-3am,1
2680,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
2681,he finally gave us a non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
2682,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
2683,we went down early and found this room for one of my two rooms and had to go back to desk to get help,1
2684,i ended up here because there were no other rooms to switch to,1
2685,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke,1
2686,i told the supervisor in duty and he said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call,1
2687,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to check out of a hotel,1
2688,hotel states it's non-smoking but once i walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place,1
2689,cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
2690,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair on them,1
2691,the telephone in our room did not have a comforter or pillows on the bed and all the room,1
2692,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most unprofessional catering company i have ever dealt with,1
2693,the front desk charged me 250 dollars and said it was because i was given a room with dirty bathroom,1
2694,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
2695,our room reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms we were informed that they cancelled our reservation and had no rooms available,1
2696,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room,1
2697,02 17 2016 the staff of this hotel is very worn out and overpriced for economy price lodging,1
2698,also when i went to take a shower there was hair hanging from the shower and dried phlegm on the wall by the door casing,1
2699,when we came back it was still damp and the smell was so strong we kept the window open for fresh air,1
2700,the check in clerk stated that they were having an issue with the booking via travelocity,1
2701,six out of eight people were in the room and in the hallways until after 4 am,1

2709,i did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
2710,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
2711,this was not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again or any other quality inn,1
2712,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them,1
2713,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know because our room was not ready at check in time,1
2714,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
2715,the room was terrible and it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1

2717,i had to check out the following day,1

2725,only to find they didn't have to sleep in a ditch but that's not where i want to spend my time working,1
2726,i realized this when i booked the room through expedia i knew i had to stay 4 nights since my booking was non refundable,1
2727,i arrived at night and the door to the steps and side door bangs loudly,1
2728,i spoke with the manager who did nothing,1
2729,i would not recomend anyone to stay there for less than 30 minutes,1
2730,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
2731,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
2732,no hot water and discovered the power was out the day we left from 7:30 am to noon,1

2736,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
2737,i went and told the man that we,1

2742,the lobby had a funny smell and the room wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
2743,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and the room smelled like smoke,1
2744,on a ten day trip this was the second call i made concerning my stay,1
2745,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
2746,she went back downstairs and got a key to a different room to say the least maybe the worst hotel i've stayed in,1
2747,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
2748,our room was on the side opposite from the front desk that nothing could be done until the morning,1
2749,the condition of the hotel was a,1
2750,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
2751,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
2752,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
2753,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1

2755,there we no trash cans in the room but it was late and we were very tired,1
2756,my step daughter came up for the day and when we returned at night we found that the shower curtain was wrinkled and stained,1
2757,we complained and the man at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
2758,we ended up going to a different hotel across the street,1
2759,when i arrived at the hotel at 9:00 pm they were in the process of switching chains so one of our rooms was totally filthy,1
2760,the room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be biscuits and gravy,1
2761,i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1
2762,hotel was filthy and i ended up having to take one room,1
2763,the clerk kept swiping my card i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
2764,the location is out in the middle of the bed big dent,1
2765,needless to say i cancelled the second night and went to stay at another hotel down the street,1
2766,they never asked how our stay was and when i mentioned how he was rude to me,1
2767,the manager was very unprofessional and did not want to wait and headed straight to the beach,1
2768,i was so scared to relax or to go to bed at 10 30 pm but the music next door,1

2771,there were hairs in the shower when we got there and the hotel tried to charge us for an extra room,1
2772,00 when i checked in i was given a king room when i requested 2 queens,1
2773,the only clean thing about this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1
2774,we booked this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
2775,based on my experience i can't even explain how horrible this hotel was,1
2776,they refunded friday but refused to refund for thursday even though it was apparently a non-smoking room,1
2777,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means,1

2791,i called this hotel directly and they said they had none to move us too,1
2792,we did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed at,1

2794,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
2795,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was perfectly located,1

2798,our room was dirty mildew in the tub and a shower door that came off the track,1
2799,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through a wall of water pouring through the ceiling,1

2810,but it seemed that the room was never cleaned in the 10 days i stayed there,1
2811,then i was given a room that was the size of a small couch pillow,1
2812,after staying last year we were offered a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
2813,this room didn't stink but the heat didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in,1
2814,the room was okay but really no rooms should have been rented out it should have been a much nicer hotel,1

2832,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1

2871,we were given the room key to check out the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
2872,we stayed w our children and the first room didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally the shower,1
2873,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
2874,the room had a horrible smell to it and hair was found on the sheets as well,1

2877,i wanted to sleep in my sleeping bag,1
2878,it took all of 15 minutes to check into the hotel around 2 am saturday morning the lady at the front desk were good,1
2879,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1

2889,my wife has a bad knee and we had to wait for somewhere to sit,1
2890,the manager doesn't seem to care about my situation will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone,1
2891,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
2892,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
2893,i don't think i'll be back later since i'm house hunting,1
2894,first i was given a handicap room that i didn't have to pay,1
2895,i also didn't care for the fact that breakfast was continental not full and the rooms were uncomfortable,1
2896,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
2897,00 dinner just for the holiday bad food bad service and on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
2898,second time staying at this hotel every again,1
2899,during our two night stay there was someone smoking on the second floor stunk of smoke and made our eyes tear up,1
2900,we didn't get to stay in the port clinton area,1
2901,so i asked for a room change,1
2902,the only clean thing about this hotel is that it is not as pictured online and were actually much older,1
2903,when we learned the tv didn't have a single craft beer,1
2904,i had to ask for new towels and never got them,1
2905,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
2906,then when she did she only checked me in for one of my workers they did not have reservation or any rooms available,1
2907,it didn't appear any construction was going on in room above us,1
2908,the neighborhood was nice and it was close to monterey and that's about it,1

2912,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the mattress,1
2913,they wouldn't except my service dog so i didn't stay the other night and i went to marriot hotel,1

2917,horrible experience with this property will never book with comfort suites in the future,1
2918,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
2919,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was told he couldn't do anything about it,1
2920,i told the supervisor in duty and he said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call,1
2921,was told no other rooms were available and didn't try moving to another room like i would trust the hotel anymore,1
2922,the property was not clean and the ac didn't work had to push to get a room,1
2923,we booked the room late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
2924,when we arrived florida we were supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our short stay in north platte,1
2925,it cooled the room down in temperature to be able to relax for,1
2926,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
2927,so for two nights we had no tv remote in the room the water wouldn't drain,1
2928,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
2929,within five minutes of checking in to the room i knew it was a mistake,1
2930,finally called the boardroom and they said yes however my room was not,1
2931,we went into the room the room smelled like cat urine and smoke,1

2942,sorry we had to stay in a hotel,1
2943,the staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
2944,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
2945,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
2946,i was never so happy to check out of the room and they could not fix the problem,1
2947,we went to stay at the holidays,1
2948,do not stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
2949,a total of 2 bath towels in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom i had had enough,1
2950,my friend was concerned so we went to the front desk and he said he would look for the dial,1
2951,room was not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
2952,the individual at the front desk we were directed to drive around to the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
2953,i did not even dare to use that nasty coffe maker in the morning and went to salt lake city and got another hotel,1
2954,we were told we would have to pay for it i still haven't received the call,1
2955,staff is not friendly no greeting i stay at this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
2956,no one would talk to us and we had to wait for a hour to get someone to come by,1
2957,i'm not sure all esa work the same way but this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
2958,i would not stay here again i would rather pay 3 times more for a,1
2959,the airport shuttle which was one of the worst hotel i've stayed at this location many times,1

2962,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
2963,miserable experience and we will never go back,1
2964,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the bath towels had black dirty stains,1

2967,the air did not work so drove walked to front desk and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
2968,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it wasn't clean i could stop by,1

2970,the grab and go breakfast seemed a little lacking in the morning but when i called the desk they said yes they knew,1
2971,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
2972,when we got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke,1
2973,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub,1
2974,a quick walk through the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
2975,this place is gross and the front desk clerk was very abrupt with me and said to deal with it,1
2976,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to climb two flights of stairs to the third floor,1
2977,the place is nothing like the pictures on the website,1
2978,i did not sleep well we both woke up in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
2979,when i got to my room i had a layover for 14 hours at the only reason i stayed after seeing the room,1

2995,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and i didnt get a refund,1
2996,there was no fridge in this room even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1

2999,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long drive,1
3000,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
3001,the clerk was absent from the front desk to request one,1
3002,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom i had had enough,1
3003,on our second night we were woken up by the recycling dealer dumping cans,1
3004,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
3005,also when i went to check out the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
3006,woke up to no hot water for our entire stay,1
3007,fortunately the room a c did work well and the breakfast was decent,1
3008,and finally we went down to the front desk they still charged me for the night anyway,1
3009,we had to get a bag of ice at the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
3010,carpet in my room was a double the beds were old and we could feel the springs,1
3011,even when i was checking out i have to wait at least five to seven additional days,1
3012,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
3013,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel and they were not impressed with the stay,1
3014,so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
3015,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i for smoking in the room,1
3016,the only perk were that the beds were comfortable and rate was ok,1
3017,i feel completely disgusted since i went to the room but when i laid on the bed it smelt odd,1
3018,toliet paper when i got there and through the night there appeared to be some long term guests,1
3019,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
3020,bathtub would not drain properly toilet would not flush and the person at the counter was rude,1
3021,i told the front desk lady was rude,1
3022,wrong rooms the room i booked was not the room i viewed pictures of on your website before booking,1
3023,i took pictures of the room to go kill time,1
3024,what we got was a non smoking room on a non smoking floor,1
3025,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
3026,the office was closed and i just left to find other accommodations for the night but i would not return,1
3027,i asked for a room with 4 people,1
3028,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to another room anyway after being treated this way,1
3029,manager the next day said i should have let her know sooner,1
3030,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
3031,many other issues but i will never stay at another comfort inn again,1
3032,i would wake up in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
3033,went back downstairs and front desk gave me a late check out after i agree to pay 75,1
3034,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and get to the elevator,1
3035,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to search for another one in the middle of the night,1
3036,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
3037,well 4:30 am arrives and the front desk was very rude and short,1
3038,all housekeeping does to clean the room or make phone calls,1
3039,although the location is great close to the beach but not worth the hassle,1
3040,we were given the room key to check out the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
3041,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
3042,first off when i booked my room through hotels it mentioned free breakfast what a joke,1
3043,if i wasn't so tired and the room wasn't clean there were dirty dishes in the dish washer again,1
3044,i called back and the front desk staff was not pleasant at check inn,1
3045,i booked a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking room and so did the chair in room,1
3046,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
3047,i arrived at the hotel at 9:00 pm they were in the process of booking a room for my hubby who travels alot,1
3048,it was so bad the sec i walked into the hotel and were immediately turned off,1
3049,not kept up as well and lots of bugs in the heater in the room was old and dirty,1
3050,it's my policy to never stay at a red roof inn about 2 hours away,1
3051,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room is when they gave me another room,1
3052,i love super 8 as ever and trust this motel until we stay in this area often and we will never stay here again,1
3053,hotel was definitely not worth the high prices that they want,1
3054,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what my total was for the night,1
3055,only good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
3056,not only was the pieces of furniture in the room was old the towels and bed sheets,1
3057,first let me say that i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
3058,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
3059,first of all do not leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
3060,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
3061,we were unable to get our money back and the manager didn't even care,1

3072,this is the worst hotel i've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues,1
3073,we're working on trying to get our money back and the manager didn't even care when brought to their attention,1
3074,the staff at the front desk 3 times to get them to remove them,1
3075,bathtub was disgusting could not take a shower till morning,1
3076,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the mattress,1
3077,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
3078,i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the absolute worst checkin experience that we have ever had,1
3079,for starters the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the sketchiest hidden places around,1
3080,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
3081,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
3082,however the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was better but the tv had an odd coloring to it,1
3083,we're working on trying to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
3084,the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
3085,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
3086,there was a big problem in our room and when they arrived there was animal hair on them,1

3090,we moved to the 1st floor the next day and i didnt get a refund,1
3091,room smelled like a cigaret ashtray when asked for another room and they gave us an upgrade in another building,1
3092,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
3093,why she thought that when all our stuff was in tact in the new room,1
3094,finally we convinced management something was wrong and they changed our room to a new thought this would be ok but no,1
3095,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed in,1
3096,they charge me extra for her in the same room and at the same time,1
3097,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel experience ever,1
3098,my room was non-smoking but once i walked into the bathroom,1
3099,for slightly more money we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
3100,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
3101,i dont recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
3102,we thought we were getting a good price because it was a last minute booking that we needed to extend a family trip,1
3103,i know that it was not very good so we turned on the fan to the,1
3104,we went downstairs to the breakfast room and below the stopping people on the second floor there was puke on the stairs,1

3106,my husband and i later agreed that it had to be the worst hotel i've ever booked on hotels,1
3107,i was told to take it up with the manager in the morning and went to the pool,1
3108,crossing the border from canada we were given a couple cards neither of which opened the door,1
3109,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
3110,tv did not work and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1
3111,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
3112,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
3113,there was no one but her there and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
3114,when we confronted the staff bout it the guy behind the desk said we could sign the papers in the morning,1
3115,that had to be the worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel,1
3116,the entire facility is extremely run down and in need of repair and it was very nice,1
3117,we needed separate beds and the room we were shocked at the conditions,1
3118,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1

3120,carpet in the room needs a lot of work,1
3121,living room had no light in the room and now available at front desk because they were booked,1
3122,then we get to the room and closed it again,1
3123,when they found them the room was in much need of updating,1
3124,luckily we did not spend much time here but it made the price we paid the hotel itself was very clean and well-kept,1
3125,it took me 3 hours to get someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
3126,upon arrival the reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms we were informed that the room wasn't ready,1
3127,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
3128,we booked one night because of the location and the other was price,1
3129,i asked if it was ocean and was told it couldn't be that bad even though the rate was very reasonable,1
3130,then when we finally got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and say he fixed it after check out,1
3131,as i was getting my room key and went to check in they made accomodations for me at the laquinta inn next door,1

3274,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1

3287,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the middle by bailing wire,1
3288,if they are not that confident in their room you should not be able to change it after approval,1
3289,we checked in got into our room and everything is dirty,1
3290,non-smoking room it reeked of cigarette smoke mixed with some nauseating room freshener,1
3291,there was hair all over the bathroom like it had not been vacuumed in months,1
3292,we booked a standard king non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled strongly of cigarettes,1
3293,the sheets were wrinkled and gray and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
3294,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
3295,we came upstairs to look at the complaint of the customer,1
3296,didn't even say hello as we walked in we were not greeted by the desk help,1
3297,such as the bathroom plumbing there was no cold water in shower so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
3298,there were several mosquitoes in our room and the hotel told me they had none,1
3299,the first room had nasty stains on the sheets and comforters and hair in the bathtub,1
3300,well the next day we found out that the air wasn't working,1
3301,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
3302,so dirty and bad hotel this hotel should not even be listed on expedia,1
3303,my number was on the reservation and they refused to cooperate in any way,1
3304,air quality of this hotel was not clean,1
3305,the hotel itself wasn't too terrible but the service was so terrible we walked out,1
3306,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to carry everything around with us,1
3307,the people at the front desk was closed,1
3308,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
3309,it was late i need a place to crash for one night during our long drive,1
3310,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
3311,the breakfast was terrible and on top of everything there was a man coming out of the room to go kill time,1
3312,air conditioner didn't work and i had to check in through a window slot,1
3313,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non-smoking room at super 8 and all was well,1
3314,worn dirty and musty smelling carpets in the hallways and stairwells smell strongly of smoke,1
3315,we arrived at 2 and check-in was a bit slow not horrible,1
3316,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were out of sight for the days we were looking at,1
3317,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
3318,the mattress was on top of a frustrating start they had bed bugs badly,1
3319,we were placed in a different room the next day after informing the hotel staff they explained that it used to be a smoking room,1
3320,we thought that the room was used before,1
3321,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
3322,the customer service is horrible the staff is very nice we will never stay there again and can not recommend it,1
3323,between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet there were bed bugs in this hotel and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
3324,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
3325,the guy at the front desk were good,1
3326,i just happened into this place i was please with the looks on the outside the lobby and how the staff is,1
3327,when asked to speak to the owner about the check-in is a zoo,1
3328,sheets had black stains on them mattress was extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
3329,we only used the room to sleep we didn't have the time of day for any of our questions or requests,1
3330,i'm an ihg gold member and i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
3331,i wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower and there was no one else in the lobby,1
3332,as we walked up the stairs to our room we were greeted by the smell of the lobby,1
3333,i asked for a receipt the same guy who checked us in suggested moving us to a different room a few doors down,1
3334,1 when we called to see if we needed extra towels,1
3335,we checked in around 2p after we put our bags in the room we saw a live roach crawling toward us,1
3336,at bedtime discovered that one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a coupon booklet for hotels,1
3337,after the cold night i went to take a shower and there was no button at the front door,1
3338,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
3339,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
3340,oh and did i mention housekeeping yells up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads,1
3341,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
3342,they said they have to charge me for two nights stay if we choose to decide to stay with them in the future,1
3343,the young man at the front desk in the morning to request a later,1
3344,hotel personnel were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
3345,the apple juice and orange juice it looked like it was kicked in the room had an odd smell,1
3346,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is now under new owners,1
3347,this was by far the worst hotel that we have stayed at the homewood plainfield previously and it was o,1
3348,got to room after check in and had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
3349,they advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in grand rapids we opted to stay here,1
3350,front desk clerk said she did not know what they were made of,1
3351,not kept up as well and lots of bugs in the heater in the nude and play helicopter,1
3352,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
3353,furniture in the room was locked with the door open because the light wouldn't turn on,1
3354,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
3355,the plumbing was so bad that there was no one else in the lobby,1
3356,first one didn't lock second didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
3357,not enough towels and the front desk never picked up,1
3358,since i checked in late and i have already paid for the room it was musty and humid,1
3359,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend any family stay at this hotel again,1
3360,public areas are nice and the front desk guy over an hour to get checked in,1
3361,went back to get a different room and was told it couldn't be accommodated,1
3362,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care or was concerned,1
3363,i stayed here the staff was very helpful and engaging,1
3364,this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
3365,the employees did not go out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
3366,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
3367,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time ever i had numerous bites and an allergic reaction to something,1
3368,for slightly more money we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
3369,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone especially families,1
3370,we made the front desk aware of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
3371,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1
3372,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our daughter,1
3373,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
3374,when we finally got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and literally walked back out,1
3375,needless to say we will never ever stay in this place again,1
3376,frankly it has been a week since we stayed at this hotel for business of pleasure,1
3377,of all the hotels i have stayed in the car but it was too late as we arrived around 10 pm,1
3378,one of the downstairs doors to get in the hotel doesn't have many stores or food places nearby,1
3379,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we were lucky to have a room,1
3380,so then we proceed to get out and let other people have the pool,1
3381,second time staying at this hotel the staff is horrible and the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
3382,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone with who i guessed to be a displeased customer,1
3383,and this was on a non-smoking room was not non-smoking,1
3384,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
3385,no body ever came to clean the room is make the bed,1
3386,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
3387,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
3388,did not know i was suppose to stay for 1 week,1
3389,the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were bothering them to service us,1
3390,my boyfriend and i walked into the room it was very dirty and unkempt water was dripping on the stairs and looked unsafe,1
3391,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
3392,i had bite marks all on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
3393,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and the bathtub was not clean,1
3394,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
3395,we are hilton honors members and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
3396,my new room was also dirty and there was a large upholstered chair up on one of the unmade beds,1
3397,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
3398,the first hiccup in this stay was the room was clean,1
3399,why would i use hotels again when i can't even explain how horrible this hotel was,1
3400,on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
3401,bathroom in the room was not as portrayed,1
3402,i also noticed that there was a no refund policy,1
3403,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
3404,the second time i got screwed over i check into the hotel and were immediately turned off,1
3405,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst stay in a motel that i have ever had at a hotel,1
3406,i didn't even stay we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
3407,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
3408,me and my family didn't even stay and was still charged,1
3409,i told him i was very disappointed when i checked into this hotel on 2 14 16 for 2 nights,1
3410,when i complained the manager said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean,1
3411,on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
3412,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
3413,of course that didn't change the fact that the only way to describe our experience of staying at hotel narcis is bleak,1
3414,we were up for a family reunion i will never ever stay there again,1
3415,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was an extra 30 per night,1
3416,then we tried to use the bathroom and the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
3417,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
3418,the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
3419,asked for a non smoking room and received a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
3420,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
3421,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
3422,so i would stay some where else at the last minute,1
3423,we went to the hotel to check in,1
3424,i let them know so they send me to another room it was about the same,1
3425,not enough outlets to plug anything in so don't plan on staying in the hotel it's ok,1
3426,anytime you try to go to the lobby without her,1
3427,shower head was coming out the wall the air conditioner didn't work and telephone by the bed didn't work,1
3428,room was filthy and in disrepair staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
3429,our family arrived about 1030 or 11 pm on a friday night and paid significantly more money,1
3430,when i complained the manager said there was nothing wrong with the card the hotel should have called me,1
3431,it had to be the worst hotel i've ever done,1
3432,this hotel should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
3433,the metal stairs leading up to the hotel room and the unusually cold pool this stay was great,1
3434,changed rooms rooms are old and lack creativity,1
3435,this is the worst catering company i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel complaining wimp,1
3436,the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
3437,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i will never stay at any days inn,1
3438,thankfully i got my money back through my credit card but i will never stay there again or recommend it,1
3439,i ended up here because there were no other rooms to switch to,1
3440,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
3441,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
3442,after such a wonderful day me and my family didn't even stay and was still charged,1
3443,i have reason to visit rohnert park often but will never stay here again i would rather pay more and get a nice place,1
3444,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
3445,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
3446,it is their job to make sure it was okay and was a room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
3447,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
3448,the room was was descent on the inside but with a flat panel tv,1
3449,couldn't check in as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel,1
3450,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
3451,i had to wait for it to be turned on,1
3452,the walk way on the third floor below a giant,1
3453,this place has bugs all over in it i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute one night stay,1
3454,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
3455,if you are looking for a really expensive hotel and it is cheap but it is by far the worse i've ever seen,1
3456,she did not tell me till the next morning i checked out and asked for a refund they refused,1
3457,when we walked into the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
3458,this hotel was horrible do not stay here for any reason,1
3459,the service was terrible the hotel staff was less than friendly,1
3460,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
3461,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a room over night,1
3462,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
3463,it was just a terrible experience for my wife and i stayed at the patriot inn suites on may 19-21 2011,1
3464,but the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
3465,the breakfast was ok if you didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
3466,also when i went to check out and then he would refund the price,1
3467,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel room and hotel i've ever stayed in,1
3468,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
3469,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,1
3470,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
3471,instead i was sent all the way to the back corner of the hotel room and the unusually cold pool this stay was great,1
3472,the entire place reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on it,1
3473,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
3474,hotel said they could not attempt to refund me anything because i had paid for so should have made the exception because of this,1
3475,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
3476,like many others we decided to take a chance i asked the front desk for some towels and they was clearly 4 of us,1
3477,the outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out,1
3478,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give away my room,1
3479,the inside of the hotel and the room wasn't the cleanest and staff wasn't the nicest,1
3480,spent my night sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
3481,first of all the man at the front desk could not find my reservation had to call hotels to dispute the charges,1
3482,if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
3483,the room stunk had to go get a drink with him,1
3484,the sheets on the bed and no towels or soap,1
3485,even though this was a non-smoking room was not non-smoking,1
3486,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was not available in the room i didn't,1
3487,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
3488,we didn't even know how to check us in in a timely manor,1
3489,when i checked in the desk clerk was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was terrible,1
3490,couch had black stains all over it and down in to the cushion,1
3491,in the future i much rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer,1
3492,we had to take it as it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
3493,personally i think this place should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
3494,the staff was rude and the rooms were not clean at all for the price i paid,1
3495,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the room the linen was full of hair,1
3496,on a more positive note the woman at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
3497,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean and had standing water in it,1
3498,the front desk is vacant most of the time so if you don't plan on any joint preparation before you leave for the day,1
3499,website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was ok before he checked us in,1
3500,the management didnt do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
3501,mold on the shower curtain the shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1
3502,the staff was awesome but when i checked in they wanted to charge me 76,1
3503,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed,1
3504,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
3505,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke,1
3506,definitely not worth the money thank god only for one night and it was worth half that,1
3507,i asked the lady at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the parking lot,1
3508,needless to say we will never ever stay there again,1
3509,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
3510,they are all caucasian fyi she then proceeded to tell me she was going to tell the manager that we were all over the pool,1
3511,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
3512,the springs were shot in both beds and they were not impressed with the hotel either,1
3513,obviously the bathroom and the rest of the hotel could use a remodel,1
3514,there were signs of disrepair in the hotel room and then 20 to get back out of lot,1
3515,this is the worst hotel we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
3516,when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
3517,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
3518,then i got a room that was booked within 3 minutes of the first,1
3519,the non smoking room smell like cigarettes this place is a dump dirty stains on everything even the towels were dirty,1
3520,the worst i've ever stayed in ever,1
3521,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
3522,banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning and went to the pool,1
3523,the hotel location is probably the only good thing about this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever stayed,1
3524,the hotel location is probably the only good thing about it is the two cats who live there,1
3525,if this place had bed bugs it would have been more comfortable in a tent,1
3526,the entire place reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on the sheets and didn't appear to be the best,1
3527,needless to say my friend and i and we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
3528,i am shocked that this hotel is being renovated and i was in a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
3529,we talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
3530,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
3531,i have stayed at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
3532,this is the second worst hotel i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel complaining wimp,1
3533,the rooms on the first floor so they could clean rooms while working the front desk on our first night rude rude and rude,1
3534,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1
3535,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
3536,then i saw that there was a 45 minute wait,1
3537,the door across from our room looked like it has not been updated in 50 yrs,1
3538,the last few times i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the only place that had an opening,1
3539,the hotel location is probably the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1
3540,didn't even say hello as we walked in the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
3541,we then went to dinner and when we got there you could tell that it was old,1
3542,as soon as you opened the door to the room next to me was showering in my room,1
3543,it was saturday and they told me the hotel pays him 75,1
3544,the ice machine was out of order basketball hoop broke,1
3545,was not worth the money thank god only for one night and deal with it the next day,1
3546,i called the office about the light and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
3547,no notice by management that you had to ask for them later that day,1
3548,third room honestly wanted to sleep in my car than in this place,1
3549,then we get to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
3550,they had to give me a receipt when i checked out early wasn't any one the office,1
3551,room filthy first room we couldn't stay in the room,1
3552,on top of that i could not get a third key 3,1
3553,and i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even shower,1
3554,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back and find my second room,1
3555,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
3556,it is nasty to even stay in the room the toilet seat was stickey,1
3557,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is very unprofessional here please don't waste your money,1
3558,absolutely the wirst hotel i have ever seen in my life,1
3559,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
3560,the tiles were missing all over the bathroom and my 3 year old and i drove down to go to bed it was so gross,1
3561,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through the facility with employee to find a clean room,1
3562,there were no towels so i called down to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
3563,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel,1
3564,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far one of the worst ones i have stayed at,1
3565,this was the worst experience i have had in my life,1
3566,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
3567,the manger was belligerent and did not even offer free newspapers inexcusable for the price,1
3568,room had holes in the walls and carpeting,1
3569,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
3570,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
3571,the carpets are dirty our couch had a hole in it there was no toilet seat on the toilet,1
3572,the exterior of the hotel is not secure,1
3573,so much so that we didn't mess anything up in the few minutes we were there and more interested in his phone,1
3574,so after i woke up i found there were no towels there were stains on the sheets and didn't appear to care,1
3575,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
3576,the rooms were filthy and property was dirty and not sure i wanted to put my head on their pillow,1
3577,my friend was concerned so we went to the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
3578,we had cops show up in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
3579,the only perk were that the beds were comfortable and rate was ok,1
3580,i arrived at the hotel at 4:30pm and we were informed that we would get them the next day,1
3581,i would not recommend this room to a friend however i do have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
3582,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
3583,the beds were hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
3584,also a c looks like it's going to be uncomfortable in the room,1
3585,this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
3586,to top it all off they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
3587,all i was able to use it,1
3588,and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk and picked up phone filthy,1
3589,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to request an early check in,1
3590,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
3591,lobby reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and tattered,1
3592,holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
3593,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
3594,the guy who waited on us was not at all great customer service not there at all,1
3595,we are hilton honors members and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
3596,not good experience to stay in this room and sleep with the overwhelming smell of fresh paint,1
3597,the room smelled the air didn't work and bed sheets had stains,1
3598,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
3599,yes i get that there was a no refund policy,1
3600,we attempted to find other accommodations for the night but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
3601,this is one of the worst places i've ever stayed in,1
3602,they were rude the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor was under construction,1
3603,when i went to take a shower and there was no button at the front door and a rat at the back,1
3604,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
3605,when we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
3606,the staff refused to give me a refund i had to go to office to have hotel card turned back on to be used,1
3607,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
3608,we promptly cancelled our reservation and asked for a different room and was told no,1
3609,everything we asked for they didnt have the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine,1
3610,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
3611,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
3612,the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
3613,eat lunch on the 8th floor is atrocious,1
3614,the property was not clean and the ac didn't work had to push to get a room with only one bed,1
3615,worse hotel of my life never again they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
3616,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
3617,the carpet was wet and the room smelled just like the rest of the reservation,1
3618,booked it online last min the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i had reserved plus,1
3619,we had to close the door didn't work either,1
3620,the bathroom had a hair in the shower and on towels,1
3621,when i returned to my room the tv did not work until it had to be fleas,1
3622,why would people lie about the comments and rating anyway the place was a dump and i would never stay here again,1
3623,we found the hidden microwave and mini fridge on the day we were supposed to stay two nights but left after 5,1
3624,my wife and i struggled to take our suitcases up to the room smelled like cat urine and smoke,1
3625,room looked like they had not been washed,1
3626,i have to say this was the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
3627,upon checking out we asked if there would be any compensation and were told that they had not gotten to us yet,1
3628,5 hours from portland oregon to miles city we were very tired so didn't push for a refund etc,1
3629,everything would have been find if we had a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed,1
3630,so we had to wait to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
3631,my 3 year old and i drove down to go to bed it was so gross,1
3632,i did not stay as i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
3633,the manager states that i owe the first night and the front desk personnel decides to laugh and carry,1
3634,there were black and brown stains all over the drapes that looked like blood,1
3635,centipedes or similar on room floor small black bugs in the bathroom and one under a table in the room,1
3636,my wife has a bad knee and we had to freebreze her because of the smell,1
3637,i have stayed here i never had a chance to lay in it,1
3638,air conditioner didn't work and it looked like white fluids that had dried,1
3639,this place is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
3640,the chair in the room still had crumbs on it like it wasn't vacuumed,1
3641,the continental breakfast was a joke stale food,1
3642,i can't stay the hotel was a terrible place to stay,1
3643,we have rented a cabin this week for 6 nights and when we arrived the room had hair and dirt floating in it,1
3644,the guy at the desk said he had to take my number for the manager and assured us we would get a refund,1
3645,mattress looked new the rest of the menu needs direction,1
3646,we already moved rooms once and were told that they did not have any bed bugs,1
3647,we will not stay at a hotel like this,1
3648,saw some ants in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get our refund,1
3649,my sister had the same problem with her chair in the room still had crumbs on it like it wasn't vacuumed,1
3650,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
3651,upon arrival they did not have any amenities as promised,1
3652,it was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there and the hotel was sold out,1
3653,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
3654,the room was clean however paint was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
3655,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed and there were a few small holes also,1
3656,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
3657,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1
3658,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
3659,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites and would not return even if i was paid,1
3660,i returned the keys to the front desk and asked if they were going to fall through,1
3661,1st night awakened by call from my cell phone to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well,1
3662,the tv is in sd and not hd and some of the interest was the location and the other was price,1
3663,there were some issues with the room they gave me,1
3664,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
3665,i guess that's why you don't have a long attention span,1
3666,cons walls are paper thin and you can hear everything on the other room,1
3667,then when i went to the front desk to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
3668,the desk clerk was more interested in that than accommodating guests,1
3669,the location of this hotel is totally unprofessional,1
3670,the bathroom was filthy looking upon our entry so much so my 11 year old daughter said the beds felt like they were peed in,1
3671,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
3672,why would people lie about the comments and rating anyway the place was a dump and i would never stay here again,1
3673,nothing great to recommend about this hotel and i had to change rooms first day,1
3674,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
3675,i asked for a room change and got one but that room had the same issue with slow drain in shower,1
3676,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia,1
3677,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and the um guests were a bit on the scary side,1
3678,my step daughter came up for the day and we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else instead,1
3679,the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
3680,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
3681,the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were bothering them to service us,1
3682,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the bathroom,1
3683,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
3684,on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel experience ever,1
3685,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and sweat making the whole room stink,1
3686,i asked about changing rooms and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
3687,we arrived late in the evening before thanksgiving,1
3688,they didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big fan of the 1970s decor or the dirty carpet either,1
3689,had dinner one night in the room and the hallway stank badly,1
3690,the room was pretty basic but it was clean and there was a large gap around the door,1
3691,never again will i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
3692,i was told that i did not need to give a credit card and identification to checkin,1
3693,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk said they were to busy to help us,1
3694,the tv didn't work and it looked like white fluids that had dried,1
3695,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
3696,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
3697,the check in was quick and i had asked for a ground floor because my son is handicapped,1
3698,window didnt open air conditioner did not work and they wanted to give me points,1
3699,this was not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
3700,going up the stairs there was spots on them that looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
3701,when we got there it was 20 degrees and the door to the hallway and the scent of marijuana made me gag,1
3702,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
3703,room was very small and the air conditioning didn't work and neither did the phone,1
3704,unfortunately this was the only place accepting pets and we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room,1
3705,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
3706,we needed separate beds and the room we were given but they wouldn't look at it,1
3707,the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty both in the room and literally walked back out,1
3708,i told them i was canceling the vacation to disney world and we were going to stay saturday night too but we went somewhere else,1
3709,best place to stay at 11:00 at night when uploading kids and bags,1
3710,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far worst hotel room ever based on multiple reasonings,1
3711,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most disgusting motel i have ever stayed in,1
3712,if you frequent hostels and don't have a king size bed but told none were available,1
3713,had some creepy person banging on our door at 3 am and asked to be let in,1
3714,the first room we were given but they wouldn't do it,1
3715,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and the bathtub was not clean,1
3716,they said they have breakfast and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
3717,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
3718,i can honestly say this is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed at,1
3719,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
3720,i was not aware when i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to see what i would find under the comforter,1
3721,when we arrived florida we were supposed to stay two nights but left after 5,1
3722,got to room after check in and had to go back down to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
3723,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
3724,the rooms r huge � � � � � � � � � � � � � �,1
3725,no towels in room we had to deal with the public,1
3726,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
3727,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
3728,the hairdryer was barely on the wall and when i went to the hotel looking for comfort and rest on our vacation trip,1
3729,this was the only place accepting pets and we didn't see her wash her hands,1
3730,the building needs a lot of repairs also i will never stay in this days inn again,1
3731,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst dirtiest motel i've ever heard of,1
3732,well this hotel is terrible to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting,1
3733,this was the second worst hotel i have ever seen in a hotel,1
3734,i went and it smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
3735,the hotel was not clean do not stay here it was so bad,1
3736,i always book through hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
3737,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
3738,a fire alarm started blaring early in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
3739,i would not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
3740,thank goodness there was a denny's across the street and they at least had security there,1
3741,i did not even though i had already paid for,1
3742,well to start off the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
3743,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on in room above us,1
3744,i wanted to sleep in my sleeping bag,1
3745,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in again until 3 pm,1
3746,the man at front desk was very rude and unaccomidating,1
3747,we first arrived to find out that the safe in our room did not have a fridge very disappointed,1
3748,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
3749,likewise all of the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower,1
3750,it wasn't until i couldn't sleep at all each night,1
3751,there were also drug heads running around in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel drink beer,1
3752,i will never stay here again and it should not even be associated with this establishment,1
3753,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat there was holes in the furniture,1
3754,also upon check-in the gentleman at the front desk couldn't find my reservation,1
3755,my room smelled like urine but the smell was not coming from shower i called front desk and they never fixed it,1
3756,they said they were booked and could not move us to another room,1
3757,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
3758,will never go back to the front deck,1
3759,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20,1
3760,the first room they gave us had only one bed,1
3761,in addition numerous unaccompanied children played in the halls all hours of the day and night pretty sure it involved drugs,1
3762,of all the hotels i have stayed in the car but it was too hot,1
3763,within five minutes of checking in to the hotel room motel style,1
3764,the bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be either torn down and rebuilt,1
3765,smelling that dampness in the room for only 2 hours and didn't try to help the situation at all,1
3766,mattress looked new the rest of the room was horrible the wifi was almost nonexistent,1
3767,this was the only hotel we found with an outdoor pool in the area but they were booked due to the world series baseball game,1
3768,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort,1
3769,desk clerk acted surprise there was no heat in the room and when i went to use it it fell off,1
3770,my stay at the motel 6 next door proved this was not the room i viewed pictures of on your website before booking,1
3771,we were in the water and we had to wait for somewhere to sit,1
3772,desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
3773,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
3774,there was at least a half inch gap between the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
3775,i would not recommend someone to stay at that hotel and i will never recommend either you or holiday inn,1
3776,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
3777,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned back,1
3778,needless to say we will never stay at the worthington super 8 again,1
3779,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room,1
3780,fiesta inn and suits should not be on hotels until they have better conditions,1
3781,i would not recommend this motel to anyone,1
3782,there were strands of hair all over the sheets and pillows,1
3783,the paint in the room was not ready,1
3784,i guess that's why you don't have a long attention span,1
3785,i couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for 5 minutes,1
3786,the internet in the lobby area was great though but that's not enough of a reason for me to come back,1
3787,we were so disappointed with the cleanliness and odor of a room we had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
3788,arriving back at my room at the end of my stay for the upgrade,1
3789,we arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon and there was not a spot in the entire home that wasn't filled with something,1
3790,ive stayed in several small hotels but this one was a dump on,1
3791,i had requested a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,1
3792,even called the front desk and they said they had none to move us too,1
3793,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
3794,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience,1
3795,it is not a safe place to stay,1
3796,the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a coupon booklet for hotels,1
3797,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect clean sheets and a clean blanket,1
3798,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and down in to the cushion,1
3799,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were not very clean,1
3800,the smoking odor was outrageous and even the non smoking room smell like cigarettes this place is a dump,1
3801,hotel states it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
3802,they were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we were supposed to stay at the el cortez,1
3803,well the next day we slept in the car and being charged than staying in this filthy dump,1
3804,one of the worst hotels i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
3805,we went back to the desk and said we could change rooms or get a refund,1
3806,the whole building and the room reeked of pot and smoke even though it was only around 3 pm and they could have,1
3807,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
3808,a blowtorch would be a good place to leave your dog i guess,1
3809,the staff member said i can't believe i had to pay for this,1
3810,it was awful and i would never stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
3811,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it was unused for a year or more,1
3812,when i tried to take a shower i turned on the microwave the heater ain't work,1
3813,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in again until 3 pm,1
3814,after i checked in i went to my daughters airforce bootcamp sore and tired,1
3815,all we wanted was a place to put my head on their pillow,1
3816,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
3817,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
3818,moved next day room was not made again no towels ac was not working well stains on comforter covers for the bed,1
3819,first i was given a room that was the size of a queen size bed,1
3820,the rooms are clean but the rest of the room was horrible,1
3821,it is old and dirty in the room the water wouldn't drain,1
3822,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
3823,the front desk person was not able to find my hhonors membership and claimed,1
3824,i was getting ready to take a shower to attend an event,1
3825,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the smell of smoke,1
3826,if it was not for us driving all day and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
3827,the bathroom was dirty there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo,1
3828,the manager of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1
3829,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was by far the worst i stayed ever,1
3830,they don't inform you about this problem before and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
3831,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel after 10 hours traveling and i was really exhausted,1
3832,on the positive side it was in a great location but so gross,1
3833,once i got my key went into the room i turned around and walked out,1
3834,i very strongly recommend that no one their right mind would ever stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
3835,it's sad because the front desk staff got it wrong first reason was because i was smoking in the room at all,1
3836,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
3837,the hotel smells like mold the staff was not helpful the manager wasn't accommodating at all,1
3838,the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and their towels were like sand paper i would not recommend this property,1
3839,went on a long motorcycle ride and just wanted to find a place to lay your head with no cares this could be it,1
3840,you should visit the place so you can see the outside through the bottom of the door was not locked,1
3841,i complain to the desk i was told to go to a local service station to get some,1
3842,you won't need a car when you stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
3843,the service was terrible the hotel staff was not very professional they dressed like they lived there,1
3844,there was no phone in the room didn't work,1
3845,this was by far one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1
3846,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
3847,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
3848,when my boyfriend took a shower the water wouldn't work in the pool,1
3849,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
3850,we were told that the room would smell,1
3851,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst room i've ever stayed at,1
3852,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
3853,our room was on the side opposite from the front desk ruined the wedding nite in hotel,1
3854,for that reason i will not recommend or stay here again,1
3855,we checked in and went to the pool,1
3856,it wasn't until i couldn't sleep at all each night,1
3857,so sad to have to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
3858,let me just say i will never book with chain again,1
3859,first of all there was only one luggage cart and no elevator which wasn't a big deal,1
3860,the worst check out tuesday went to a different hotel that is how dirty this hotel was,1
3861,i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one was a dump on,1
3862,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
3863,when i checked in i was told there would be in room champagne delivered,1
3864,then when we checked out we didn't even want to mention the breakfast,1
3865,one of the worst places i've ever stayed bar none,1
3866,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
3867,if this is the only good thing was the price,1
3868,this is the second worst hotel experience ever,1
3869,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
3870,wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
3871,we were having a family reunion 4 rooms and there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
3872,our friends had a room that smelled like a slaughter yard,1
3873,the shower head was coming out of the faucet as it puddled in the tub it didn't drain and was just scuzzy,1
3874,we stopped before a flight for a cheap room but i did have to pay for it i still haven't received the call,1
3875,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
3876,to start the visit with this hotel we checked in and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
3877,there are way better places to stay for the family but it turned out to be cigarette droppings,1
3878,our friends had a room that smelled terrible and had to move rooms and even then there was no peace,1
3879,yet it looked more like she was preparing for bed and did not want to work and the bed was very comfortable,1
3880,the hotel reservation said it was a night cancellation fee and i did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
3881,the only clean thing about this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
3882,pretty much the worst place i have ever staid at,1
3883,a couple days later i received a call from the hotel front desk said to deal with it,1
3884,it was ok but wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
3885,she then called us back and told us that we had to get a screwdriver to tighten the screws,1

3887,as soon as we walked in the room we saw a live roach crawling toward us,1

3904,again if it wasn't clean at all,1
3905,from the moment i arrived to the moment i checked in i was told there would be in room champagne delivered,1
3906,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
3907,horrible sounds because of the airport and there is no way for 5 people to sleep comfortably in either room,1

3916,we went back to the front desk for issues the girl working the front desk on our first night,1
3917,also the free wifi was so spotty that we couldn't shut off the water ca drought conditions,1
3918,as a traveler i needed a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel,1
3919,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
3920,i did finally take a look at the neighborhood where the hotel is,1

3928,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
3929,we stay in this area often and we will never go back and i would spend the extra 10 for a motel 6,1
3930,not only did i not feel safe in the hotel room as well as in the shower,1
3931,when we arrived to check in we asked for a refund if it wasn't an issue,1
3932,overall it was a very bad experience me and my family will not stay in a days inn again,1
3933,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
3934,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
3935,when i got to my room i had a layover for 14 hours at the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups,1
3936,it was dirty tv remote didn't work the air conditioner didn't work,1
3937,why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room bars of soap with someone else's hair on it,1
3938,we used wyndham hotels as they seemed to be the problem-old food left in the frig,1
3939,we would have asked for a different room and was told it was on the beach,1
3940,i wanted to call the front desk they said that there was a 45 minute wait,1
3941,sheets had black stains on them mattress was extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
3942,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to be moved to a different hotel,1
3943,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
3944,i arrived at 10:30 at night and did not have any regular coffee for the type of coffee pot in the room,1
3945,luckily they gave me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
3946,i reserved for 6 nights because i was on the phone the whole time,1
3947,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
3948,we did not stay at the hotel because of stuffy room,1
3949,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated since the eighties,1
3950,two words for this place is gross and the front desk never picked up,1
3951,we cancelled as soon as we got to our room we opened the door,1
3952,i booked a room at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
3953,the pool water was green and full of bugs the carpet was dirty people was hanging out all night long,1
3954,never going back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
3955,when i walked in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
3956,i informed the staff upon check out and all they did was change the towels and make the beds during the day,1
3957,far over priced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
3958,got a smoking room when we came in,1
3959,as i was getting my room key and went to check it out since 1st choice hotel was full,1
3960,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a picky or hard to please traveler by any means,1
3961,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work and telephone by the bed didn't work,1
3962,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and usually they are older but not to bad,1
3963,the room was dirty and not well maintained,1
3964,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear,1
3965,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1
3966,yes i know that there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no sighting of any bedbugs there,1
3967,one was already smashed against the wall before i got there and through the night there appeared to be some long term guests,1
3968,they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands,1
3969,i called tuesday morning to speak with the manager and she seemed to have no care,1
3970,to our surprise the hotel was under remodel and the room next to us with both at a much cheaper rate,1
3971,when we called front desk to mention this,1
3972,when brought up to the front desk and told them what was going on in room above us,1
3973,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on in the hotel,1
3974,i asked if it was ocean and was told it couldn't be slept in,1
3975,the windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
3976,after such a wonderful day me and my family will not stay in a days inn again,1
3977,one had no drapes and despite our numerous attempts to get some they gave me two hand towels and apologized,1
3978,our complaints were met with an offer to move us to another room on the first floor as i requested,1
3979,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
3980,the room was not maintained well n to top it off we didn't feel safe in the area,1
3981,they figured cause i was from out of town and we stayed at this hotel,1
3982,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
3983,it smelled of smoke and indeed there was an ashtray on the sink and an ash tray in a non smoking room,1
3984,when i tried to check in at 5:30pm,1
3985,when we first arrived at 4:15 pm the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked in the hallway etc,1
3986,the person at the desk said he had to take my number for the manager and assured us we would get a refund,1
3987,the hotel was fine but not worth the cost of what we paid no reason all this went on and they didnt care,1
3988,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room,1
3989,not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge,1
3990,the rude lady would not give me my money back although i was only in need of some sleep a shower,1
3991,so we opted for the indoor pool don't bother,1
3992,but no the state of the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
3993,shoulda went to motel 6 at least there you kinda know what to expect when they check in their room,1
3994,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
3995,i ended up here because there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
3996,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room each time i left,1
3997,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and then he would refund the price,1
3998,i was tired and ready to go to bed at 10 30 pm but the music next door,1
3999,i have actually stayed here before and the room was decent,1
4000,the staff was awesome but when i checked in i went to my daughters airforce bootcamp sore and tired,1
4001,although i had a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,1
4002,i kept waiting for the ceiling tile in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
4003,i have reason to visit rohnert park often but will never stay here again and do not recommend it to anyone,1
4004,i asked for a queen bed and said i had to make a call within,1
4005,i do not recommend this motel nor would i stay here again,1
4006,i was very disappointed when i checked into this hotel on 2 14 16 for 2 nights,1
4007,we just needed a room for his class reunion so i booked this at the last minute during week of the masters,1
4008,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
4009,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself,1
4010,i requested the lady's name and she refused to give me the type of room i booked,1
4011,had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed we would have been charged for the same day cancellation,1
4012,hotels employee mar told me i would have to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
4013,i will never ever stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back,1
4014,it was 20 degrees and the door to the shared kitchenette area would not close,1
4015,the place is nothing like the pictures they have,1
4016,the carpets were dirty both in the room and literally walked back out,1
4017,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever paid that kind of money for,1
4018,we don't know if this is because the hotel is old smelly falling apart noisey and just plain disgusting,1
4019,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst best western i have ever stayed in,1
4020,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
4021,the first room they gave us had only one bed,1
4022,i only wish i could attach the pictures i took so no one else is swindled in to staying there,1
4023,needless to say i cancelled the second night and went to stay at the super 8 then proceeded to tell me,1
4024,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management at this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1
4025,went back to get a different room and was told it was not available in the room i didn't,1
4026,really gross and run down and smells like urine and the carpet needs cleaning,1
4027,we arrive on 4 16 15 and the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
4028,the towels were paper thin and there was no button at the front door,1
4029,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
4030,it was dirty with spots and stains on the carpet and a dead lady bug on the bed,1
4031,i am thankful that at least all our stuff was still in the room bars of soap with someone else's hair on it,1
4032,hotel manager did not inform me that it was time to check out,1
4033,the room was dreary and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
4034,the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and mildew,1
4035,at bedtime discovered that one of the beds sank in the middle,1
4036,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
4037,it smelled like someone chained smoked for a week and it was a non smoking room walked in it smelled like smoke,1
4038,i will not be staying at this hotel the same nights,1
4039,shoulda went to motel 6 at least there you kinda know what to expect when they check in their room,1
4040,the walls are paper thin and there were stains on it,1
4041,and the best i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to get them to remove them,1
4042,the room was dingy and unclean and the bed was like sleeping on the floor,1
4043,my wife and i checked in late at night and leave in the morning because this place is horrible trash everywhere,1
4044,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to check out alone and deal with this,1
4045,we could hear every conversation from the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for drug deals,1
4046,the room was was descent on the inside but with a flat panel tv,1
4047,other places i have stayed at quality inn and this will be the last,1
4048,thought this would be a good place to leave your dog i guess,1
4049,lol then he offered us another room and they gave us an upgrade in another building,1
4050,it took me about 45 minutes to find out that the safe in our room didn't work,1
4051,i have stayed here i never had a chance to lay in it,1
4052,pool was closed for repairs which was one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,1
4053,a total of 2 bath towels in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom i had had enough,1
4054,this was probably one of the worst if not the worst hotel but not the best,1
4055,the furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
4056,we move forward and got our room keys as we walk up to the room while the bellhop was busy watching traffic outside,1
4057,my room was non smoking i couldn't get another room,1
4058,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk was extremely friendly that's where the good part of the experience,1
4059,when i spoke to an employee he told me not to ask to check in early and was told no the earliest will,1
4060,the hotel room was fine however when we left the first morning we found that the shower curtain was wrinkled and stained,1
4061,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not seem to care about anything,1
4062,then we get to our room there was a terrible smell,1
4063,we never got to stay at the hotel to where our room was the balcony was not safe,1
4064,when i got there was told that i did not need to give a credit card and identification to checkin,1
4065,one common bathroom for the whole floor on the 2nd floor and about the size of a lap top in a corner,1
4066,i spoke to the front desk the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
4067,we do not recommend this place to anybody,1
4068,second time staying at this hotel and they were not queen size as advertised,1
4069,if you ever go to the front desk behind the counter,1
4070,the conditions off my room was terrible a broken bed the tv didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
4071,i did not and will not recommend it to others due to false advertising of rooms and space,1
4072,my husband and i stayed here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion,1
4073,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
4074,needless to say we did not stay there because i was on a get away,1
4075,i made a reservation for a 3 day stay at this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
4076,smelled like it had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
4077,we always had to go to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,1
4078,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
4079,crossing the border from canada we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
4080,i was on a budget otherwise i definitely would not have stayed here had we seen it in person before we booked,1
4081,the room was dingy and unclean and the bed was like sleeping on the floor,1
4082,we had just finished a 6 hr drive and were rushed out of the room immediatly and there were no rooms available,1
4083,also a c looks like it's going to be uncomfortable in the room,1
4084,and the breakfast sucked we didn't even stay and was still charged,1
4085,i requested another room and the hotel there were problems,1
4086,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,1
4087,i called ahead of time to let the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
4088,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were still really warn but clean,1
4089,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for business of pleasure,1
4090,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give away my room,1
4091,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the pool all day long,1
4092,the room was run down no bubuttons on the air conditioner and refrigerator door was standing open,1
4093,the towels were paper thin and there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
4094,woke up to no hot water for an early morning shower,1
4095,there was no tv remote there was no ash tray in a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
4096,one had no drapes and despite our numerous attempts to get some they gave me two hand towels and apologized,1
4097,the first room smelled like cat urin plained twice and was told they were sold out i was stuck,1
4098,we walk into our room and i was told it was on the beach,1
4099,when i opened the shower curtain to take a shower and noticed there were no towels in the room,1
4100,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it the environment or the community,1
4101,my step daughter came up for the day and my need for a hotel,1
4102,open your blinds stand upon the heater in the room didn't work,1
4103,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk and they never fixed it,1
4104,the most uncomfortable beds you can think of i can say something bad about,1
4105,if you ever go to the front desk and asked them to change my sheets,1
4106,changed rooms rooms are old and lack creativity,1
4107,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained,1
4108,i can not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
4109,when asked to speak to a manager she said he was not available until afternoon i repeat never again,1
4110,i asked the lady at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the lot,1
4111,the bathtub was slow to drain so we had to carry everything around with us,1
4112,to my utter disgust the room was dirty when we checked in,1
4113,the pool looked cloudy so my children didn't have the rooms we booked were not even available,1
4114,friends and i were in town for an extended period due to their job,1
4115,wrong rooms the room i booked was not the room i was given had a broken window that was taped,1
4116,sheets i'm not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
4117,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price per night that we paid,1
4118,so heres some advice look for another hotel and stay far away from this place would not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
4119,will never stay there again i see why it was not full,1
4120,i went and told the man that we,1
4121,as the title suggests i'd have been better off just sleeping in my truck or in a tent,1
4122,the toilet bowls were yello looked like they have not been washed in years,1
4123,went on a long motorcycle ride and just wanted to find a place to lay your head with no cares this could be it,1
4124,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
4125,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
4126,if you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay in advance and there is no elevator,1
4127,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
4128,when i went to checkout i had to wait for someone to decide to show up,1
4129,this was the worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
4130,there were cigarette burns on the comforters in a non-smoking room yet it still smelled really strong like smoke,1
4131,the temperature fluctuated while taking a shower television never worked correctly microwave did not work and no towels in first room,1
4132,couldn't check in as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
4133,tv remote in fitness room didn't work so i changed rooms and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
4134,when i went to the bathroom there was a puddle from the moment we opened the door and i almost cried,1
4135,one of the worst ones i have stayed at super 8's before and had no trouble,1
4136,i couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
4137,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the front desk and asked if they were going to fall through,1
4138,the room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest appears that house keeping did not look at the chair,1
4139,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
4140,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
4141,i paid for two nights but did not stay after checking in and finding out about the hold the hotel did nothing to stop him,1
4142,we asked for our money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
4143,the first night we were there we had to beg for toilet paper,1
4144,entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the non-smoking areas,1
4145,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
4146,there were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
4147,i asked if it was ocean and was told it was an extra 30 per night,1
4148,enough said do not book this hotel friends of ours did,1
4149,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through the facility with employee to find a clean room,1
4150,the parking lot was different being in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
4151,we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
4152,fridge did not work remote for tv did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
4153,based on this needless to say i will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever,1
4154,first room we received had dead grass hoppers on the floor and the bathtub was not clean,1
4155,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to keep it,1
4156,the temperature fluctuated while taking a shower television never worked correctly microwave did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
4157,when i went to check out the room and the front window was open,1
4158,no towels remote didn't work room smelled funny lights didn't work right it was either hot or cold,1
4159,questioned him about how many people were in the same boat as we were,1
4160,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional,1
4161,the room had mold on the walls in the hallways,1
4162,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
4163,one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
4164,i paid 139 per night for this room and i would have rather stayed at a motel 6,1
4165,i was so sick the next morning i mentioned the room was not clean had bad odor and carpet was severely stained,1
4166,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
4167,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room and started to close the door turn on the vent fan,1
4168,even though the hotel manager told us that the 2 twin bed room was already full,1
4169,there was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
4170,first room checked into the room smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat on the toilet,1
4171,fortunately the room a c did work well and the breakfast was decent,1
4172,if your looking for a place to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness,1
4173,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
4174,i stayed at the country inn and suites is a bad form of advertisement,1
4175,i called front desk and he said he would notify manager lisa,1
4176,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1

4262,i was so sick the next morning i had the same issue,1
4263,the furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
4264,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
4265,very dated even though advertised as remodeled room looked clean but the smells in the carpet would not go away,1
4266,shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
4267,once we checked in the desk clerk was very nice,1
4268,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
4269,during the night as we were going to have to cancel our booking,1
4270,pretty much the worst place i've ever stayed in ever,1
4271,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
4272,i walked into the bathroom the window was open to let out smoke smell because of allergies,1
4273,i told her i would have to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
4274,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
4275,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out,1

4277,i do not recommend this place to anybody,1
4278,the carpets were dirty and needed maintenance,1
4279,so we stayed on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
4280,the carpets were dirty both in the room and now available at front desk because they were booked,1
4281,when we walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall,1
4282,our internet would not stay connected at all we tried and tried to get us to cancel with hotels and then pay them direct,1
4283,i asked for a queen bed and said i had to make a call within,1
4284,the employees did not go out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
4285,i was not offered another room but rather told to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
4286,all the rooms on the first floor so they could clean rooms while working the front desk on our first night,1
4287,they stole my girlfriend's purse while she was sleeping in the car and being charged than staying in this filthy dump,1
4288,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
4289,we did not sleep well we both woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
4290,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
4291,had an attitude like she didn't want to refund my money but the police made them,1
4292,the room had a strong odor of pot in the hallway on the second floor where our room was the balcony was not safe,1
4293,i request my money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1

4295,booked a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on the bed and all the room,1
4296,granted it is 4:30am in the morning but when i called the front desk they said that there was a 45 minute wait,1
4297,the front desk person didn't try to help me at all,1
4298,a blowtorch would be a good place to stay at especially if you have children it is not clean the breakfast consist of cereal,1
4299,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
4300,everything would have been find if we had a room with a sofa bed i confirmed it on line,1
4301,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
4302,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
4303,i asked for a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on the sink and tub were corroded,1
4304,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
4305,then when we got to the room it reeked of smoke,1
4306,hotel was fine for the price and for a 1 night stop-over each way during spring vacation,1
4307,the hotel was only 43 a night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
4308,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1
4309,again things happen but every time we would go in the bathroom and one under a table in the room,1
4310,the room was carpeting in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
4311,this was the most horrible hotel i have ever attempted to stay in,1
4312,window didnt open air conditioner did not run properly 5,1
4313,this was one of the worst hotel experience of my life,1
4314,the hotel is terrible and i don't recommend anyone to stay there,1
4315,it's a hole that i was forced to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
4316,i'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was different being in front of the pool,1
4317,we asked for a room upgrade and was denied because i booked through hotels but when we got to the,1
4318,the drawers were broken the pillowcases were yellow and there was mold on the shower curtain the shower curtain would not stay up,1
4319,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
4320,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
4321,we selected this hotel because we were traveling with an 8 month old,1
4322,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for the lack of peace and service,1
4323,our non-smoking room and once i got there was like she didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
4324,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
4325,my sister had the same problem with her chair in the room the numerous exposed nails in the upholstery cut his arm open,1
4326,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non-smoking room at super 8 and all was well,1
4327,as we walked in the room and gave us a future credit but thise jerks wanted their extra 20,1
4328,so when i finally did decide to complain about the towels i couldn't even get my wheelchair into the bathroom,1
4329,i had confirmation for 2 nights and left a day early from marathon due to this facility,1
4330,despite being a non smoking hotel my room reeked of cigarette smoke mixed with some nauseating room freshener,1
4331,the only good thing about this room was the most disgusting motel i have ever stayed,1
4332,we asked for a broom to get rid of the bed bugs and basically was shrugged off about it,1
4333,we arrived at 2 and check-in was a bit slow not horrible,1
4334,i made the reservation when i was told it was to cover incidentals,1
4335,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
4336,the one good thing i can say about this place,1
4337,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
4338,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
4339,the hotel was in a bad area not horrible and the hotel room was a little better but there was a leak in our room,1
4340,thankfully they gave me another room to use the restroom which is at the end of my stay for the upgrade,1
4341,there were no towels there were stains on the wall and when i went to use it it fell off,1
4342,i would never recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort,1
4343,guess i need to use the swipe card,1
4344,we did not feel safe in the area,1
4345,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
4346,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
4347,they sent up maintenance to the room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
4348,we would have cancelled that night but it was too late to do anything about it,1
4349,reeks of smoke throughout the entire hotel except for the front desk to complain they were unsympathetic and said they had nothing else available,1
4350,the room was as friggen cold as a meat locker no there was no heat in the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
4351,so now we are in the process of closing the front office,1
4352,the walls are paper thin and there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
4353,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't stay in the room also didn't work,1
4354,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated in 50 yrs,1
4355,while waiting a man came in to leave furious because there was blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
4356,if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
4357,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
4358,not enough outlets to plug anything in so don't plan on staying in the hotel it's ok,1
4359,i called the front desk they said that there was a 250 charge on my credit card,1
4360,the first 2 rooms they gave us smelled of cat urine there was no toilet seat there was holes in the furniture,1
4361,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway,1
4362,there was an iron left on the floor overnight were damp in the morning,1
4363,finally there was a skunk at the front door which made me wonder what was going on and the,1
4364,their idea of a continental breakfast was a danish and an apple,1
4365,we booked one night because of the location and the other was price,1
4366,i feel completely disgusted since i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
4367,the hotel itself was very clean and well-kept,1
4368,i never stayed at the hotel this past weekend with the family and be able to go swimming,1
4369,first of all there was power outage by the time we came back to the room to show us how to operate the tv,1
4370,breakfast was horrible old apple juice and orange was no good,1
4371,all 5 of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price and this was the dirtiest hampton inn i have ever seen,1
4372,there was construction being done on the outside of the motel is okay but the room is pretty basic,1
4373,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
4374,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
4375,granted it is 4:30am in the morning but coffee was spot on,1
4376,even considering never to stay in a place like this can actually operate like this,1
4377,guess i need to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1
4378,i don't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
4379,the carpet was dirty and not maintained,1
4380,when we asked to talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
4381,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking,1
4382,they were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we were supposed to stay at the el cortez,1
4383,there was a wad of hair on the floor and fingerprints on mirrors,1
4384,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time,1
4385,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not leave the message for it,1
4386,upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the a couple beds some human some dog,1
4387,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
4388,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
4389,i got angry and then he said i didn't need them it was of no concern,1
4390,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
4391,she said she hated cigarette smoke and that the room would be like but it was very clean and nice,1
4392,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price charged and i would not stay here again,1
4393,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know if i hit the proprietor on a,1
4394,then he put me on hold and came back to the room to show us how to operate the tv,1
4395,this resort claimed to be a ski-in ski-out which was important to me,1
4396,dirty room with cokroch in bed hair all over the bathroom like it had not been used in many years and like smoke,1
4397,everywhere what is pg going to do this is to list all of the issues we had,1
4398,stayed here before and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
4399,i made the reservation and we couldn't get to mobile until late,1
4400,we would have asked for a different room at early check in and was told it was not available in the pool area,1
4401,the lobby was being used for drug deals,1
4402,we called the front desk and we had to put on the bed,1
4403,i will never stay there again and can not recommend it,1
4404,this property is a horrible location in the middle of the bed big dent,1
4405,when i went to checkout i had to wait for a hour to get someone to come by,1
4406,just needed a place to stay for the night but i hd no choice we were very tired,1
4407,i called back and the front desk person didn't try to help the situation at all,1
4408,air conditioner did not work properly there were no towels and when,1
4409,the rooms did not match the pictures on the internet are very deceiving,1
4410,this time when we checked in the front desk did not leave the message for it,1
4411,we had to keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
4412,the room smelled the air didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
4413,with this i felt like the room was not cleaned or given fresh towels,1
4414,stay away ppl worst hotel i've stayed at a lot of marriott's and this was my worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
4415,the manager of the hotel was a workzone,1
4416,don't know if this is because the hotel is old and dirty in the room the water wouldn't work in the next room,1
4417,the front desk staff said we were unable to open the balcony and the facility did not look like they have ever been upgraded,1
4418,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
4419,the walk way up to the room smelled like raw sewage when i asked the owner he told me he has,1
4420,needless to say i am never going to stay there again on our same business trip,1
4421,the hotel offered me a different room which i accepted but when i checked in they wanted to charge me 76,1
4422,all we wanted was a place to put my head,1
4423,the service provided by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for the lack of peace and service,1
4424,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
4425,no one would talk to us and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid for,1
4426,the room was tiny and the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
4427,there was nonfunctional iron the room smelled like urine but the smell was atrocious,1
4428,not enough towels and the front desk did not leave the message for it,1
4429,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
4430,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet chair and the floor of the bathroom,1
4431,but other than that this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
4432,and that was not all the curtains in the room were in poor condition it also had a musty smell,1
4433,of course that didn't change the fact that the only way to enter was through the front door the next day,1
4434,the front desk staff said we were unable to open the balcony and the facility did not look like they have ever been upgraded,1
4435,the first room tv did not work until it had to be the worst hotel i've ever stayed in ever,1
4436,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it was unused for a year or more,1
4437,they quoted us one rate and changed it when we checked out we didn't even eat it,1
4438,we had an issue and spoke to the front desk and they did send a repair man right over,1
4439,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not refund my money and that it is not that far from there,1
4440,it was the worst hotel i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
4441,the lobby and hallways had a strong odor and the sheets were worn thin,1
4442,the towels and bedding smelled like they had not cleaned in a while burned sheets ect,1
4443,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
4444,i went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
4445,not a very good location and the service staff was very friendly and apologetic hotel put 700,1
4446,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff was unprofessional with my grandson who is a minor,1
4447,i am a gm at a hotel in my life i stay on the road a,1
4448,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
4449,i booked this room for one of my two rooms and had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
4450,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
4451,i arrived at 10:30 at night and did not have any rooms available in a king size that i had booked,1
4452,it's my policy to never stay at a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great time there,1
4453,this was very clean but other than that this hotel was a disappointment,1
4454,i did not and will not recommend it to others due to false advertising of rooms and space,1
4455,went down to the front desk and the phone did not work in the room and hair on the bathroom floor,1
4456,my new room was also dirty and there was a bit of a take it or leave it attitude from the hosts,1
4457,there was accumulated dust all around the room and when i turned the sheets back it was clear that they were not clean,1
4458,the safe in the room was enough to make me want to stay there period but my girls were so exhausted we all were,1
4459,the inside lock on our room door was broken and the floors were so dirty and gross i never took my shoes off,1
4460,i will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1

4462,eat lunch on the 8th floor is atrocious,1
4463,she did not tell me till the next morning i had the same issue with someone else,1
4464,we came here and ask that they don't even tend to the room each day,1
4465,i would not stay at this hotel the place is run down old furniture not a very clean place,1
4466,the only clean thing about this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1

4482,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1

4484,first i was given a room that was booked within 3 minutes of the first,1
4485,cigarette burns on blanket in a nonsmoking room and the room wasn't too clean so only after a couple of hours,1

4489,when i talked to the front desk and requested housekeeping to come clean it,1
4490,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1

4540,checked in and 15 min later was on the phone the whole time to be guided what to do,1
4541,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
4542,i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
4543,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and a dead lady bug on the bed,1
4544,there were hairs in the shower when we got there they told us they had to leave,1

4551,swimming pool was very cold so i went back to the desk and the attendant gave me another room,1
4552,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
4553,they tell you one thing on the phone and didn't have anything it said it should,1
4554,we walk into our room and i was told he couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
4555,the tv did not want to be disturbed,1
4556,air conditioner didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1

4558,we would have cancelled that night but it was too late for us to find another hotel,1
4559,the room was dirty and the floor was dirty and the shower walls had visible dirt,1
4560,stay far away from this hotel if you have another choice,1
4561,i had to call the hotel to get a good night sleep,1
4562,incorrectly charged my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room and the fireplace,1
4563,did not know i was suppose to stay for 1 week,1
4564,then he put me on hold and came back to the room and they could not fix the problem,1
4565,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
4566,fortunately the room a c did work well and the breakfast was decent,1
4567,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
4568,only good thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
4569,there were black and brown stains all over the walls in different areas of the room,1
4570,they had a wedding that we didn't even eat it,1
4571,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
4572,worker loudly chatting on phone and sitting at table whole time i was there because i was on a budget,1
4573,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care about my situation will never stay there again,1
4574,we stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
4575,when we arrived to check in we asked for a room with 4 people,1
4576,we were moved out of the room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
4577,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel with a very lodge-like feel,1
4578,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
4579,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
4580,no coffee makers in the rooms and the hotel overall are extremely dated and in need of repair,1
4581,arrive at the hotel and was told that it was not very costly but i would have been assuaged,1
4582,very disorganized at the front desk was awful,1
4583,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
4584,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
4585,the furniture in the room old and dated,1
4586,we arrived about midnight to find that the room was a nice size and quiet,1
4587,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the poorest experiences i've had,1
4588,changed our plans and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
4589,to make matters worst there were roaches in the room the pull out couch was not a pull out,1
4590,hard to get in and out of our room by the hotel claiming it wasn't paid for,1
4591,this was my first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
4592,there were hookers and crack heads staying there and wandering in the parking lot broke down car in lot as well,1
4593,arriving back at my room at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
4594,guess they were not happy with our stay,1
4595,terrible customer service they failed to clean the room or make the bed or change the sheets,1
4596,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
4597,the sheets on the bed looked like they hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
4598,if i wanted to stay in that kind of environment,1
4599,front desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
4600,i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to see what i would find under the comforter,1
4601,the hotel was going under renovation while we were there we had to call and have the dishes brought up to our room,1
4602,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
4603,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia,1
4604,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
4605,worst part is i'm pregnant and the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallways,1
4606,i had ants in my room and it was a great view of santana row,1
4607,when i complained the customer service rep lied to me and said talk to the hand,1
4608,she doesn't give you a lot of money if you come early,1
4609,i use a wheelchair and there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
4610,was very dirty the only good thing about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
4611,i'm my room the bathroom door did not shut all of the way and it wasn't really separated,1
4612,the ad online stated it was next to the unit was literally shacking,1
4613,the first room i checked into had a bad smell and everything was stained drapes bedding and furniture,1
4614,prior to checking in i called the front desk from our cell phone,1
4615,we should have known something was wrong when we entered the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
4616,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
4617,website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was ok before he checked us in,1
4618,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
4619,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
4620,the manager argued with me regarding the claim of smoking in the room they charge you a lot of money if you come early,1
4621,finally went to the front and asked if they would comp the price of the room for 5 minutes,1
4622,they didn't have the rooms we booked were not even available,1
4623,we checked out and went to another hotel but i couldn't get my money back because of bed bugs,1
4624,view more me out of sleep and when i looked at the pictures from the internet versus real life,1
4625,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever stayed,1
4626,they also did not disclose that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
4627,they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
4628,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything she could do about it,1
4629,i asked 2 times towels and heck the ac is not working they never came to fix it they just removed it,1
4630,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1

4646,when we walked in the room and when i turned down the covers there were hairs from the pubis on the sheets,1
4647,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
4648,i stayed at the country inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1

4650,we arrived about midnight to find that the room was never clean,1
4651,we will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and loved our room and location of the hotel,1
4652,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to search for another one in the middle of the night scaring my family,1
4653,we went into the room the room was extremely hot so we called the front desk the next morning was much more hospitable,1
4654,50 in 1972 is about the going rate for the quality of the hotel,1
4655,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1

4665,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
4666,the the second room had dead pill bugs on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
4667,we came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub i was not comfortable with that at all,1
4668,bed like sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
4669,guess i need to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1
4670,no heat in the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
4671,the walls only went half way and it was just exceptional so we sought out another hampton inn along our trip,1
4672,the place is huge well maintained from outside and right next to the front desk and they gave me a new set,1
4673,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
4674,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1

4682,i did not feel safe and the condition of the hotel was filthy and smelled real bad,1
4683,the only good thing about this hotel was the free airport shuttle,1

4685,the room was oaky but i will never stay in this days inn again,1
4686,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1

4699,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
4700,as we entered into he entrance in the back of the door looked like it had been kicked open,1
4701,we also had trouble with payment which we had to use to get to our room,1
4702,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites is not an inn nor suite,1
4703,i called the hotel they were not very good at housekeeping,1
4704,i will never stay there again and can not recommend it,1
4705,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
4706,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through a wall of water pouring through the ceiling,1
4707,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional,1
4708,every area of the hotel i decided to look under the sheets on the bed were not clean,1
4709,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
4710,best i could do was put a chair in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls ceiling of bathroom,1

4718,glad i didn't have any smoking rooms left but when i got to the pool he was gone,1
4719,also the floors sounded like they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
4720,on the positive side the bed was comfortable but you can hear,1
4721,the guest service was very rude at check-in was not allowed until 3 pm,1

4723,dirty dishes and the hall entering the room was so small that the luggage cart couldn't even fit in,1
4724,didn't have another room to move us to another room on the first floor and the lobby smelled really musty,1

4739,when i told the receptionist i didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me,1
4740,staff was apologetic and kind but i will never return to this place,1

4764,at least the hotel staff was having a potluck when we arrived and the a c was not on in the room,1
4765,when i tried to check in at 5:30pm,1
4766,they don't inform you about this problem before and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
4767,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but the hotel was full of cockroaches,1
4768,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
4769,and the carpet has cigarettes burn even though we were in a construction zone walls were unfinished taping everywhere floors undone,1
4770,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a better location or better motel hotel,1
4771,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is not as pictured online and were actually much older,1
4772,the towels were paper thin and there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week,1
4773,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
4774,even considering never to stay in a room with no amenities,1
4775,at a glance the room also seemed clean it had a bit of a commotion outside the door and he walked right in,1
4776,the reservation was wrong and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
4777,we're working on trying to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
4778,we called the front desk and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
4779,the outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out,1
4780,we arrive on 4 16 15 and the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
4781,the ladies at the front desk was great,1
4782,note that my room was non smoking but had burn marks in the carpet dirty trim and windows,1
4783,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
4784,complimentary breakfast was good and well stocked throughout our stay and the price was right and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
4785,we cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
4786,we opened the door and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
4787,so for two nights we had no tv remote in the room the a c leaking inside the room and decided i could not stay,1
4788,we tried to leave and we were told we would not have looked there,1
4789,i called customer service from the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
4790,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
4791,it's a hole that i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
4792,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
4793,she did not tell me till the next morning i mentioned the room was not clean had bad odor and carpet was severely stained,1
4794,we moved to another room the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
4795,we tried to leave and we were told to go find a table,1
4796,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
4797,the rugs are dirty and when we took a shower the towel ripped while he was drying himself off,1
4798,the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked up in the hallway,1
4799,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
4800,i made a reservation for a non smoking room walked in it smelled like smoke,1
4801,my car was broken into in the front of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
4802,staff stole 4 000 out of our room on day 2 the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
4803,the young man at the front desk and they gave me a new room,1
4804,when i got to the room he opened the door and we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room,1
4805,the room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
4806,the hotel was very dirty our rooms were filthy as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen,1
4807,when i got in the room the windows were open and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1
4808,when i have a reservation for a 3 day stay at this hotel tge last 2 nights,1
4809,the towels have holes in them so you can see what i mean when you're there,1
4810,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and they gave our room to them,1
4811,living room had no light and the smell of smoke with chemicals and other things,1
4812,came in at midnight cause of a late flight got to the front desk they said someone would come look at it nobody showed up,1
4813,holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
4814,room 1013 lighting issues broken lamp tv did not function properly in fact the deadbolt did not work,1
4815,as a travel agent owner of cruiseone erik fischer associates i would have to leave then and she got an attitude with me,1
4816,so bad experienced it was soo dirt and had roches on the bed and there were a few small holes also,1
4817,the room was filthy and in disrepair staff was rude and the rooms were outdated,1
4818,the last straw was that the room had a mini fridge but no drinking glasses of any kind,1
4819,our friends had a room that smelled terrible and had to move rooms and even then there was no peace,1
4820,the hotel smells like mold the staff was not helpful the manager wasn't accommodating at all,1
4821,the towels were paper thin and there was no hot water for a shower,1
4822,there were black and brown stains all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience,1
4823,the outside door wouldn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of august you need the ac,1
4824,one of the worst if not the worst hotel but not the best,1
4825,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time,1
4826,so we immediately went back to the lady at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
4827,if you frequent hostels and don't have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
4828,one bed had only one pillow no blankets on the beds and the rooms were not very clean,1
4829,we did go ask the manager but she said she had to pay the maid to clean the room again,1
4830,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk had an nasty attitude when i inquired about the reservations,1
4831,i will never stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
4832,but it was okay and was a room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
4833,this was the worst hotel we have stayed in many laquintas and have always been satisfied but this one was filthy,1
4834,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
4835,got a rude awakening at 4 am when the fire alarm went off 4 times in one night 10:00pm until about 9:00am,1
4836,the carpet was atrocious and when i went to the front desk once to quiet down a party next door,1
4837,i have booked many hotels and never had a problem this is the worst hotel that i have ever had in my life,1
4838,cons walls are paper thin and there were stains on the sheets pillos and carpet,1
4839,the hotel location is probably the only good thing was the free popcorn at night,1
4840,carpet has not been vacuumed in a week and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways,1
4841,i want to let everyone know that it is not that far from there,1
4842,we had our family reunion there and it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them,1
4843,our room was on the side opposite from the front desk to ask for another room and the hotel told me they had none,1
4844,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
4845,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
4846,i left crying and i will never recommend either you or holiday inn,1
4847,i booked a room at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
4848,our friends we were traveling with a group of senior citizens,1
4849,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
4850,it didn't appear any construction was going on in the parking lot in full view of the office,1
4851,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk were very nice and tried to help as much as possible,1
4852,the only piece of furniture in the room old and dated,1
4853,buyer beware they charged my card after i made the reservation when i was told it was on the beach,1
4854,i would never return or recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car,1
4855,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the front deck,1
4856,when they discovered their mistake there wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
4857,this place should be torn down and rebuilt,1
4858,and i have a hard time with the check in,1
4859,i felt like i was in clean hotel when it came to the room to show us how to operate the tv,1
4860,when we pulled in to the parking lot and yell at our group,1
4861,the walk way on the third floor below a giant,1
4862,we arrived and was caught of guard when the lady at front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke,1
4863,r r had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and one under a table in the room,1
4864,the hotel was dirty i am not sure why in the morning it was parked in by an 18 wheeler,1
4865,this was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room it was musty and humid,1
4866,the sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and the room smelled worse,1
4867,had an attitude like she didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
4868,when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there were black flying bugs in the bathroom,1
4869,she was very nice professional and acknowledged that it was a huge waste of our money,1
4870,i advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they were sold out i was stuck,1
4871,there were fights happening in the parking lot were dead rodents,1
4872,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
4873,i ask for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk were very pleasant and helpful,1
4874,my wife checked the credit card and the company said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean,1
4875,the pool and spa were dirty and needed a good vacuum and cleaning,1
4876,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was non smoking i think that just for the 3 nights i was there,1
4877,we were told that they were pet friendly,1
4878,unfortunately it was not the worst hotel experience of my life,1
4879,room was small dirty and it smelled like gas from the stove,1
4880,and also i made a 44 second phone call and next to the bed and next to the phone,1
4881,tried another stay this time i couldn't wait to check in and heard the whole conversation,1
4882,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
4883,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
4884,we had our family reunion there and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
4885,my boyfriend and i stayed here for a funeral with my sisters,1
4886,first of all the man at the front desk couldn't find my reservation,1
4887,tired i decided to stay at this again,1
4888,the tub was so bad that there was no one else in the lobby,1

4891,they could not find my rsvp and my room was at the end of june 2016,1
4892,since it was late we could not get another room until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
4893,we booked one night because of the location and the other was price,1
4894,took us 9 months and hundreds of dollars to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
4895,the handle on the door was broken too,1
4896,the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and nasty to me for no reason,1
4897,upon arrival the reservations were screwed up and instead of two rooms we were informed that they cancelled our reservation and had no rooms available,1
4898,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
4899,needless to say i couldn't wait to check in and get to the elevator,1
4900,in general the customer service was horrible there was a stink bug problem,1
4901,we needed an inexpensive place to stay for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
4902,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1

4906,there was an iron left on the floor overnight were damp in the morning,1
4907,this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
4908,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1

4916,woke up to no hot water for an early morning shower,1
4917,the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
4918,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
4919,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
4920,there was old body fluids on the floor at the end of our vacation we wanted to pay with cash rather than cards,1
4921,the rates were exceptional and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
4922,when we got there they told us they didnt offer it anymore,1
4923,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1

4929,room was nothing like the pictures they have,1
4930,i requested 2 beds when we got to the room i understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray,1
4931,my desk chair had a film on it and the carpet was dirty as was the bedspread,1
4932,i finally attempted to use the shower and the tub would take forever to drain,1
4933,lobby reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and stained,1
4934,i called this hotel directly and they said they had none to move us too,1
4935,i would never stay there again please if you are a somewhat savvy traveler of large metropolitan cities,1
4936,this was by far one of the worst hotel i've stayed at,1
4937,manager came in at 6 am when i asked for a manager to contact me but no one called,1
4938,no heat on friday and no do not disturb sign on the door when we entered,1

4941,this is the part of the staff here,1
4942,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were getting the rooms cleaned,1
4943,but no the state of the room did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
4944,i booked 2 nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1

4952,our room smelled musty from the moment we opened the door to the room was broken and did not shut properly,1
4953,ac in rooms blasting so loud that my bed that was next to the airport but wasn't very clean either,1

4956,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
4957,bathroom in the room wasn't cleaned,1
4958,so we stayed on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
4959,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
4960,i called a few weeks ahead of our stay to check on the reservation and they refused to give me one because i booked online,1
4961,room was not worth the money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
4962,the blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was supposly a non smoking room floor and the entire hotel smelled very bad,1
4963,after about 2 hours hotel staff told us they had already sold the room and probably did,1
4964,the hotel had no room service menu in the room and the front window was open,1
4965,the beds were hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
4966,called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
4967,again if it wasn't for the fact that breakfast was continental not full and the rooms were uncomfortable,1
4968,the next day i contacted hotels and they told me of course housekeeping didn't find anything so,1
4969,eat lunch on the 8th floor is atrocious,1
4970,we normally love aston aloha and were very sad that we could not stay with our cats dogs were ok but cats were not allowed,1
4971,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1
4972,the reservation was wrong and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
4973,the front desk is vacant most of the time and can honstly say i've never stayed ina more depressing facility,1
4974,the hotel reservation said it was a great view of santana row,1
4975,guess they were not happy with our stay here,1
4976,however the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was not much better,1
4977,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
4978,the walls are paper thin it sounded like the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
4979,we walk into our room and that was the only reason we booked with them,1
4980,the comforter had a huge brown smelly spot on it and the carpet was old and dirty,1
4981,when i returned to the hotel after the funeral and found the room had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
4982,the room was oaky but i will never stay here again or reccommend to a friend,1
4983,room had a stench and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1

4985,we came upstairs to look at the complaint of the customer,1
4986,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
4987,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
4988,i would not recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car next time before booking this dump,1
4989,this was the worst place i have ever been in,1
4990,there was no coffee before the 7 am brunch and that the sign was wrong and that no one smokes in that room any more,1
4991,there are no ice machines at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
4992,i asked her why you don't have a problem with that kind of maintenance,1
4993,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
4994,front desk was very rude and their towels were like sand paper i would not recommend this place to my enemies,1
4995,i can honestly say this is probably the filthiest hotel i have ever been,1
4996,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and they gave our room away,1
4997,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a much better hotel,1
4998,will not stay at the hotel because of the location and the other was price,1
4999,the bathtub did not drain and on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
5000,i would never stay there again please if you are a somewhat savvy traveler of large metropolitan cities,1
5001,this was the most horrible hotel i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
5002,after finally getting to the room it's very outdated,1
5003,my wife has a bad knee and we had to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
5004,tried another stay this time i couldn't wait to get out in the morning,1
5005,i was very unhappy with the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
5006,bad place overall even if you don't mind screaming neighbors plentiful marijuana smoke and broken elevators,1
5007,the management told me that there was no one at the desk,1
5008,the lady in front of me was getting her money back because of the no refund thing,1
5009,i have stayed at kimpton hotels often and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1
5010,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
5011,on the first day refrigerator was not working but they did not go low enough to block the light,1
5012,we felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay at this hotel it's disgusting in every sense,1
5013,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
5014,and when i mentioned we had no tv remote control in the room was in much need of updating,1
5015,we took the food out cleaned the microwave but the smell was not coming from the bathroom,1
5016,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room and then she gave us a deluxe king bed room,1
5017,after i checked in i was given a handicap room that i didn't have a working ac,1
5018,instead of remodeling this hotel should be shut down and demolished,1
5019,sheets were not clean on one of the beds sank in the middle,1
5020,first off we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
5021,after staying last year we were offered a different room but no changes were made,1
5022,it was half the price of most hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
5023,to top it off we went in the room was old the towels and bed sheets,1
5024,this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of months ahead a get away for my husbands birthday,1
5025,when i got to the hotel they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website,1
5026,the room smelled terrible and the non-smoking room smelled of smoke that had,1
5027,non-smoking room but the entire first floor was under construction,1
5028,after we complained we were put in a room the first night where construction was going on in the parking lot,1
5029,i had requested a non-smoking room on the website,1
5030,the hotel was clean and comfortable but for the price we paid even a worse value than it already was,1
5031,crossing the border from canada we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
5032,the room was dingy and unclean and the bed was very comfortable although i'm not a fan of dirty,1
5033,wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
5034,so many things were wrong here i don't even smoke and after i was one of the worst hotels i have ever visited,1
5035,the ice machine was out of order basketball hoop broke,1
5036,the hotel was very dirty our rooms were filthy as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
5037,almost seemed liked the rule was you couldn't stay at this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
5038,but summary of this review is i wouldn't stay here again if they paid me,1
5039,the room smelled the air didn't work and neither did the phone,1
5040,went to tell front desk and was told about the problem,1
5041,we left and will never stay their agin,1
5042,note that my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back,1
5043,my husband and i stayed at the country inn and suites is now under new owners,1
5044,first off we were given a new set to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
5045,lol then he offered us another room and they told us there were none available,1
5046,i feel completely disgusted since i went to the desk but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
5047,the room had a bad odor and the air conditioning was in the living area and the ice machine in the hall doesn't work,1
5048,the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
5049,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and on toilet seat,1
5050,i arrived late looking for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
5051,when checking in were told we couldn't receive a refund,1
5052,i do not recommend anyone to stay here,1
5053,motwani was hard to find i didn't get apologies for the disaster,1
5054,worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
5055,the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and short,1
5056,there was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in no one was at the front desk was obviously there just doing her job,1
5057,first of all there was power outage by the time we came back to the room they were back in full effect,1
5058,for the price that i paid for the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies,1
5059,the overall condition of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1

5073,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
5074,the bed was not comfortable this hotel needs to be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
5075,and totally useless as an attempt to call front desk and picked up phone filthy,1

5077,it wasvery obvious there had been water damage and someone poked a hole in the wall place,1
5078,they said they have no other room and when we arrived there was urine in the toilet,1
5079,a horrible hotel i will not recommend this motel to anyone,1
5080,obviously picked this place because it was cheap but wish i would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway,1
5081,the room had dead bees and flies in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby arguing with an attendant,1
5082,they simply wrote down your room number and you had to leave the pool to get away from the toxic chlorine levels,1
5083,hotel staff didn't seem to care about my situation will never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back,1

5092,possibly the smokiest hotel room i've ever stayed in ever,1
5093,the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was moldy throughout,1

5143,i will never stay at this hotel the same nights,1
5144,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
5145,needless to say we checked out a day early and upgraded to the motel 6 next door,1
5146,we only stayed one night and switched hotels,1
5147,the door across from our room looked like it has not been updated in years,1

5155,we informed staff but there were no other rooms available we would've left,1
5156,i understand there was a wrestling tournament and there is a bad smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
5157,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to wait to check in and get to the elevator,1
5158,elevator was broken and i will not recommend this hotel unless you want to experience bed bugs and a filthy bathtub,1
5159,we informed staff but there were no other rooms available we would've left,1
5160,they figured cause i was from out of town it was long distance,1

5190,i ended up here because there were no other rooms to switch to,1

5227,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and nice,1
5228,this hotel is outdated and in need of repair and it was very nice,1
5229,i am almost certain this happened in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
5230,i would never stay there or recommend this place to in-laws that i hate,1
5231,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst experience i have ever had,1
5232,then to top it all off they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,1
5233,probably didn't help that there was a no refund policy,1
5234,it was so bad that there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
5235,i took pics of roaches blood on the wall and when i went to the hampton inn across the street,1
5236,i will never ever stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone,1

5244,the guy that booked over the phone i would be able to assist,1
5245,i couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for the remainder of our stay,1
5246,wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
5247,the place is nothing like the pictures they have,1
5248,i will not be staying at this hotel the same nights,1
5249,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair on them,1
5250,you can complainant to any patel or desai this was not a good experience and it was my 40th birthday,1
5251,when we first arrived i thought the smell in the room was old and wore out,1
5252,well the next day we slept in the car and was more comfortable,1
5253,when we returned the next night we opened the door to the room was broken and did not shut properly,1
5254,smelling that dampness in the room for only 2 hours and didn't try to help the situation at all,1
5255,we had to take it as it was the only place that had an opening near oxford,1
5256,cheap rates but not worth it because we had to pay a hotel for our five day stay,1
5257,i did inquire if the room was grimy and reeked,1
5258,they don't inform you about this problem before and they don't care how it looks just wants your money,1
5259,i reserved for 6 nights because i was on the third floor and just looked run down,1
5260,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
5261,i'm appalled by this place and it scared them straight,1
5262,called corporate and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have any amenities as promised,1
5263,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room is when they gave me another room,1
5264,sorry didn't stay when we went to go look at the room,1
5265,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend or stay there ever again,1
5266,i called tuesday morning to speak with the owner who was nit there,1
5267,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
5268,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
5269,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1
5270,we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell until they remodel completely,1
5271,the food is the worst we had ever stayed in,1
5272,the only piece of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was filthy,1
5273,there were signs of disrepair in the hotel room and was completed and utterly disgusted,1
5274,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
5275,when we first checked in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
5276,we will not stay at this motel tell again if it was my last resort,1
5277,reeked of mildew parts of the room were very dirty and ripped,1
5278,we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in,1
5279,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
5280,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend this motel nor would i stay there again,1
5281,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name,1
5282,there was a big problem in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some,1
5283,all we wanted was a place to sleep this isn't even worth a one star,1
5284,she gave me a key to a different room,1
5285,the hotel manager at the super 8 motel in bradenton florida,1
5286,i had to get out of there fast enough,1
5287,and the alarm clock did not work properly there were no towels in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
5288,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
5289,the hallway odor of smoke while we pick non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room was never clean,1
5290,we check in and found that ac in room was not working correctly and still very hot at night,1
5291,we booked one night because of the conditions of the rooms or anything,1
5292,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk to checked us in they were too busy,1
5293,went to front desk again for towels they still didn't have clean linen i slept on top of them again,1
5294,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed,1
5295,and this was on a non-smoking room we entered,1
5296,request smoking received non smoking i will not recommend or stay here ever again,1
5297,view more me out of sleep and when i looked at the pictures from the web site it looked very nice,1
5298,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
5299,so we immediately went back to the desk and the attendant gave me another room,1
5300,people were standing outside of my room and they could not fix the problem,1
5301,unfortunately my stay was not pleasant we were put in another room the maid made sure mostly things were clean,1
5302,when we walked into the room it was horrific meaning that when me and my wife enough times to completely ruin our vacation,1
5303,i was looking for was a place to sleep this isn't even worth a one star,1
5304,our family arrived about 1030 or 11 pm on a friday night and paid significantly more money,1
5305,the last few times i have stayed here i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
5306,we had to book to another motel and had a hard time sleeping because we couldn't get a refund,1
5307,i was given a king room when i requested a non smoking room and room used to be a good one before this new owner,1
5308,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
5309,find a better hotel for the money you pay the breakfast is veryour poor,1
5310,i wouldn't be dissappointed if the room was the very strong oder,1
5311,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
5312,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non smoking room on a non smoking floor,1
5313,i called the front desk and they said the hotel had a strange odor in the lobby elevator hallway and room,1
5314,they had the nerves to ask for a room change and got one but that room had the same issue with someone else,1
5315,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
5316,room was beyond shabby beds did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
5317,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to look at the room to say it wasn't better,1
5318,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
5319,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
5320,so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room was worn out,1
5321,the telephone in our room did not work and i had to carry my luggage to the third floor to get to our room,1
5322,they couldn't do anything and i would need to contact the third-party booking site for it wasn't,1
5323,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk and no on ever came to the room to take care of,1
5324,the air conditioning didn't work in this one either,1
5325,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out,1
5326,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room each time i left,1
5327,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean and had standing water because the drain for it to escape wasnt working properly,1
5328,we saved for a very long time including the metal doors,1
5329,view more me out of sleep and when i looked at the pictures from the internet versus real life,1
5330,this was my first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had to stay in a hotel,1
5331,in addition numerous unaccompanied children played in the halls all hours of the day and night pretty sure it involved drugs,1
5332,the young man at the desk found the confirmation and said it was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
5333,when i went on line to search for hotels and i looked at each other and decided maybe we needed to do that,1
5334,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel with a very lodge-like feel,1
5335,i'm asking for my money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
5336,we walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
5337,every horizontal surface had cigarette burns on the comforters in a non-smoking,1
5338,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not want to take my shoes off in the room,1
5339,the ladies at the front desk was closed,1
5340,the room had a disgusting odor not sure if it the environment or the community,1
5341,the service was good at this hotel but i cut my stay short because i could not stand to sleep there,1
5342,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
5343,this was by far the worst hotel i've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues,1
5344,the cleanliness was lacking i lifted the toilet seat and there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
5345,this particular hotel is a disaster and used to be a smoking room and we are no smokers,1
5346,location this hotel is right in the middle of the night so we finally realized that this is a motel not a hotel or inn,1
5347,this was by far the worst hotel i ever been,1
5348,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a complaint on anything,1
5349,next day a man not sure if it the environment or the community,1
5350,i will be registering a complaint with the board of health should look into the cleanliness of this place,1
5351,the carpet was slimy sticky and there were stains on the sheets and didn't appear to care,1
5352,i took it to the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
5353,then we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
5354,i learned the morning after my stay when i went to check it out since 1st choice hotel was full,1
5355,well if we had a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed in addition to the room fee,1

5370,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
5371,but the good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
5372,we called back later to again try and get a refund and he said expedia hotels makes that decision and i should call them,1
5373,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1

5377,this was my first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had,1
5378,front desk was very unprofessional and did not want to work and the bed was like sleeping on the ground,1
5379,this was not the best experience the front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional,1
5380,then when she did she only checked me in for one of my workers they did not have that room available,1
5381,frankly it has been a week since we stayed at this hotel because it was close to glacier and had a family suite available,1
5382,thought i was renting a nice room for the night and came across this one thinking it wouldn't be that bad,1
5383,window didnt open air conditioner did not run properly 5,1

5413,called the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
5414,i ask for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
5415,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know if i hit the proprietor on a,1

5419,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find a room in an area with none,1
5420,was a cold night and the at the desk put us in a much cheaper smaller room than i had already paid,1
5421,we had to get 2 rooms because we have a family member in icu at fmh across from the hotel,1
5422,however we did get a non-smoking room we entered,1
5423,upon entering my room there were large holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
5424,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
5425,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
5426,so i called the front desk and they never fixed it,1
5427,after we complained we were put in a room with no amenities,1
5428,the staff were rude and acted like they didn't have it worst hotel i've stayed at,1

5441,i will never stay at this hotel and i've definitely started in better places for lower prices,1
5442,overall we were very disappointed with our stay at the motel was simply unbelievable,1
5443,i don't think i'll be back later since i'm house hunting,1
5444,the lobby is a lovely area and the front desk staff who were very friendly and helpful,1
5445,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
5446,there were dead spiders bugs all over the bathroom ceiling the broken showerhead or the bloody sheets,1
5447,when we returned to our room after the first night because of the location and the comfort inn brand,1
5448,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
5449,it was horrendous i would not recommend this hotel my wife had to go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
5450,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it,1
5451,i also noticed that there was a no refund policy,1
5452,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
5453,i started the shower and while the water didn't look bad but then we got to our room,1

5458,we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
5459,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
5460,i was not the only one to complain about the towels i couldn't even call,1
5461,first one didn't lock second didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man,1
5462,opening the door of our non-smoking room we entered,1
5463,i did not stay there because i was on the top floor and the furthest from the elevator,1
5464,the people at the front desk had no idea what it was like,1
5465,the resort itself was very nice and quickly move me to another room with two beds,1
5466,i never spoke to the manager when i went to the desk but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
5467,even though we had a non-smoking room but the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and mildew,1
5468,after two more tries we contacted the front desk and they told me the smaller charge was a mistake by the hotel staff,1
5469,it was not what i booked or paid for and there was no gravy and a half of biscuit on display folks not cool,1
5470,the breakfast was terrible and on top of that i could not get my money back,1
5471,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
5472,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were not clean at all for the price i expected better,1
5473,we had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
5474,i informed him about what happened and he said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call,1
5475,all the reason we will not stay at another red roof inn,1

5495,woke up to no hot water for our entire stay,1
5496,the rooms were dirty the sofa in my room had dirty linen on the bed which was completely made up,1
5497,we should have read the reviews before booking and thought it couldn't be that bad even though the rate was very reasonable,1
5498,when we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask for a deposit shoot they should have been cleaning our room,1
5499,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1

5513,the hotel was adequate but the room smelled like urine the second we walked in,1

5515,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
5516,it was a view of trees and the parking lot had ripped out carper laying by the entrance,1
5517,this is the part of the staff here,1
5518,they put ear plugs in the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
5519,i would not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
5520,needless to say my friend and i and we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1
5521,the smell of smoke was so strong we knew we would not be checking into the hotel,1
5522,t-v controls did not work properly room was dusty,1
5523,but we got no sleep cause they put us on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
5524,i stay at hampton inn's all the time and this was the worst hotel i've ever been in,1
5525,no towels broken locks smells like smoke in a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
5526,i went back down to the desk and told here we couldn't stay after the first night i cancelled everything and moved elsewhere,1
5527,however the room was a nice size and quiet,1
5528,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
5529,when i booked i asked about it and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
5530,our room was dirty mildew in the tub and a shower door that came off the track,1
5531,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
5532,i don't recommend it to my worst enemy,1
5533,the first room we had did not have a screen and would not lock the bed was hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible,1
5534,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
5535,i walked up the stairs and opened the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
5536,the breakfast was ok if you didn't want to catch any diseases,1
5537,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to know where to put us,1
5538,needless to say we checked out a day before i did not feel very safe,1
5539,the hotel double booked so when i got back not only did they not fix the problem,1
5540,they offered me a rubber door stop sadly i have been traveling around the country for almost two months now,1
5541,but when i went back to look at it at 10 the next day,1
5542,the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
5543,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
5544,horrible sounds because of the airport and there is no elevator to the second floor had loose wobbly steps,1
5545,when we went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
5546,i called the front desk from my cell phone from a gentleman representing quality inn stating that i had reserved online,1
5547,also the floors sounded like they were going to send house keeping right up that never happened,1
5548,i will say the room was clean even though we had one in the previous room,1
5549,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and say he fixed it after check out,1
5550,i wanted to sleep in my sleeping bag,1
5551,i booked a room with 2 double beds or a room with a sofa bed i confirmed it on line,1
5552,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach it was not worth the price,1
5553,walls are paper thin and there were stains on the comforter the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it,1
5554,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and crawling in the bathroom,1
5555,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
5556,we noticed an ant on the bed the towels and the bathroom was clean,1
5557,00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms,1
5558,all 5 of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price and this was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i,1
5559,so sad to have to pay for the full time and i said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,1
5560,and the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on bed smelled like dog,1
5561,when i walked in the room we decided to leave,1
5562,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty,1
5563,the tub was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there wife and kids ages 3,1
5564,buyer beware they charged my card after i made the reservation and we couldn't even use it,1
5565,for this establishment to give the name of fiesta inn and suites and would not return even if i was paid,1
5566,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
5567,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
5568,bathtub was disgusting could not take a shower till morning,1
5569,one common bathroom for the whole floor on the 2nd floor and about the size of a closet,1
5570,my 17 year old son an i arrived at the hotel after 10 hours traveling and i was really exhausted,1
5571,when i got there the rooms were in terrible shape by far the worst place i have ever stayed at,1
5572,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one set we had two rooms,1
5573,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
5574,i didn't feel safe in the surroundings,1
5575,not really in a good neighborhood didn't feel safe for myself or my automobile,1
5576,the air-conditioning did not work all that well,1
5577,as we drove around the hotel to where our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room,1
5578,the airport shuttle which was one of the worst hotels i have ever been in,1
5579,we had a problem with my room and spoke to the front desk for issues the girl working the front desk,1
5580,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls did not match,1
5581,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have any clean ones readily available,1
5582,the clerk was not pleasant and put me a room that smelled terrible and had to move rooms and even then there was no peace,1
5583,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
5584,they were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we were supposed to stay at the holidays,1
5585,i was forced to take late at night after match versus staying there another night,1
5586,they moved to the hot tub and the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it,1
5587,again we were not sure if the smoke was coming from another room but it was so much trouble it was an inconvenience,1
5588,this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
5589,they cleaned the bathroom but never replaced the sheets on the bed the first day but didn't thing anything of it,1
5590,they didn't have a bulb to replace it until the next day we look at our account and they charged our card,1
5591,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was no water to drink anywhere in the hotel except out of,1
5592,the entire experience was bad and we would never stay here again and it should not even be listed on expedia,1
5593,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
5594,i went to the office and told the manager and she said she understood and there would be no charge for late cancellation,1
5595,it was not even worth the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
5596,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
5597,that had to be the worst hotel i've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues,1
5598,i booked a room through expedia-not a good experience and it was my 40th birthday,1
5599,the the second room had dead pill bugs on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
5600,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
5601,i was so scared to relax or to go to bed at 10 30 pm but the music next door,1
5602,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
5603,when we arrived to the room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
5604,only good thing i can say about this joint is that at least i didn't have a single craft beer,1
5605,carpet in the room needs a lot of work,1
5606,place needs a lot of repairs also i will never stay at or recommend extended stay,1
5607,non of the rooms match what was advertised on the check in counter,1
5608,there were holes in the frame where it looks like it hadn't been scrubbed in weeks,1
5609,we stayed in elko for one night to catch an early flight,1
5610,there was a big problem in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
5611,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
5612,00 dinner just for the holiday bad food bad service and on top of that had to deal with nonsense from an incompetent employee,1
5613,there are place around that are a lot better for comfortableness and cleanlyness,1
5614,i arrived at the hotel and said i would prefer a non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled strongly of cigarettes,1
5615,it's a hole that i was forced to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
5616,the paint in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
5617,likewise all of the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower,1
5618,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back and find my second room,1
5619,i stayed here the staff was very friendly and helpful,1
5620,they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
5621,we arrived late in the evening before thanksgiving,1
5622,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the lobby to get some they were declined,1
5623,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for my son graduation,1
5624,as other reviews have said the continental breakfast was a danish and an apple,1
5625,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
5626,we did not sleep well we both woke up in the middle of the bed big dent,1
5627,the lady at the front desk checking out,1
5628,we were there for the whole weekend and i asked for extra towels they would only give us 2 more,1
5629,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
5630,1 they gave me a new set,1
5631,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
5632,we checked in around 6:00pm and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
5633,needless to say we checked out a day before i did not feel safe in the surroundings,1
5634,there was no fridge in this room even though we had air conditioner appeared that was not working correctly,1
5635,the room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be biscuits and gravy,1
5636,the 3rd room had another smell we also discovered several bugs in the room and when i mentioned how he was rude to me,1
5637,i called back one more time and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
5638,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't booked on line i would have insisted on my money back,1
5639,i called back one more time and the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it,1
5640,i have stayed at this hotel for my son graduation,1
5641,cockroaches on my food in the microwave and i woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
5642,bathroom in the room was old and dated,1
5643,we checked out and went to another hotel in iowa city,1
5644,i will say the staff was very nice and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
5645,not completely horrible but the room had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
5646,this was the first time i've stayed here multiple times and blocked rooms for the entire team in the past,1
5647,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
5648,this is about the worse place i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
5649,was a cold night and the at the desk put us in a much cheaper smaller room than i had already paid,1
5650,the bathroom counter top was the only nice thing i can say about this place,1
5651,that asked us for our car info at the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude,1
5652,i don't have words because 2 weeks later and i am still waiting to receive credit back on my credit card,1
5653,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
5654,i arrived to find out that the safe in our room did not work and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub,1
5655,first of all do not leave a cash deposit 100 and a valid credit card to check inn,1
5656,i went down to the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
5657,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
5658,my advice only book this hotel if you have another choice,1
5659,the best part of this stay was the room was clean and the bed was very squeaky,1
5660,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
5661,as other reviews have said the continental breakfast was only cereal toast waffles coffee milk oj,1
5662,it was horrible right away when we walked in the staff was very peasant great stay for the price,1
5663,no one said anything when checking in to the room i knew it was not non-smoking,1
5664,i had to ask for a different room and was told it couldn't be slept in,1
5665,the one good thing i can say about this place,1
5666,i was even escorted by the police out of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1
5667,if i had not been exhausted and desperate for a room and it was impossible to sleep after 6 am,1
5668,1st night awakened by call from my cell phone to let them know i cant stay hete with my family,1
5669,in early october i called this hotel directly and they said they will call me back to solve the problem,1
5670,when we arrived to check in i noticed the front door carpet was dirty and stained but the sheets were clean,1
5671,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
5672,our walls and door looked like they had grease stains on them and when we asked them,1
5673,and this was on a non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of dog pet and had a very dirty musty feel,1
5674,the first room had nasty stains on the sheets and comforters and hair in the bathtub,1
5675,if this place were inspected there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
5676,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
5677,if it hadn't been cleaned properly,1
5678,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night long,1
5679,other than location this hotel should be taken off the list,1
5680,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
5681,to the point where i can't believe these can get away with this,1
5682,so i cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
5683,when we went in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
5684,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was almost dry,1
5685,i did inquire if the room was grimy and reeked,1
5686,this room had a used towel on the chair bed was not made again moved to another room,1
5687,we had to pack up and move to a different hotel across the street,1
5688,i would not stay here again and can not recommend it,1
5689,call the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they would comp the price of the room for 5 minutes,1
5690,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
5691,saw some ants in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get either dat that we stayed,1
5692,that is a problem because i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
5693,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
5694,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
5695,the room smelled as though the hotel was trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell and with no way to turn it off,1
5696,the hotel is falling apart and the staff is very rude and they lack customer service skills,1
5697,i called back and the assistant manager picked up and said oh yes mr,1
5698,i went to the front desk as i was in a newly renovated room,1
5699,one of the downstairs doors to get in the hotel doesn't have many stores or food places nearby,1
5700,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the cofee reservoir was dirty there was hair on the pillow of my daughter bed,1
5701,when we booked the hotel it said it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
5702,casino was fine but i will never go there again,1
5703,the rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke,1
5704,the guy at the front desk could not find my rsvp and my room was switched twice,1
5705,well 4:30 am arrives and the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it,1
5706,it is not worth the time or money to stay at a super 8,1
5707,the location of this hotel is totally unprofessional,1
5708,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the pool all day long,1
5709,we finaly got checked in and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
5710,when i tried to get a refund from expedia but the hotel would not honor my reservation said it didn't exist,1
5711,there were black and brown stains all over the drapes that looked like blood,1
5712,the door to our room we were moved out of the room next door all night imagine my surprise when i,1
5713,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
5714,the room was dirty there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo,1
5715,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
5716,i requested 2 beds when we got to the room i understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray,1
5717,when we checked in no one was at the front desk was helpful and brought us a rollaway,1
5718,it was late and we were tired but we will not stay at another red roof inn,1
5719,we called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
5720,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and even though they couldn't find my reservation,1
5721,the staff was friendly extremely helpful and went out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
5722,i kept thinking about the dirty carpets and was not able to lay my head on the pillow due to the uncleanliness,1
5723,this was one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had to stay in a room over night,1
5724,needless to say my friend and i and we couldn't sleep as the drilling and hammering started early morning,1
5725,was hoping for a romantic night and it was actually cooler outside in the middle of the night,1
5726,additionally the wifi doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is old and it smells,1
5727,they quoted us one rate and changed it when we checked out we didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
5728,got to the room it's very outdated,1
5729,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
5730,there was no fridge in this room even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
5731,the front desk staff was friendly and the price was right and the room was disgusting,1
5732,the hotel was easy off and on the highway and outside the hotel and he said it was for construction workers,1
5733,the front desk staff who were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
5734,the desk clerk said that housekeeping was gone for the day but lo behold no bath towels,1
5735,questioned him about how many people were in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
5736,room had holes in the walls and carpeting,1
5737,the place is nothing like the pictures on the website,1
5738,there were bus all over the bathroom no sheets on the bed the first day but didn't thing anything of it,1

5744,room smelled like smoke even though it was apparently a non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
5745,it was 90 when we arrived and the a c was too small to cool the entire room down,1
5746,i took pictures of the room to go kill time,1
5747,they answered our questions curtly and seemed to want us out of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
5748,it rained my final day in town which canceled my work for the day and we were going somewhere else instead,1
5749,and there were no rooms available however the hotel was less than pleasant,1
5750,best i got was a late check our since we were in the water and could not take a bath had to use shower 4,1

5762,would not stay here if you don't stay,1
5763,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
5764,we booked at this hotel specifically because we were traveling with a group of senior citizens,1
5765,i walked up the stairs and opened the door to the room and they don't make hotel to be aware of it too,1
5766,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
5767,the staff was warm and inviting even around the midnight hour when i checked in they didn't have the courage to try,1
5768,i did inquire if the room was 50 bucks per night,1
5769,when i woke up i found there were no towels there were stains on the sheets,1
5770,the manager of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1
5771,well for starters my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1

5789,the furniture in the room was peeling off the walls,1
5790,i booked through hotels but when we got their they told us they had to leave,1

5793,upon checking in was told that the place was pretty awful right now,1
5794,the new room had blood stains on the bed sheets and prostitution going on in the parking lot,1
5795,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
5796,i will not come to this facility again i do not recommend this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
5797,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the morning congested and feeling sickly,1
5798,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room and the front desk guy is rude,1
5799,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
5800,they have no time to come the room to look at the room to say it wasn't better,1
5801,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't booked on line i would have insisted on my money back,1
5802,the bathroom was the nastiest bathroom that i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
5803,also even though it was supposly a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
5804,sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get checked in get ready and go to the function,1
5805,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the lot,1
5806,then the room was trashing one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a tiny room,1
5807,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
5808,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
5809,let me just say i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
5810,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to share a bed which i was poorly compensated for,1
5811,after two more tries we contacted the front desk and he said he would look for the dial,1
5812,when water in the bathroom was very dirty,1
5813,went down to the front desk to make a complaint and get the front desk to complain the night manager had an attitude,1
5814,the only good thing about this hotel is that it is not as pictured online and suggest that they avoid this hotel,1
5815,trash behind night stand and bathroom door and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
5816,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
5817,the people at the front desk was great,1
5818,we always had to go to the front desk were very nice and tried to help as much as possible,1

5822,crossing the border from canada we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
5823,the temperature fluctuated while taking a shower television never worked correctly microwave did not work and they wanted to give me points,1
5824,the only thing good about this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
5825,the carpet looked clean but it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
5826,first room the cable didn't work and the refrigerator didn't work,1
5827,the parking lot was different being in front of the facade of the building,1
5828,the wifi was pathetic beyond pathetic i felt i was going to get shot or killed,1
5829,not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it,1
5830,checked out 4 hours after check in and had to go back to desk to get help,1
5831,called the front desk to let them know we were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel for my son graduation,1
5832,there was yelling and screaming coming from another room but it was working,1
5833,i tried to call the front desk they did not care,1
5834,after getting our room i noticed there were no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories,1
5835,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
5836,crossing the border from canada we were given a couple cards neither of which opened the door,1
5837,i had to switch rooms 3 times because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well,1
5838,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
5839,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
5840,so i cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation here using up some reward points,1
5841,moved next day room was not made again no towels ac was not working well stains on comforter covers for the bed,1
5842,the hotel is terrible and i don't recommend this place at all,1
5843,first room we were given a tiny room,1
5844,best i could do was put a chair in front of it to block it just in case,1
5845,from the moment i went inside the lobby to check in there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
5846,was a very bad experience and i would never go there again,1
5847,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
5848,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
5849,i will not stay at this hotel unless you smoked,1
5850,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke,1
5851,when i told the front desk lady had a nasty attitude,1
5852,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
5853,also the pool was empty and looked as if it had a decent amount of value,1
5854,they never asked how our stay was and when i mentioned the bed bugs the front desk attendant was not very hospitable and somewhat dismissive,1
5855,i arrived late looking for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
5856,location this hotel is right in the middle of august you need the ac,1
5857,if you ever go to the front desk and we had really spotty wifi,1
5858,first of all there was only one towel in the room,1
5859,then the room was trashing one of the beds was soaked with who knows what,1
5860,i tried to call the front desk they still charged me for the night,1
5861,however it is not worth the price,1
5862,no towels in room we had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
5863,i called every hotel in the city booked,1
5864,i always book through hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
5865,the bed spreads where soiled and i had to put it back together,1
5866,as a traveler i needed a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel,1
5867,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
5868,on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
5869,i realized after staying here that there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1
5870,other places i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was perfectly located,1
5871,was told no other rooms were available and didn't try moving to another room like i would trust the hotel anymore,1
5872,i was getting ready to take a shower and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
5873,he checked the room to make sure it was the right room woke everyone up and didn't even shut and latch,1
5874,listed breakfast but have no idea where it would have been the worst i've seen,1
5875,checked in and within 10 minutes realized there were bed bugs in this hotel and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge,1
5876,this time they couldn't scan my credit card so they said i could not get a third key 3,1
5877,he told us to go to the front desk and we had to wait 2 hours to get the room down in about 5 hours,1
5878,obviously picked this place because it was cheap but wish i would have kept on looking for another hotel,1
5879,and the best i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
5880,it had to be the worst hotel i've ever done,1
5881,i did check out early but because i had paid expedia i could not get a receipt because it was prepaid,1
5882,there was hair all over the walls from where people had been smoking in that room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
5883,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water,1
5884,there are tons of hotels motels around the country and this was one of the worst hotels i have ever been,1
5885,their lounge barleycorn's didn't have a double bed which wasn't a big fan of the 1970s decor or the dirty carpet either,1
5886,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel,1
5887,i went down to the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said we could not stay there and requested our money back,1
5888,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
5889,i had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early because i couldn't check in till 4,1
5890,when i walked in the room and we were,1
5891,manager the next day said i should have let her know sooner,1
5892,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the toilet was the cleanest part of the room,1
5893,when i went on line to search for hotels and i looked at each other and decided maybe we needed to do that,1
5894,the blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was a room for 4 we had to beg for toilet paper,1
5895,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
5896,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
5897,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
5898,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and even though they couldn't find my reservation,1
5899,i spoke with the manager who did nothing,1
5900,worst comfort inn that i have stayed in the was the worst,1
5901,returned to the hotel for our second night we were woken up by the recycling dealer dumping cans,1
5902,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to open the window because the room stunk so bad,1
5903,i knew that i would be charged 3,1
5904,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and quite nice,1
5905,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
5906,this was probably one of the worst places i have ever stayed in,1
5907,first one didn't lock second didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally the shower,1
5908,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
5909,99 price they have posted on the highway and reasonably priced which were our main points for selection,1
5910,they also did not disclose that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
5911,needless to say i will not be staying again and it is a shame because the hotel was nice,1
5912,no wonder this hotel was not clean do not stay here for any reason,1
5913,i had to switch rooms 3 times because the front desk staff particularly jeanette and sunny are rude and discourteous,1
5914,the front desk lied to us when we checked in at night into the last room available,1
5915,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained and dirty so slept on top of them,1
5916,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,1
5917,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
5918,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
5919,it was a horrible stay we were able to find another place more money for wednesday through monday,1
5920,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,1
5921,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
5922,we took the food out cleaned the microwave but the smell was not coming from shower i called front desk one staff came and checked,1
5923,the hotel smelled it wasn't clean i could stop by,1
5924,the receptionist who check us in was very sweet and friendly,1
5925,we were told we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
5926,to top it all off they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
5927,the bathroom was unacceptable hair and dirt in toilet and the shower was dirty enough to cause me to skip it,1
5928,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
5929,we went back to the front office but they wouldn't adjust the price,1
5930,i called the police and was told not there problem,1
5931,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and then he would refund the price,1
5932,i booked through hotels but when we got their they told us they had already sold the room and didn't have anything available,1
5933,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible after breakfast,1
5934,if you can't stay in that room for a long time,1
5935,clean what i don't know if i'd stay there again i see why it was so cheap,1
5936,we walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter,1
5937,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
5938,the room was small the bed was hard and pillows were few,1
5939,this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
5940,when we arrived at the hotel around midnight,1

5968,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
5969,motel 6 would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and they at least had security there,1
5970,during the beginning check in everything looked very quaint and as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
5971,there were strands of hair all over the bathroom even trails of ants in the sink area,1
5972,i was in a rush and i didn't know that on the weekends the hotel becomes a free for all,1

5979,it was so bad that we couldn't even get in to it to buy anything,1

5986,i was tired and ready to go to bed it was so gross,1
5987,first one didn't lock second didn't have a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
5988,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
5989,once there was told it was not available in the pool area,1
5990,i can honestly say this is probably the filthiest hotel i have ever stayed at,1
5991,she has no ability or desire to resolve issues and the rest of the reservation and they refused to do anything,1
5992,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1

5998,we were put in a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
5999,did not like having to leave a cash deposit they will try to get money over and over for damages they refuse to fix,1
6000,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
6001,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1

6003,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed in ever,1
6004,we had no wash clothes in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
6005,we had just finished a 6 hr drive and were rushed out of the room immediatly and there were no sighting of any bedbugs there,1

6007,i would not recommend this hotel at all the worst experience i have ever had,1
6008,do not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1

6015,there is no excuse for a room that was the size of a closet,1
6016,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
6017,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1

6019,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
6020,i checked out early and got my money back through my credit card,1
6021,the only good thing was air conditioning and the bathroom was from the 70's,1
6022,traveling with toddlers we couldn't leave the sliders open so the room was paid for hotel released it upon complaint,1
6023,the management didnt do anything about it b c i booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do,1
6024,we asked where to check in and they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
6025,i fortunately looked through the peep hole and the man from the front desk,1
6026,the receptionist said they didn't put the bugs in the room on our first night,1
6027,the telephone in our room didn't work so i changed rooms and it was just disgusting,1

6032,truthfully we would have been charged for the same day cancellation,1
6033,the girl at the front desk was very rude and unaccomidating,1
6034,they put ear plugs in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
6035,we did go ask the manager but she said she had to pay the maid to clean the room again,1
6036,the location is scary our room looked like it has not been updated since the 70's,1
6037,if i had not been exhausted and desperate for a room and it was impossible to change to non smoking,1
6038,the walls and remainder of the room were literally falling apart,1
6039,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
6040,we live out of town and we stayed at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
6041,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
6042,after such a wonderful day me and my family will not stay in a days inn again,1

6182,enjoy a complimentary breakfast buffet and a kids-stay-free policy for children 17 and under staying with their parents,1
6183,then we tried to use the bathroom shower and toilet that wouldn't flush,1

6190,when i went to the front desk they still charged me for the night anyway,1
6191,mattress was hard as a rock there was one sheet on the bed and left for the afternoon,1
6192,it was the worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
6193,even though we produced the reservation papers showing 3 people we were told we were lucky to have a room,1
6194,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel for business because my company picked it,1
6195,carpet in my room was a double the beds were old and we could feel the springs,1
6196,that had to be the worst hotel i've stayed at at least give until 12 or 1 pm without an issue,1
6197,we had a smoking room and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
6198,next room had no hot water so we were moved the next morning when i notice soap scum and grime in the bathroom,1
6199,t-v controls did not work properly room was dusty,1
6200,she told us she would move us to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1
6201,one had no drapes and despite our numerous attempts to get some they gave me two hand towels and apologized,1
6202,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and even though they couldn't find the place,1
6203,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend the knights inn to anyone,1
6204,our receipt from hotels said there was room service but there was no room regardless of the confirmation we had,1
6205,do not stay here it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
6206,the reservation was wrong and i had to change rooms first day,1
6207,tge staff is friendly but the rooms are not anything special,1
6208,5 hours and by the time we came back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
6209,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
6210,they were rude the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor was under construction,1
6211,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
6212,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
6213,my bathroom floor had bootprints all over it and down in to the cushion,1
6214,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
6215,i could not even used it we had no tv remote in the room the toilet seat was stickey,1
6216,the door looked like it was kicked in the room had an awful smell to it,1
6217,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the bath towels had black dirty stains,1
6218,no one said anything to them they took over this hotel for the location and because the whole team was staying there,1
6219,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
6220,i am a gm at a hotel in my life time,1
6221,the hotel was cheap and close to the beach but not worth the cost of what we paid for the night,1
6222,the hotel itself was very nice and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
6223,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks left feet or socks black,1
6224,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even up to a 2 star,1
6225,panhandlers no door man lobby was ugly had to walk through the facility with employee to find a clean room,1
6226,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was booked the next night,1
6227,went back to get a different room and was told it was on the beach,1
6228,arrived late with young child to find out the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor was under construction,1
6229,i don't think i'll be back later since i'm house hunting,1
6230,did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i've ever been in,1
6231,it took the front desk guy is rude,1
6232,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel with a very lodge-like feel,1
6233,apon checking into my room i had to keep the window open for fresh air,1
6234,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
6235,got a smoking room when we came in,1
6236,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
6237,i will not be staying at this hotel the staff is horrible and the rooms are much nicer,1
6238,it was not worth the money thank god only for one night and deal with it the next day,1
6239,the lobby had a funny smell and the room was 155 dollars for the night,1
6240,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
6241,the last thing i could take was lizards on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
6242,we booked a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room and we are no smokers,1
6243,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
6244,booked it online last min the pictures online are very deceiving and was not what i had reserved plus,1
6245,why would i use hotels again when i can't even recommend it for that purpose,1
6246,and the alarm clock did not work properly room was dusty,1
6247,i would never return or recommend this place to anyone i would rather sleep in my car next time before booking this dump,1
6248,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so security was a joke,1
6249,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
6250,i paid 139 per night for this room and i would have rather stayed at a motel 6,1
6251,any time we would go to the front desk they said that there is no air conditioning in this hotel,1
6252,i ended up here because there were no other rooms to switch to,1
6253,my room despite being told it was a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on it,1
6254,there not towels in the room and roaches crawling everywhere,1
6255,i had to find another hotel and i am still waiting to get my money back because of the no refund thing,1
6256,i called the front desk and they just said,1
6257,the air conditioning didn't work and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid for hotel released it upon complaint,1
6258,we called the front desk and told them what was going on in the parking lot,1
6259,i had to sleep in the car because there was no a c in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
6260,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the smell of smoke permeates the hallways the rooms,1
6261,staff was very friendly and helpful but the rooms and the persons in the hotel dont care,1
6262,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
6263,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed at,1
6264,when we got to the hotel at 10 pm i was putting my 1 year old son i was ready to just sleep,1
6265,the funky sour old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
6266,the people at the front desk checking out,1
6267,the guy that booked over the phone i would be able to assist,1
6268,prior to checking in i called the front desk to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
6269,i want to let everyone know that it is not that far from there,1
6270,when i told the receptionist i didn't want to delay sleep by asking for maintenance to come,1
6271,their where drunks and smell like urine i only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
6272,this one had a heavy scent of bleach in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
6273,the front desk girl by the name of gina was rude and very unprofessional,1
6274,all the reason we will not stay at this hotel again even if i was homeless,1
6275,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
6276,i am almost certain this happened in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
6277,i will have a hard time with the check in,1
6278,holes in the towels hair all in the shower hair on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
6279,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had one in the previous room,1
6280,it was by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
6281,the room did not allow that with that kind of standard you'll probably be fine with this place,1
6282,the hotel was only 43 a night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
6283,i left immediately and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
6284,this has to be the worst hotel experience of my life,1
6285,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
6286,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
6287,we made the reservation and we couldn't sleep because of the smell from the room,1
6288,the inside lock on our room did not have a reservation,1
6289,the lock on our room door was broken and would not shut all the way,1
6290,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
6291,the room reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was old and stained,1
6292,great location it may not look like it did on the website,1
6293,i spoke to the front desk to ask for a deposit shoot they should have been cleaning our room,1
6294,the hotel was very run down there were no towels in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
6295,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk and they never fixed it,1
6296,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1
6297,the guy that booked over the phone i would be able to assist,1
6298,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
6299,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
6300,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel for two nights,1
6301,i will say the staff was very friendly and helpful,1
6302,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the toilet the seat fell off,1
6303,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
6304,i'll assume it was the room we had needed a deep clean,1
6305,overall i couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
6306,i got into the room and and every time we would go to the front desk once to quiet down a party next door,1
6307,we stayed here because the price was right and the room was actually nice,1
6308,the walls are paper thin and there were stains on it,1
6309,5 hours and by the time we came back to our room,1
6310,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the fourth of july ten months in advance,1
6311,i would never stay at this hotel the same nights,1
6312,the entire place reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on it,1
6313,one of the first things i did when we went in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't cancel it,1
6314,the air conditioner didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
6315,he told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me because i already checked in,1
6316,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel,1
6317,but the staff at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
6318,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
6319,there was a wad of hair on the floor and in the tub on tub walls,1
6320,well this hotel is terrible to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting and is in a bad neighborhood,1
6321,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
6322,an outside door was propped open and people were coming in and out of the rooms just like the men do with them,1
6323,ive stayed in several small hotels but this one was the worst we had ever stayed in,1
6324,the curtain rod was held up in the middle of renovation and it shows,1
6325,i can't believe we don't have any clean ones readily available,1
6326,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time ever i had numerous bites and an allergic reaction to something,1
6327,no wonder this hotel was not clean either,1
6328,they also kept asking if we wanted to shower as each room had one set we had two rooms both nightmares,1
6329,public areas are nice and the front desk never picked up,1
6330,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
6331,based on this needless to say i couldn't wait to check out,1
6332,it took a long time before we found out it was the heater and told them,1
6333,front desk staff was friendly and the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
6334,the room we were assigned should not have been renting rooms on the second floor and thus it was constantly loud and impossible to sleep,1
6335,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
6336,there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
6337,when i talked to the front desk and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
6338,we didnt want to chance anything getting thing broken we were told that the room we had needed a deep clean,1
6339,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
6340,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
6341,this was not on the website when i booked i put i needed a crib,1
6342,the manager of the hotel was filthy and smelled real bad,1
6343,i went to the front desk to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
6344,i called to make a reservation and the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
6345,the receptionist said they didn't have a place to stay,1

6350,i had trouble requesting a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
6351,i left early in the morning and he never did,1
6352,there was no air conditioning in this hotel,1
6353,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to wait to check in and they couldn't find my reservation,1
6354,this hotel should not be on expedia list,1
6355,i got this room for one night using hotels,1
6356,we booked an ada room since it was the last one available meaning that all their other rooms were taken,1
6357,the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
6358,the front desk told us our room was clean and the bed was very uncomfortable,1
6359,this place should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
6360,i feel expedia should not even list a hotel like this glad that we found a cockroach in one,1
6361,my stay at the motel 6 next door proved this was not the room i was placed in they then put me in another room,1
6362,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
6363,first we got a room with no amenities,1
6364,staff were very rude when they came to fix it they just removed it,1
6365,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to carry everything around with us,1
6366,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was told it was available and that i did not order on it,1
6367,no towels the electrical wires were exposed these units should never have been rented out it should have been a custodial closet,1
6368,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
6369,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
6370,in my room the furniture was old that could be tolerated,1
6371,we will never go back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
6372,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
6373,it was faustino who was at the front desk when we called at 9 pm,1
6374,the first response i got was i can't believe hotel has this one their site,1
6375,she then proceeded to tell me she was going to tell the manager that we were all over the pool,1
6376,on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
6377,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1

6388,the folks running from isaac would have been better off at motel 6 across the street,1
6389,the walls and carpet are seeping out smells from when it was a non smoking room and the room was decent,1
6390,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
6391,called 4 times until i finally someone to show up and get me a room and coffee,1
6392,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
6393,when we walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the mattress,1

6396,we cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
6397,after swimming we went back to the front desk and get more coffee sugar and toliet paper,1

6478,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
6479,the outside door wouldn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of these two giant corporations,1

6487,the stay was awful staff was rude and the rooms were not very clean,1
6488,i had ants in my room and it was cheap,1
6489,when asked to speak to a manager she said he was not available until afternoon i repeat never again,1
6490,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1

6492,i have to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
6493,the inside lock on our room door was broken and would not shut all the way,1
6494,well the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
6495,its not that i rated this motel with one star its that i had to go through my bank to be refunded,1
6496,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not reflect the pictures you saw of rooms on the website,1
6497,the room was dirty when we checked in they gave us a smoking room that smelled and looked horrible,1
6498,paid 100 and then changed our mind after seeing the room was i was tired and didn't feel safe for myself or my automobile,1
6499,during the beginning check in everything looked very quaint and as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
6500,as a reply to this note i was told that they didn't have room in the first floor my husband has especial needs,1
6501,i was very disappointed for the cost of the hotel we were greeted by the smell of the room,1
6502,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
6503,do not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
6504,we stayed there this time last year with an adequate room with a view this past weekend and it was a non smoking room,1
6505,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
6506,i was scared couldn't tell who they were considering the hotel was in need of serious remodeling and maintenance,1
6507,it was not what i booked or paid for and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
6508,not only was the pieces of furniture in the room was wet from a recent leak,1
6509,needless to say we will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1

6511,the carpet had rips all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
6512,the front desk did offer to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
6513,so we immediately went back to the lady at the front desk in the morning was clueless,1
6514,based on my experience i can't even get them to help me,1
6515,first of all there was power outage by the time we came back to our room to dry off and change after swimming,1
6516,the front desk did offer to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
6517,website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was ok before he checked us in,1
6518,paid way too much money for a room like this to anyone especially a handicap women,1
6519,we moved to a different hotel without notice,1
6520,the condition of one the beds was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
6521,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
6522,phone did not work so drove walked to front desk and they said they will call me back to solve the problem,1
6523,finally a man walked out of a door right next to the lake which is what we were looking for,1
6524,carpet in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
6525,i'm appalled by this place and it scared them straight,1
6526,we were switched to another room whose ac didn't work there were no shampoo and the towels were cleaner,1
6527,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
6528,i'm glad our room was at the another end of the building and my room was switched twice,1
6529,she didn't offer to move me the hotel was not clean do not stay here,1
6530,reception was nice and that was the only reason we booked with them,1
6531,short stuff and long waiting at the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude,1
6532,my wife has a bad knee and we had to put on the bed,1
6533,i finally attempted to use the shower and the tub would take forever to drain,1
6534,to the point where i can't believe they keep booking this hotel,1
6535,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
6536,room was small dirty and it smelled like marijuana and i really could not stay there and requested our money back,1
6537,told the male manager and he said he would look for the dial,1
6538,my sister and i stayed here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion,1
6539,i called ahead of time to let the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
6540,the guy at the front desk and have someone come right up to my room to find the toilet clogged with toilet paper and poop,1
6541,we did get a dirty bathroom a toilet i had to ask for breakfast items and coffee hot water were never hotter than lukewarm,1
6542,there was no fridge in this room even though we had just walked from there and took pictures,1
6543,the next day i contacted hotels and they told me of course housekeeping didn't find anything so,1
6544,listed breakfast but have no idea where it would have been more pleasant without finding a condom wrapper under the bed,1
6545,he told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me because i already checked in,1
6546,i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures,1
6547,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the hotel could use some updates,1
6548,will never stay at another comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
6549,i booked through hotels and when i got to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
6550,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone said yes they don't seem to care about anything,1
6551,but after three hours later after we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
6552,horrible some employee went into my room while i was at my meeting so we chose a bed and breakfast or country inn,1
6553,there were other guests in the parking lot were dead rodents,1
6554,to top it off we went in the room was old the towels and bed sheets,1
6555,i would definately not dear to stay at this comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
6556,when i went to checkout i didn't even let me look through the glass door at the pool,1
6557,took coffee cups to my room and i went up to find that the room was used before,1
6558,the hotel and rooms had a bad smell dirty carpets and stained ceiling,1
6559,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
6560,but i still decided to take a chance i asked the front desk the desk clerk was less than concerned with customer service,1
6561,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
6562,room was ok for a 1 night stay this is not a place anyone should stay,1
6563,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
6564,hotel sits in the middle of july than it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
6565,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i had made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
6566,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
6567,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the tv,1
6568,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a blood stain,1
6569,after one night in the restaurant which wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1
6570,they had no one available to look at it they already had it on the bedroom,1
6571,lastly we asked for a room upgrade and was denied because i booked through expedia and not them directly,1
6572,there was a white papery glob stuck to the back of the door looked like it had not been cleaned either,1
6573,the room was dirty when we checked in no one was at the front desk was creepy,1
6574,worse thing was next day there was not hot water in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
6575,this could have been an awesome experience but the rooms were out of sight for the days we were looking at,1
6576,the smell of smoke was so strong we knew we would not be checking into the hotel,1
6577,the nighttime attendant marcus was as helpful as she could be,1
6578,i made last minute reservations and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
6579,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
6580,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
6581,this was probably one of the worst if not the worst hotel experience of my life,1
6582,the first room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
6583,we checked in and the sheets and blankets were of very poor quality,1
6584,wierd looking men were sitting in chairs in the parking lot directly in front of the pool,1
6585,also a c looks like it's going to be uncomfortable in the room,1
6586,second when we returned to the hotel after the allowed check-in time we were told that they were pet friendly,1
6587,the clerk at the front desk checking out,1
6588,upon arriving they did not have any amenities as promised,1
6589,there we no trash cans in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get either dat that we stayed,1
6590,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
6591,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
6592,there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and i ended up paying 120 to stay across the street,1
6593,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
6594,room was not worth the money for a room like this,1
6595,the room smelled the air didn't work and it looked like white fluids that had dried,1
6596,i was told i could get a key for the room,1
6597,terrible customer service they failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
6598,i realized this when i booked the room for 5 minutes,1
6599,the staff member said i can't believe these can get away with this,1
6600,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
6601,there is no hairdryer in the room you realize the illusion,1
6602,we booked 2 nights at this hotel for my son graduation,1
6603,let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a better location or better motel hotel,1
6604,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
6605,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
6606,i went back down to ask for a different room but no changes were made,1
6607,hotel didn't honor our non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
6608,the hotel was only 43 a night and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
6609,was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with two queen beds as i had requested,1
6610,they need to find a new hotel at 11 pm after a long day,1
6611,the tub was so bad that there was no ice machine on the premises,1
6612,when i pulled up i was so disappointed in this hotel,1
6613,the water in the bath room as well as steps leading up to the second floor had loose wobbly steps,1
6614,the inside of the hotel and the rooms,1
6615,swimming pool was very cold so i went back to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations,1
6616,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
6617,i am a gm at a hotel in my life i stay on the road a,1
6618,the girls on the reception were very rude they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
6619,i checked in on 4 16 15 and the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
6620,ac unit did not work properly there were no towels of any kind in the room bed was short-sheeted,1
6621,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms both nightmares,1
6622,the elevator was disgusting someone urinated all over the inside of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
6623,and the bed was very comfortable but that's all i heard from them,1
6624,we had to pack up and move to a different hotel that is how dirty this hotel was,1
6625,we tried to leave and we were told to go find a table,1
6626,when i talked to the front desk and get a plunger and take care of our own toilet without any attempt of assistance from them,1
6627,room was not vacuumed curtain hanging down the bathroom was not working they never fix it also,1
6628,the second room we had to deal with nonsense from an incompetent employee,1
6629,the staff was very friendly but the place was horrible,1
6630,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
6631,the service was horrible the room was not cleaned or given fresh towels,1
6632,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
6633,i was told the there were no rooms available however the hotel was less than pleasant,1
6634,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
6635,i was told i had to speak with the manager and she seemed to have no care,1
6636,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced for the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
6637,we were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel for my son graduation,1
6638,stay far far away from this place would not recommend it to anyone,1
6639,the ac was noisy and barely doing any work and the bed looked comfortable however i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
6640,i made last minute reservations and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
6641,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls did not match,1
6642,i called the front desk to ask for another room and they said sorry were sold out,1
6643,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work most of the time did not work at all,1
6644,when i went down to the front desk they did not care,1
6645,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
6646,best i got was a late check our since we were in the water and we had to switch hotels,1
6647,the hotel was going under renovation while we were there we had to beg for toilet paper,1
6648,the juice machine didn't work for breakfast and the service was so bad it ruined my whole experience in venice,1
6649,we were promised a bottom floor because of my wife's and i favorite in the north conway area,1
6650,they again said they would not refund my money and that it is not that far from there,1
6651,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building but this would put me a stones throw from the highway,1
6652,we did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
6653,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel,1
6654,asked for a refund or discount and the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
6655,so i went back down to ask for a wash cloth,1
6656,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and plenty of little roaches,1
6657,went on a long motorcycle ride and just wanted to get to our room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
6658,when i booked i asked about it and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
6659,the room was oaky but i will never go back to the front deck,1
6660,they said they have breakfast and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
6661,the only reason i choose that room was because i was given a much lower price when,1
6662,he finally came to his senses and gave us a future credit but thise jerks wanted their extra 20,1
6663,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
6664,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far the dirtiest place i have ever stayed in,1
6665,they tell you one thing on the phone and didn't have anything it said it should,1
6666,the hotel appears to be in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it,1
6667,she did not tell me till the next morning i think next time i,1
6668,we arrived at this hotel with our dogs after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
6669,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and quickly move me to another room it was about the same,1
6670,while attempting to check out of a hotel,1
6671,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
6672,we had the heat full blast and we froze in the middle of our conversation to help 3 other people,1
6673,the non-smoking room like we had booked they said that the room wasn't the cleanest and staff wasn't the nicest,1
6674,in my room the furniture was old that could be tolerated,1
6675,when we got back again there was water all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
6676,next time i will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay,1
6677,when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
6678,i was informed by the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
6679,we went to stay at the super 8 then proceeded to tell me,1
6680,i would never stay at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
6681,my husband and i later agreed that it had to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
6682,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
6683,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
6684,will not be staying again and it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
6685,the room was carpeting in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
6686,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and in the hallways until after 4 am,1
6687,when we entered the room the windows were open and the smell was covered up by air freshener,1
6688,the tub was so bad that we couldn't even get my wheelchair in the bathroom door,1
6689,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most disgusting place i have ever stayed at,1
6690,so sad to have to pay for the doctor's visit plus the medicine,1
6691,the elevator was disgusting someone urinated all over the inside of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
6692,woke up to no hot water for an early morning shower,1
6693,after a week i started to notice a foul smell,1
6694,do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
6695,would not stay at this hotel again even if i was paid,1
6696,when i complained the manager said there was nothing wrong with the card the hotel should have called me,1
6697,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
6698,when i opened the shower curtain to take a shower and there was no attempt to fix it,1
6699,we arrived on time in the front and they said they didn't put the bugs in the room and walked right back out,1
6700,no notice by management that you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time,1
6701,while i agree that the staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
6702,things finally settled down about 5 am and i packed up checked out a day before i did not feel safe,1
6703,night two had to go to the room which had already been paid through my credit card,1
6704,we booked the room late at 11 pm room was ice cold,1
6705,to be honest i wouldn't stay the night and lost my money since it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
6706,i did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
6707,the room had pretty hair all over it as if somebody just took a shower and slept with the towels around me,1
6708,i went to check out the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
6709,it was late i need a place to crash for one night during our long drive,1
6710,six out of eight people were in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
6711,and who knows may be just because we were so tired on top of that a half of role of toilet paper,1
6712,the staff was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
6713,after we got to our room and there was hair on the bedspread the inside of the hotel and outside,1
6714,well to start off the front desk person didn't care,1
6715,hotel renovation was that they've taken out the hot tub and the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it,1
6716,the room was hot ac was not working and looked like someone was partying in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
6717,there were no towels there were stains on walls carpet and towels,1
6718,i will be registering a complaint with the board of health should look into the cleanliness of this place,1
6719,i do not recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here,1
6720,and we were told that the room would smell,1
6721,here we are in the process of closing the front office,1
6722,there was a group at the hotel the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
6723,we will not be staying at this hotel and i had to search for another one in the middle of no where and near nothing,1
6724,needless to say we will never ever stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
6725,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
6726,this was the worst hotel i have stayed at this chain before,1
6727,when we got in the room it was very hot,1
6728,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
6729,yes i get that there was a 45 minute wait,1
6730,room had strong musty old cigarette stink that did not fade fridge did not work tv got one station with no volume,1
6731,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what my total was for the night,1
6732,when i went to the desk to get it reprogrammed,1
6733,hotel sits in the middle of the night,1
6734,we were unable to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
6735,i'm an ihg gold member and i have stayed at in my life for the followings reasons,1
6736,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
6737,the only piece of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was scorched and did not work,1
6738,the outer access doors were unlocked so there was no way to take a shower,1
6739,i realized this when i booked the room,1
6740,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
6741,this is by far the worst dirtiest motel i've ever heard of,1
6742,there was no fridge in this room even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
6743,loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot and the walk way faced the canal,1
6744,when i complained the manager said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean,1
6745,other places i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
6746,we asked the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in and they gave our room away,1
6747,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any available single bedrooms,1
6748,the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet and so was the bed,1
6749,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to change rooms first day,1
6750,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
6751,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
6752,this motel should be torn down and rebuilt,1
6753,the room was small the bed was hard and pillows were few,1
6754,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach but not worth the price,1
6755,casino was fine but i will never go to this chain again,1
6756,there is no security the staff is extremely rude and not well trained,1
6757,was relieved to move next door to the comfort inn for the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
6758,the location is scary our room looked like it was not very good the room did not work and get any programming,1
6759,i spent three nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
6760,white sheets had yellow stains and hair on them and the footprints were not ours,1
6761,the paint in the room was old and dated,1
6762,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the doctor and when i returned my room was trashed,1
6763,the rates were exceptional and the room wasn't ready till 4:30pm,1
6764,not opposed to other cultures but if you are traveling for work the glass elevators don't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
6765,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
6766,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute room at 1 am,1
6767,the the second room had dead pill bugs on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
6768,air conditioner did not work properly there were no towels and when,1
6769,i would not recommend this motel to anyone,1
6770,the room was was descent on the inside but with a flat panel tv,1
6771,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
6772,i went to the bathroom there was blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
6773,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have any clean ones readily available,1
6774,but the good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
6775,i would not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
6776,we arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub and rinse this way,1
6777,the hotel needs major work the room was nasty we could not take a shower till morning,1
6778,i will be registering a complaint with the board of health should look into the cleanliness of this place,1
6779,when i arrived at the hotel i was told the reservation for the second room would be cancelled,1
6780,i'm a hhilton member so i choose this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
6781,the bed was itchy and my travel buddy and i woke up in the morning with a credit soooooo helpful,1
6782,they said they were completely booked i couldn't get towels for my room,1
6783,when i try to get my money back from the hotel,1
6784,there was only one luggage cart and no elevator which wasn't a big fan of the 1970s decor or the dirty carpet either,1
6785,window didnt open air conditioner did not run properly 5,1
6786,we just needed a room for a disabled person,1
6787,if this place were inspected there would be a 15 early check in fee,1
6788,obviously the bathroom and the smell was still there,1
6789,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
6790,there is low income housing and the room is extremely musky and dusty,1
6791,the desk lamp did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
6792,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
6793,we stayed on the second floor and as soon as we entered the room and the fireplace,1
6794,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
6795,00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact that we booked with expedia,1
6796,while the hotel was clean the bed was hard and pillows were few,1
6797,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
6798,hotel front staff was rude and the rooms were not very clean,1
6799,well 4:30 am arrives and the front desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
6800,i called in advance to request an early check in but he would make note of the request quite understandable,1
6801,i had a business meeting that i had to so i can review,1
6802,must have taken a few hours for the room to be cleaned and fell on deaf ears,1
6803,i booked this hotel for a one or two night stay,1
6804,this hotel is called extended stay america but i wouldn't recommend the knights inn to anyone,1
6805,wrong rooms the room i booked was not the room i viewed pictures of on your website before booking,1
6806,was told we could cancel and get a refund and he said expedia hotels makes that decision and i should call them,1
6807,we felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay at this hotel again even if the night was free,1
6808,the bathroom had a hair in the shower and on towels,1
6809,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk always went out of their way to accomodate us,1
6810,called corporate and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have reservation and charged me for already paid stay,1
6811,avoid this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the hotel or the people staying there,1
6812,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the lobby back there the key difficult to use,1
6813,some parts you would not want to look at it at 10 the next day,1
6814,and the best i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
6815,this is our first time staying at a quality inn i've ever had only thing that was ok was the beds were comfortable,1
6816,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
6817,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very nice we will never stay at this hotel again,1
6818,one more think the parking lot is full of potholes,1
6819,called back later to again try and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
6820,shower head was coming out the wall the air conditioner didn't work and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
6821,the rooms were dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed if almost all the parking lot was lousy,1
6822,i can't comment on the staff i only saw the front desk person didn't try to help the situation at all,1
6823,the room was okay but really no rooms should have been rented out it should have been a much nicer hotel,1
6824,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel we have stayed at,1
6825,tge staff is friendly but the rooms are not well kept,1
6826,well to start off the front desk person was heavenly though so nice,1
6827,would not recommend this hotel at all the worst experience i have ever had in my life,1
6828,decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there and windows would not close,1
6829,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and very helpful and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
6830,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were nice though the carpets were dirty and frayed,1
6831,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
6832,needless to say i couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
6833,i have actually stayed here before and the room was decent,1
6834,the furniture and carpet in the room was old and in need of repair,1
6835,patch painting in the room and we left,1
6836,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one unbelievable issue after another,1
6837,from the valet to the front desk to let them know about this but no response,1
6838,she said that was all they had and i told her i would have to say this was the worse experience i have ever had,1
6839,it's just not worth the money for a room,1
6840,and my non-smoking room but the,1
6841,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty and unkempt water was dripping on the stairs and looked unsafe,1
6842,then we get to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
6843,so much in this room was so bad,1
6844,i had bite marks all on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
6845,i always book through hotels and have never before stayed in one with no place to stay,1
6846,i arrived late and the receptionist insisted that i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
6847,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
6848,i booked through hotels that she couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
6849,it started with the games regarding the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms,1
6850,internet was very slow and most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
6851,this place is absolutely the worst hotel i have ever seen,1
6852,view moregarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the tv,1
6853,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
6854,i would never stay at this location again,1
6855,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
6856,historic old portland disapointing my husband and i looked at the peephole i witnessed a fight,1
6857,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
6858,first of all the front desk had no idea what they were doing,1
6859,dirty room with cokroch in bed hair all over the bed after the pillows were lifted was an utterly horrible experience,1
6860,tried to eat at the restaurant in the hote for breakfast and the cereal offered might have been a nice motel,1
6861,sheets had black stains on them mattress was extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
6862,we had booked a standard queen i was with my son and was told that booking online didn't guarantee any specific just a room,1
6863,no heat in the room and when i went to check out they refused to give us a refund,1
6864,and finally we went down to the front desk and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
6865,one of the worst ones i have stayed at super 8's before and had no trouble,1
6866,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place,1
6867,i do not recommend fiesta inn and suites is a bad form of advertisement,1
6868,noisy location no tv remote sticky carpet hair in the shower wall and remained there the whole time of our stay,1
6869,shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor this time we called from our cell phone,1
6870,in all my travels it's the second worst place i have ever walked into in my life,1
6871,casino was fine but i will never stay there again place smells like bug spray in the roaches inside the room,1
6872,the front desk is vacant most of the time did not work at all,1
6873,we didn't even stay we had to go get them dresser had diapers in drawer,1
6874,the room was very hot and even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
6875,the third room was little stinky but we decided to stay here after visiting cedar point for the day,1
6876,we walked into the room and started to close the door turn on the vent fan,1
6877,the pool water was green and full of bugs the carpet was dirty and stained but the sheets were clean,1
6878,horrible experience hotel did nothing to credit me they had teens running around all hours of the day and night pretty sure it involved drugs,1
6879,not the worst place i have ever been in,1
6880,he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
6881,got a headache every time i went to the hampton inn across the street,1
6882,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained and dirty so slept on top of them,1
6883,i took a picture to provide to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors,1
6884,i was not aware when i made my reservation site unseen because i was afraid to walk on the bathroom floor,1
6885,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
6886,the pool was closed for repairs which was one of the worst rooms ever,1
6887,went to the front desk and they said they would get someone to look at it they already had it on the bedroom,1
6888,the bathroom sink was stopped up through our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say,1
6889,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever been to,1
6890,if it would have said grab and go i would have never ever stayed at that super 8 hotel,1
6891,when checking in were told we couldn't receive a refund,1
6892,then he put me on hold and came back to the room to show us how to operate the tv,1
6893,after we got to our room we opened the door to the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for stoage,1
6894,the service was horrible the room was not cleaned,1
6895,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel,1
6896,some parts you would not want to look at it at 10 the next day,1
6897,good for the price and for a 1 night stop-over each way during spring vacation,1
6898,the cleanliness was lacking i lifted the toilet seat and there was hair and lots of dirt and hair of the previous occupant,1
6899,we asked for another room and the hotel there were problems,1
6900,the room that i was and had no working ac so they moved me to another room it was about the same,1
6901,was also charged for room service i didn't even feel comfortable taking a shower,1
6902,i was forced to take late at night after a long drive from florida without a reservation,1
6903,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach but not worth the price per night that we paid,1
6904,the staff were very rude when they came to fix it they just removed it,1
6905,sheets were still damp and the smell was so bad i didnt even go back for my 2nd night,1
6906,there were black and brown stains all over the drapes that looked like blood,1
6907,my wife and i went to marriot hotel,1
6908,i'm not sure i will ever stay there again and would not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
6909,worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the elevator and there empty beer bottles in the floor,1
6910,next day a man not sure if it the environment or the community,1
6911,other room clock broken tub took 30 minutes to even get checked in,1
6912,i reserved a non smoking room and it smelled like smoke even though it was a no smoking room,1
6913,the first room they offered me was one in which the front desk person was insulting and possibly high,1
6914,they sent up maintenance to the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
6915,we stay in this area often and we will never stay here again when visiting family,1
6916,tried to eat at the restaurant in the hote for breakfast and the cereal offered might have been a nice motel,1
6917,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1
6918,it was in a very good location and the service staff was very friendly but the guests and people hanging out made me feel uncomfortable,1
6919,when it was our turn we immediately explained that we were going to notice the bleach stains on the couch chair and floor,1
6920,i can live with outdated interior but i am not a fan of faux-wood flooring but we definitely holed up,1
6921,room service failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
6922,i arrived late looking for a last minute one night stay,1
6923,we moved to a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great time there,1

6929,first room was reeking of smoke i specified a non smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
6930,dirty dishes and the hall entering the room was so small that the luggage cart couldn't even fit in,1
6931,on top of everything there was a man passed out in the lobby,1
6932,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
6933,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever been in,1
6934,it is a shame because we have stayed there a few years back and it was ok,1
6935,the place looked nice enough the price was right and it advertised a pool,1
6936,unless i am desperate for a hotel room in this area i will never stay here or another days inn again,1
6937,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
6938,apon checking into my room i had to keep the window open for the two days we were there,1
6939,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1
6940,it reeked of tobacco and we asked for help and the front desk person had to change it out himself,1
6941,the tv is in sd and not hd and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open,1
6942,i went and told the man at the front desk said they needed at least 48 hours for a cancellation,1
6943,on a more positive note the woman at the front desk the next morning was the one positive of this stay,1
6944,need to be shut down and demolished,1
6945,they moved to the hot tub and the pool is dirty looking with barely any water in it,1
6946,all the lights didn't work the air conditioner didn't work properly,1
6947,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
6948,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
6949,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of the night and personnel do not want to stay here,1
6950,it was dark when we arrived and i had asked about the men in the parking lot,1
6951,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the front desk for some but they never arrived,1
6952,woke up with bites all over my upper body and legs,1
6953,i wish i could get my money back because of the no refund thing,1
6954,the door to our room we were greeted by two men,1
6955,listed breakfast but have no idea where it would have been the worst i've ever had to stay in a days inn ever again,1
6956,overall the place was a dump and i would never stay here again and do not recommend it,1
6957,i informed her that there was no one at the counter,1
6958,i asked if it was ocean and was told it couldn't be that bad,1

6962,we were told thatat the arrival that will be charged for a no show as well,1
6963,when i checked in i had to request that the room be cleaned and was told they would get them to me right away,1
6964,i wish i could get my money back because of bed bugs,1
6965,subsequently i learned there was a denny's across the street and they at least had security there,1
6966,we checked in even though initially they couldn't find the reservation on their end,1
6967,later in the day the only thing cleaned up was the hair on the sheets was a bit much for us,1
6968,this is the second worst hotel experience ever,1
6969,then when i went to the bathroom there was a puddle from the moment we walked in,1
6970,best place to stay at 11:00 at night when uploading kids and bags,1
6971,the mini-fridge was on the floor after the beds were made pull up the blanket over unmade bed,1

6974,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one set we had two rooms,1

6986,do not ever stay at this place again,1
6987,when i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1

6989,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
6990,elevator didn't work in the room the water wouldn't drain so we stood in ankle deep water was not pleasant,1

6997,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk they said someone would come look at it nobody showed up,1
6998,when i went on line to search for hotels and i looked at each other and decided maybe we needed to do that,1
6999,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
7000,i told him i was very disappointed for the cost of this room for one night using hotels,1

7009,there was big hole in the bathroom wall hair on the bed sheets and prostitution going on in the parking lot,1

7012,we could not open up the sofa bed because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,1
7013,the room was tiny and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
7014,that was the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
7015,had fun minty-green tile in the bathroom and everyday we had to go somewhere else,1
7016,thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room and the breakfast buffet had no protein,1
7017,i went to check out the room prior to the hotel staff who cared less when i addressed this,1
7018,we could hear every conversation from the room next to it i am pretty certain was being used for drug deals,1
7019,when we got to the hotel after the funeral and found the room had not been cleaned nor vacuumed in some time,1
7020,this hotel is being renovated and i was in a hurry to go to a local service station to get some,1
7021,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
7022,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
7023,i had a lot of stuff in my hands so when i checked in yet his staff claimed it wasn't there,1
7024,we did get a dirty bathroom a toilet i had to ask for them later that day,1

7035,the door to the bathroom was broken and the air conditioning wasn't working properly,1
7036,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1

7042,nothing great to recommend about this hotel and i had to check out without taking shower,1
7043,i am almost certain this happened in the room on asking it was told that maintenance is working on it,1
7044,well for starters my wife and i stayed at motel 6 in eloy az for 2 weeks,1
7045,the airport shuttle which was one of the poorest experiences i've had,1

7047,never stat at this hotel the place is run down old furniture not a very clean place,1
7048,i felt that should have been a much nicer hotel,1
7049,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed at,1
7050,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and the a c was too small to cool the entire room down,1
7051,first off let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a better location or better motel hotel,1
7052,we went down early and found this room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
7053,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
7054,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful,1
7055,no one said anything to them they took over this hotel for the indoor pool on the property to take our children,1
7056,will never stay at another comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
7057,unfortainatley there were people in out of the room and they could not fix the problem,1

7060,the staff was awful the owner came to my room banging on the door at 8 am and woke us up well before 12,1
7061,there was no one at the front desk did not seem to care that i was unhappy,1
7062,and the best i ask for a full refund was 20 minutes,1
7063,when we arrived there was no one at the counter,1
7064,there was a wad of hair on the floor and tons of live ones around,1
7065,the hotel reservation said it was a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
7066,i left the hotel and did not stay there because i was worried about bed bugs,1
7067,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
7068,i had ants in my room and it was cheap,1
7069,our toilet was broken and they said they did not have reservation and charged me for already paid stay,1
7070,when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the parking lot and yell at our group,1

7072,me and my family didn't even stay we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes,1
7073,the breakfast area was dirty and had hair on them,1
7074,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
7075,the location is marked clearly from the highway but no sign in front of the hotel at no cost which is rare at hotels in,1
7076,oh and did i mention housekeeping yells up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads,1
7077,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem very active or present,1
7078,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
7079,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building but this would put me a stones throw from the highway,1
7080,it was the cops being there all night trying to get rid of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
7081,because we got in so late there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
7082,also there were several stains all over the walls and bottom of the door where you could see outside,1
7083,i've stayed at a few super 8's in the past and even though they knew they still sold the room to us,1
7084,first of all the man at the front desk could not find my reservation then when i got to the room,1
7085,the place is huge well maintained from outside and right next to the lake which is what we were looking for,1
7086,but worse of all the were cigarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the bed and next to the bed,1
7087,i called the police and was told not there problem,1

7094,but we got no sleep cause they put us on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
7095,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front door did not bolt shut,1
7096,we had no problem looking him in the eye and said he inspected it himself,1
7097,it was very discussing they delayed our check in time because they said they were completely booked and could not do anything for us,1
7098,when i returned to my room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1

7100,it was like people lived there grill in the parking area in front of the pool,1
7101,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
7102,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
7103,entire building wing of the hotel smelled terrible and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1

7123,for the price we paid the hotel itself was very clean and quite nice,1
7124,nothing about this hotel is that it is not his fault,1
7125,the smell was so strong we kept the window open for fresh air,1
7126,i was disappointed in our room and the hotel told me they had none,1
7127,i'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't be considered a non-smoking room yet it still smelled really strong like smoke,1
7128,we left as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
7129,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
7130,there was no refrigerator in room and no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
7131,they said they have no other room and when we arrived there was urine in the toilet,1
7132,when we left in the morning many of them were still hanging out in the food area while they should have been cleaning our room,1
7133,i would never stay here again and will not recommend it to my worst enemy,1
7134,i tried to call the front desk they still charged me for the night,1
7135,after about 15 minutes no one showed up i had to call the staff to come take a look at one point,1
7136,there's a small light over the first light switch as you walk into the lobby there is an unpleasant smell,1
7137,first one didn't lock second didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally the shower,1
7138,bad house keeping we didn't get to stay in the towels wash cloth were old hard rough looking,1
7139,we should have read the reviews before booking and thought it couldn't be slept in,1
7140,i'm asking for my money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
7141,i went and asked for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
7142,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock there was one sheet on the bed and there were a few small holes also,1
7143,even though it was a non smoking room walked in it smelled like smoke even though it was all-inclusive,1
7144,the bathroom light was burned out the first night and charged my credit card twice,1
7145,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
7146,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the couch looks like something they,1
7147,this was a horrible stay we were able to park in the street across from the hotel room shook with truck noise and police pullovers,1
7148,the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into,1
7149,not the worst place i've stayed at this location many times,1
7150,i will never stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
7151,woke me up in the middle of the night so we finally realized that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
7152,the free breakfast was a joke stale food,1
7153,do not stay here it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
7154,i contacted hotels and asked to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for,1
7155,questioned him about how many people were in the room and the condition it was in and left,1
7156,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff are quite pleasant and helpful,1
7157,thankfully they gave me another room but i did not feel safe in this hotel and have negotiate with them 2 days before lodge,1
7158,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
7159,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
7160,then to top it all off they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
7161,the towels were paper thin and there were stains on the wall and a big hole in the wall very high up,1
7162,no one in my family got ready that morning and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
7163,will never stay there again please if you are a somewhat savvy traveler of large metropolitan cities,1
7164,my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back,1
7165,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
7166,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room,1
7167,the furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
7168,there was no phone in the room and we found what looked like dog poop on the side of the pool,1
7169,this was the worst hotel stay i have ever had in my life,1
7170,i do not recommend this place to nobody,1
7171,00 dinner just for the holiday bad food bad service and on top of that i could not get a third key 3,1
7172,it was half the price of most hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
7173,warning do not stay at this motel tell again if it wasn't an issue,1
7174,to my utter disgust the room was dirty and the floor was dirty and the floor was dirty,1
7175,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
7176,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned back,1
7177,i had to check out of the room immediatly and there were no other rooms available we would've left,1
7178,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
7179,we purchased a nice room with a balcony to be able to relax prior to the race,1
7180,went back downstairs and got a key to a different room cause the key card wouldn't work,1
7181,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were not very clean,1
7182,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
7183,the shower was broken the room wasn't too clean so only after a couple of hours we found a bedbug,1
7184,i was told they would not do anything about the frat like partying,1
7185,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to carry everything around with us,1
7186,budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and be sure to try the new pancake maker,1
7187,our walls and door looked like they had not been washed,1
7188,the mattress on the pull out bed had no sheets,1
7189,only reason why we stayed here is because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
7190,the bathroom floor counters looked like they had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
7191,however the room was a nice size and quiet,1
7192,the shower sprayed all over the place don't stay here,1
7193,i would not recomend anyone to stay there for less than a week,1
7194,she then asked if i wanted to stay in a days inn ever again,1
7195,i booked through hotels that she couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
7196,there was an instant odor as soon as you stepped off the elevator you gagged,1
7197,the towels were paper thin and there was no hot water for a shower,1
7198,it was the worst stay in a motel that i have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel complaining wimp,1
7199,i was afraid to walk on the bathroom floor in our previous room,1
7200,only motel that had an opening near oxford,1
7201,they advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in grand rapids we opted to stay here,1
7202,in fact everyone else we had dealings with at the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
7203,it was causing the heater to run all night and i woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies,1
7204,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and quite nice,1
7205,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
7206,there are no ice machines at this location and left immediately after seeing the room,1
7207,i had heard of places like this but i had no idea what there was to do in this town,1
7208,in early october i called this hotel directly and they said they had none to move us too,1
7209,we selected the hotel because of stuffy room,1
7210,a horrible hotel i will not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
7211,the lighting temperature were much darker colder than the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
7212,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and quickly move me to another room,1
7213,they said they have breakfast and they don't make hotel to be aware of it too,1
7214,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to carry my luggage to the third floor,1
7215,the hotel's structure is old and you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
7216,there were bugs in the bathroom window i found evidence of more dead bugs in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
7217,i reported it at the front desk was of little to no help,1
7218,it was so bad the sec i walked into the lobby to a curtain of,1
7219,the manager of the hotel was supposed to call me back and never did,1
7220,5 hours from portland oregon to miles city we were very tired so didn't push for a refund etc,1
7221,they said they have breakfast and they don't make hotel to be aware of it too,1
7222,but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
7223,there were lots of maintenance issues in the room holes in the walls and dirt around the edges of the bathroom,1
7224,we returned hours later around 10 pm and the smell was worse plus i could see shoe marks on the tile floor,1
7225,but we will never ever stay at that hotel again,1
7226,there were bugs in the room and told him that they didn't have any,1
7227,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to request an early check in,1
7228,not only was it dirty but the smell was not coming from the bathroom,1
7229,i reported it at the front desk could not find my reservation then when i got to the room,1
7230,i did check out early but because i had paid for it on expedia,1
7231,most disgusting room i've ever been to,1
7232,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the front desk however the experience quickly changed for the,1
7233,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed and there were no sighting of any bedbugs there,1
7234,the only thing good about this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever had,1
7235,it was very dirty and the shower was very dirty,1
7236,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience ever,1
7237,i was so sick the next morning i had already fallen asleep,1
7238,the room was tiny and the front desk said there was nothing she could do,1
7239,as we walked up the stairs to our room we were moved out of the room next door all night imagine my surprise when i,1
7240,the pool looked cloudy so my children didn't have the energy to continue the day's journey,1
7241,warning do not stay at this motel tell again if it was my last resort,1
7242,if you ever go to the front desk as i was in a rush and i didn't even bother cleaning the room for us,1
7243,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room and started to close the door didn't work either,1
7244,i did finally take a look at the neighborhood where the hotel is,1
7245,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
7246,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet so we change it,1
7247,manager came in at 6 am when i asked for a queen bed and said i had to change rooms first day,1
7248,terrible first off some one came into my room while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
7249,i knew this was going to be a very friendly place,1
7250,we asked for a different room at early check in and was told it was on the beach,1
7251,we had booked this hotel through southwest airlines and when we arrived the attendant was standing outside smoking,1
7252,it's my policy to never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel was incredibly brief,1
7253,i very strongly recommend that no one their right mind would ever stay at this hotel dirty unsafe very bad hotel staff was bad,1
7254,but other than that this hotel was a former baymont inn that has not been renovated or keep up since except the obnoxious color outside,1
7255,have been to prescott valley several times and have wanted to stay at this comfort inn based on the reviews i read,1
7256,would not recommend this hotel my wife had to go to another hotel,1
7257,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
7258,she didn't offer to move me and was told there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
7259,i called the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to think much of that despite the smoke aggravating my respiratory issues,1
7260,i called customer service from the parking lot and yell at our group,1
7261,cheap hotel for a one night stay at your hotel sept,1
7262,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to carry my luggage to the third floor,1
7263,the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked up in the hallway,1
7264,when we went to the front desk were nothing short of astonishing,1
7265,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk did not do anything about it and would not speech to him,1
7266,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was not much better,1
7267,the room was clean even though we had a non smoking room,1
7268,this was by far the dirtiest place i have ever walked into in my life,1
7269,it was the worst hotel we have stayed in americ inn before in another state,1
7270,i discovered one wasn't plugged in and there was no attempt to fix it,1
7271,one of our employees got bed bug bites and we had to open the door to outside surprised they could afford the chlorine,1
7272,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
7273,request smoking received non smoking i will not recommend this hotel to anyone nor would i stay here again,1
7274,well i couldnt afford a hotel for the night so i got a room that was booked the next night,1
7275,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
7276,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
7277,horrible experience for my family and i stayed at this hotel,1
7278,we went and asked to be let in,1
7279,its very unfortunate that a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
7280,again things happen but every time we would go in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
7281,i would not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
7282,when i got to the room it was disgusting,1
7283,the windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
7284,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
7285,so gross will never stay again or recommend,1
7286,the computer in the business center was so old it was hardened in the little containers,1
7287,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
7288,the hotel was so sketchy that i could not stand to be in the condo,1
7289,99 price they have posted on the highway and reasonably priced which were our main points for selection,1
7290,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
7291,pool closed hole in the wall and the shower was very dirty,1
7292,we were told that the manager would call us in the morning and our flight had landed hours late and we were overtired,1
7293,when we arrived florida we were supposed to have a nonsmoking room,1
7294,will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
7295,we should have left but tried sticking it out for a new one and that also did not work,1
7296,the smell was so bad i didn't stay,1
7297,i was getting ready to take a shower and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
7298,there was no air on in the so the we had to leave or they were calling the cops,1
7299,the second day i guess because they didn't even have sheets on it,1
7300,unfortunately that was not the case this time,1
7301,on top of that i could not get my money back because of the no refund thing,1
7302,all 5 of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price and this was the worst experience of my life,1
7303,there are 2 hotels right across the street from the wedding site so we decided to try it,1
7304,this trip was horrible becouse of this hotel and roaches in our room i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,1
7305,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
7306,we couldn't wait to leave and thankful i was only in possession of the room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
7307,will not stay at a hotel like this,1
7308,i had trouble requesting a non-smoking room but the entire first floor smelled of cigarettes and something else,1
7309,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
7310,staff goofed up our billing resulting in an hour and a half for our room at check in,1
7311,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
7312,worst hotel i've ever checked in to when i got into the room it was supposed to be a non smoking room,1
7313,they would not give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
7314,not enough towels and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me on the phone,1
7315,toilet was overflowing when we got there and the hotel was sold out,1
7316,arriving back at my room at the end of my stay for the upgrade,1
7317,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room each time i left,1
7318,if you frequent hostels and don't have trouble with the train,1
7319,out of 5 hotels we stayed in this was the most horrible experience i have never experienced at a hotel,1
7320,upon arrival the first thing we noticed was it was not a clean surface in the room,1
7321,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time ever i had numerous bites and an allergic reaction to something,1
7322,they had to give me a refund i had to go and ask for towels,1
7323,when we got to the room it's filthy and needs a lot of work,1
7324,the staff is extremely creepy and made us feel like we were racially profiled,1
7325,the worst check out tuesday went to a different hotel that is how dirty this hotel was,1
7326,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor,1
7327,we had no wash clothes in our room and when they arrived there was animal hair on them,1
7328,the plumbing was so bad that i booked 2 nights at sheraton hotel for business meetings,1
7329,i wanted to call the front desk and they never fixed it,1
7330,we paid 300 for two nights my boyfriend and i had previously stayed her three years ago and had a wonderful stay,1
7331,if this place had bed bugs it would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
7332,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
7333,the blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was supposly a non smoking room,1
7334,after i checked in i went to my room keys didn't work,1
7335,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care or was concerned,1
7336,worst hotel i have ever been to the place is old scary and dirty,1
7337,if you placed your head in the skylight on the other side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
7338,the hotel front desk monday afternoon asking me when i was checking out i have to wait at least five to seven additional days,1
7339,i called back and the front desk guy over an hour to get checked in,1
7340,did not stay after checking in and entering the room we realized it was a basic hotel with basic amenities,1
7341,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go back and find my second room,1
7342,i just happened into this place i was please with the looks on the outside the lobby and how the staff is,1
7343,the last straw was that the room had a small table with two chairs,1
7344,the food is good for woodfire pizza's but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
7345,we were two families staying in this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
7346,the room had a bad smell to it and the door was not sealed and the sunlight came in long with the heat,1
7347,went back got a key for another room this room had a broken dryer dirty sheets and was in disrepair,1
7348,so i cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
7349,even the lobby had a funny smell and the room was filled with marianas smell,1
7350,the hallway on the second floor and as soon as we entered the office we should have turned around and left,1
7351,i would definately not dear to stay at this hotel it's disgusting in every sense,1
7352,i'm glad our room was at the another end of the building,1
7353,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
7354,the carpets were dirty both in the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
7355,we booked this hotel because i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
7356,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
7357,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
7358,the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
7359,but the good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
7360,budget-minded travelers appreciate amenities like complimentary breakfast buffet and be sure to try the new pancake maker,1
7361,of course its not their fault call expedia,1
7362,the hotel was very dirty our rooms were filthy as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
7363,manager of hotel notified and i was told he couldn't do anything and i would need to contact them,1
7364,we did not ask to be moved for it was late and no sophisticated menu was available,1
7365,had to constantly kill them when i was in the pet room and said she probably wouldn't stay there,1
7366,find a better hotel for the money you pay the breakfast is veryour poor,1
7367,the carpet had rips all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
7368,and the best i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to check out alone and deal with this,1
7369,they had no one available to look at it at 10 the next day,1
7370,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this hotel was perfectly located,1
7371,there were roaches in the room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
7372,we were told that it would be a decent place to stay between a and b but not recommended for a long stay,1
7373,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
7374,she gave me a key to a different room,1
7375,i will definitely never stay at this hotel the staff is horrible and the rooms are outdated dark and dank,1
7376,it's a hole that i was forced to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
7377,also they could add additional fee that i did not know tried to follow me into my room one night,1
7378,i marched down to the office to file a complaint and asked for a refund if it wasn't to late,1
7379,went i to our room and there was hair the shower had someone else's hair on it,1
7380,was moved to another room the shower was broken the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out during check-in,1
7381,and finally we went down to the front desk for twenty minutes while we waited to check in and,1
7382,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
7383,i stayed at the country inn and suites is now under new owners,1
7384,we were in town for one night for a wedding and the party staying there i would've gone somewhere else,1
7385,she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm,1
7386,they did not switch me rooms as they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
7387,got the feeling that they were aware of the bed bugs we brought home from here,1
7388,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was even cracked,1
7389,call the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a future credit but thise jerks wanted their extra 20,1
7390,no one would talk to us and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid through expedia,1
7391,the room i was placed in they then put me in another room that had no issues with water,1
7392,i called back one more time and the front desk guy was always on the phone,1
7393,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the front desk had a hard time getting it back,1
7394,room looked like it has not been updated since the eighties,1
7395,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't have the courage to try,1
7396,this place is absolutely the worst hospitality experience that i have ever had in my life,1
7397,the place is nothing like the pictures on line terrible hotel,1
7398,no heat on friday and no do not disturb sign on the door when we entered,1
7399,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
7400,this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of months for more towels and that they just ignore their requests,1
7401,we asked for a different room at early check in and was told it was an extra 30 per night,1
7402,only to find they didn't have any key cards so i had to choose between a hot or cold shower,1
7403,i gave them my reservation number for the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
7404,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
7405,i'm not sure all esa work the same way but this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
7406,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned back,1
7407,we were told that the room would smell,1
7408,when i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
7409,it is not a safe place to stay,1
7410,i had a business meeting that i had to so i can review,1
7411,1st night awakened by call from my cell phone to let them know about this but no response,1
7412,i asked for a non smoking room as i did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids,1
7413,in recent years my wife and i checked in late at 11 pm and i checked out at midnight and they kept my money,1
7414,i booked this hotel because i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
7415,we payed for 3 people but they said they would get someone to look at it at 10 the next day,1
7416,i was not offered another room but rather told to let the water run for about 10 minutes until i asked if something was wrong,1
7417,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms booked,1
7418,when i checked in i had to request that the room be cleaned and was told they have no audio,1
7419,i couldn't wait to get out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
7420,not to mention the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
7421,i never felt safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty,1
7422,this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
7423,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1
7424,when we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk had a very unkept shady atmosphere about it,1
7425,we booked this hotel because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
7426,this has to be the worst hotel experience we have had,1
7427,the one thing we asked for and didn't get to the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
7428,i was in a rush and i didn't know that on the weekends the hotel becomes a free for all,1
7429,we cancelled as soon as we woke up,1
7430,besides the foul unusual smell in the hotel room as well as in the shower,1
7431,we drove by the hotel 6 across the street and a chevron across the parking lot with their luggage,1
7432,i called this hotel directly and they said they had none to move us too,1
7433,we're working on trying to get our money back simply because this experience is not what we paid for the night,1
7434,however the owner manager was very rude and inconsiderate she proceeded to tell me,1
7435,first of all the pictures of the property are not true,1
7436,the other comforter had seamen stains all over it and down in to the cushion,1
7437,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
7438,when we called front desk to mention this,1
7439,the shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very helpful and said i see that you canceled but i,1
7440,there was an instant odor as soon as you stepped off the elevator you gagged,1
7441,she was very nice when i called down to the receptionist and asked can i have to towels,1
7442,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute getaway before returning school and work,1
7443,watered down waffle mix apple juice and orange juice it looked like it was barely touched by house keeping,1
7444,i called back one more time and the front desk person didn't try to help me at all,1
7445,the entire first floor smelled of smoke even though we had air conditioner appeared that was not working correctly,1
7446,she said she had to pay the maid to clean the room neighbors are very loud to all hrs of the night,1
7447,it wasn't the hypodermic needle in the parking lot and cops at the reception desk,1
7448,the woman at the front desk was very friendly but that's about it,1
7449,would not recommend it to my dog to stay with us and there was a bit of a disappointment and literally,1
7450,go back to the front office but they wouldn't do anything about it so the,1
7451,my suite door look like it hadn't been cleaned in years,1
7452,for that reason i will not recommend or stay here again,1
7453,room smelled like sewer and called front desk and they did send a repair man right over,1
7454,exhausted after driving 10 hours my son and i were an 8500 mile road trip across the us,1
7455,never plan on driving to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
7456,my tv in the room had a strong odor of cleaning supplies,1
7457,when we walked in the staff was very courteous and helpful,1
7458,we are happy having a clean room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room,1
7459,the hotel was very dirty our rooms were filthy as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
7460,i stay at hampton inn's all the time and this was the worst motel room i've ever stayed at,1
7461,well the next day we found out that the air wasn't working,1
7462,gave us a room that had a extra tv on the floor and in the tub,1
7463,then we get to the room and closed it again,1
7464,i was never so happy to check out of the room next door all night imagine my surprise when i,1
7465,the air conditioner was small and in a hole in the wall no lock on the bathroom door from a previous guest,1
7466,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
7467,the third floor smelled of smoke even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
7468,the reservation was wrong and i had to search for another one in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
7469,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
7470,it was the worst stay in a motel that i have ever had lot of weird people on drugs hanging outside in parking lot,1
7471,the rooms are clean but the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
7472,but worse of all the were cigarette buds on the floor next to the bed and next to the mirror over the sink,1
7473,we should have read the reviews before i made my reservation,1
7474,they advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in grand rapids we opted to stay here,1
7475,i was desperate for a room i would have left immediately but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck,1
7476,the telephone in our room didn't work,1
7477,it started with the games regarding the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms,1
7478,first one didn't lock second didn't have a place to stay for the night,1
7479,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
7480,she wouldnt give her name so sorry i dont know how its even aloud to keep this hotel running,1
7481,the hotel had an odd smell to it,1
7482,i asked 2 times towels and heck the ac is not working they never came to fix it they just removed it,1
7483,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls did not match,1
7484,i booked one room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
7485,i request my money back and they said i would have to wait until the next day,1
7486,so i called the front desk to unclog the toilet and the sink had plumbing problems and they ran all night long,1
7487,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
7488,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
7489,i was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
7490,when we complained and asked for a different room they said they were gon na treat the room,1
7491,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and nice,1
7492,there were no towels so i called down to the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself,1
7493,a blowtorch would be a good place to leave your dog i guess,1
7494,when i got to the door of the room i was placed in they then put me in another room,1
7495,i do not recommend this hotel to anyone whatsoever there was a lot of strangers walking in out,1
7496,i asked her why you don't have a problem with is loud construction going on during the stay,1
7497,got to the room it's filthy and needs a lot of work,1
7498,not one good thing about this hotel is that it is not that far from there,1
7499,gang graffiti in the room on our first night rude rude and rude,1
7500,we did not stay at the hotel because of stuffy room,1
7501,we also did not feel safe with just the locks on the screen doors didn't work,1
7502,we stayed there friday through sunday for a wrestling tournament and there is a good reason why,1
7503,the place was filthy and i would never stay here again,1
7504,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
7505,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
7506,the rugs are dirty and when we took a shower the towel ripped while he was drying himself off,1
7507,only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step,1
7508,many of the lights didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in,1
7509,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
7510,when asked to speak to the owner about the check-in is a zoo,1
7511,this is the part of the staff here,1
7512,why would people lie about the comments and rating anyway the place was a dump and i would never go back again,1
7513,when brought up to the front desk and the phone did not work,1
7514,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and get to the elevator,1
7515,it was such a bad hotel in a bad area not horrible and the hotel room was 85 degrees and very musty,1
7516,i went and told the man at the front desk that nothing could be done until the morning,1
7517,to its credit at least the lobby and hallways had a strong odor and the sheets were worn thin,1
7518,me and my family didn't even stay there because it disgusting,1
7519,not worth staying at this hotel and they were not queen size as advertised,1
7520,the whole building and the room reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was stained,1
7521,six out of eight people were in the room and in the hallways until after 4 am,1
7522,the people at the front desk checking out,1
7523,i dont recommend this hotel to my worst enemy,1
7524,as i walked upstairs to go to my room on a hilton honors floor,1
7525,the staff told us there was nothing they could do because i booked my room online i was given a non smoking room,1
7526,i finally attempted to use the shower and the tub would take forever to drain,1
7527,to its credit at least the lobby and hallways had a strong odor and the sheets were worn thin,1
7528,during the beginning check in everything looked very quaint and as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
7529,we figured that it was a non smoking room but the,1
7530,i had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was much better but is now really run down,1
7531,i have reason to visit rohnert park often but will never stay here or another days inn again,1
7532,the whole building and the room reeked of cigarette smoke and it did not have central air conditioning,1
7533,the whole building and the room reeked of pot and smoke even though it was only around 3 pm and they could have,1
7534,i will say the staff was very friendly and apologetic hotel put 700,1
7535,when i have a reservation for a 3 day stay at this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
7536,first let me say that i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
7537,where do i start it wasn't the hypodermic needle in the parking lot directly in front of the door,1
7538,guess they were not happy with our stay,1
7539,this room had a used towel on the chair bed was not made again moved to another room,1
7540,i should get a refund it was so bad i didn't stay the other night and i went to marriot hotel,1
7541,i will not come to this facility again i do not recommend anyone to support or subject themselves to these conditions,1
7542,i stayed in this room because it was just across the street from one another at this exit,1
7543,i called tuesday morning to speak with the manager and she seemed to have no care,1
7544,if it wasn't late on a friday afternoon after a long drive and had to wait till 4 pm,1
7545,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
7546,it was a very bad experience me and my family will not stay in a days inn ever again,1
7547,swimming pool was very cold so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
7548,this was the worst hotel stay both my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room i just cried,1
7549,we had our family reunion there and it was a hotel i would be scared to stay in,1
7550,our internet would not stay connected at all we tried and tried to get us to cancel with hotels and then pay them direct,1
7551,unfortunately i was not able cause the wall behind it will move back,1
7552,ironically the inside of the hotel is beautiful and luxurious just as expected,1
7553,in early october i called this hotel directly and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
7554,we put a tip on the bed and there were no rooms available,1
7555,the smell appearance and condition of the room was never clean,1
7556,they said they were completely booked and could not do anything for us,1
7557,we will pitch a tent on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
7558,it was so hot in the bathroom because there was no record of my card ever being swiped,1
7559,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager he made acusations that the beer cans were mine,1
7560,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
7561,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
7562,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel,1
7563,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
7564,we had a late check-in due to a wedding and when we got in the room and acknowledge the problem,1
7565,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
7566,after complaining to the manager she did apologize and gave me a print out showing we didn't stay terrible location,1
7567,yet it looked more like she was preparing for bed and did not want to even shower in it the next morning,1
7568,the hotel facility is old and there is a swim park next door,1
7569,so after i woke up i found there were no towels and when,1
7570,who runs a business like this when they found a room we were given had a king and a sofa bed,1
7571,it wasn't made and the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
7572,the carpets were dirty and needed maintenance,1
7573,i stay at hampton inn's all the time and this was the only hotel room available in town that night,1
7574,the room was tiny and the front desk staff was extremely nice as well,1
7575,that was horrible experience i wish i could have stayed at any hotel and chose this one,1
7576,she did not tell me till the next morning i think next time i,1
7577,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
7578,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
7579,extremely disappointed in wyndham and should get our money back and they said the hotel had a strange odor,1
7580,the hilton location is great but the hotel was the very nice desk clerk at check-in,1
7581,we both woke up in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
7582,no tv in the room had an odd smell to it,1
7583,the ac heater was so loud when running it was difficult to sleep because i could hear everything,1
7584,shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up,1
7585,the lady julene at the desk was not very friendly,1
7586,the room was tiny and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
7587,clearly the hotel is trying very hard to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel,1
7588,it is not only an older facility but reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on the sheets pillos and carpet,1
7589,the only thing good about this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed had no sheets,1
7590,i had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was much better but is now really run down,1
7591,i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one is the worst i've seen,1
7592,since it was late we could not get another room until the next day we look at our account and they charged our card,1
7593,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
7594,it was the worst experience i have had in years,1
7595,please stay away until the construction is completed at the end of the building and my room was switched twice,1
7596,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
7597,then the room was trashing one of the beds and had to take the spread off,1
7598,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
7599,the fluorescent bulb above the vanity was missing and the desk lamp did not work lights above mirror were barely noticeable,1
7600,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a worse experience,1
7601,there were no towels in the bathroom and god the list could go on,1
7602,the shower in the master bath did not work and nobody at the place seemed to know anything,1
7603,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights,1
7604,the ac unit was coming out of the room next to us with both at a much cheaper rate,1
7605,the ceiling above the shower looked as if it was unused for a year or more,1
7606,and the room had a bad odor and the air conditioning didn't work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
7607,the room was dingy and unclean and the bed was very comfortable but that's all i heard from them,1
7608,to the point where i can't believe these can get away with this,1
7609,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms,1
7610,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
7611,hard lesson learn get what you pay for and it was not on the website,1
7612,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms,1
7613,he finally gave us a non-smoking room had cigarette burns on them,1
7614,they have a free shuttle service but it is not very secure people come in and out of the place,1
7615,we already moved rooms once and were told that they had not gotten to us yet,1
7616,the walls only went half way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
7617,she was not welcoming nor helpful when we asked for help and the front desk receptionist accidentally hung up on me,1
7618,this property is not worth the high price we paid,1
7619,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
7620,we checked into the hotel and when i went to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
7621,they literally are falling apart and very dirty,1
7622,at that point we checked out because we did not have a relaxing stay,1
7623,internet was very slow and most of the time so if you don't stay,1
7624,needless to say i am never going to stay there again on our same business trip,1
7625,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
7626,i arrived late and the receptionist insisted that i did not even though i had already paid,1
7627,woke up to no hot water for our entire stay,1
7628,we were told we would not get a refund because it's a third party billing and i'm not talking about any luxury,1
7629,when i tried to check in at 12 in the morning because this place is horrible,1
7630,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of minutes barefoot or with socks left feet or socks black,1
7631,it is not very secure people come in and out of and used the stairs as to avoid lobby and elevator,1
7632,they literally are falling apart and very dirty,1
7633,we went and asked to be let in,1
7634,had nowhere else to go otherwise i would have left immediately but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck,1
7635,the hairdryer was barely on the wall and a big hole in the bathroom wall hair on the bed sheets lamp shade and curtains,1
7636,went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,1
7637,it was 20 degrees and the door to the stairs across from,1
7638,no apology for the conditions of the rooms was stinking so badly that we had to get out and let other people have the pool,1
7639,will not ever be coming back to this place and it shouldn't be considered a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
7640,no standrd amenities provided no shampoo expensive pool closes early wifi doesnt work ask them to check it never called back,1
7641,called 2 hours before checking in and still had to wait an hour to be put in another room,1
7642,we had multiple rooms in this hotel and i had to change rooms,1
7643,this used to be a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
7644,call the front desk but were told no other rooms were available and didn't try to help the situation at all,1
7645,the location is out in the middle of july than it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
7646,we were very disappointed with our stay at the motel was simply unbelievable,1
7647,asked for a non smoking room and the room itself was tiny,1
7648,ironically the inside of the room was horrible,1
7649,the windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything in the ajoining room and from the upstairs room,1
7650,the smoking odor was outrageous and even the non smoking room smelled like smoke even though it was a room for the night,1
7651,i would not recommend someone to stay at that hotel and i will never stay at another guest house and not recommend it to anyone,1
7652,plus the rooms we booked and paid for but it was midnight and we were tired but we will not stay there again,1
7653,breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend any family stay at this hotel unless you smoked,1
7654,i realize it is a cheap hotel not a hostel,1
7655,we felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay there again for complete lack of any amenities,1
7656,we went to go look at her room it had not been used in many years and like smoke,1
7657,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care about his job what so ever,1
7658,when we asked to talked to a manager then she gave us a double bed room filled with spiderwebs and recently bursted spider eggs,1
7659,we told them fine but we were not going to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
7660,i asked about changing rooms and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day,1
7661,lobby and entrance smelled terrible and was musty and moldy,1
7662,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
7663,let me just say i will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
7664,it is their job to make sure it was the right room woke everyone up and didn't even shut and latch,1
7665,i would not stay here if you don't mind fleas and unclean sheets,1
7666,the manager picked up and said she had left for the day at about 10 am,1
7667,the walk way on the third floor and the elevator sounded like it was on its last legs,1
7668,but other than that this hotel was a former baymont inn that has not been renovated or keep up since except the obnoxious color outside,1
7669,they don't inform you about this problem before and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
7670,he kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not feel safe with just the locks on the door,1
7671,i was given a handicap room that i didn't have a single craft beer,1
7672,water did not come out of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
7673,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
7674,the curtain rod was held up in the middle of august you need the ac,1
7675,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management at this hotel is it only charged 10,1
7676,black mold on the shower curtain the shower curtain would not close all the way so we jimmy'd the lock with the key,1
7677,the extra fee for a double room had been paid but the manager refused to talk to us even after two calls,1
7678,this was by far the worst hotel i ever been,1
7679,yes i get that there was a big problem in our room and service,1
7680,went back downstairs and front desk gave me a late check out after i agree to pay 75,1
7681,the lift made me laugh it wasn't even a flat screen tv,1
7682,my room despite being told it was a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
7683,thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room and the tv remote needed batteries,1
7684,first off when i booked my room two days in advance,1
7685,the motel also is aaa approved so if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
7686,my trip to sd was cancelled at the last minute during week of the masters,1
7687,it's sad because the front desk staff got it wrong first reason was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
7688,beware all 3 of us did not stay here after looking at two rooms that were both filthy,1
7689,i didn't even stay we had to go get them dresser had diapers in drawer,1
7690,we were up for a family reunion i will never ever go there,1
7691,after the cold night i went to take a shower i turned on the microwave the heater ain't work,1
7692,the staff were very rude when they came to fix it they just removed it,1
7693,my wife and i stayed at this hotel and i had to bring stroller all the time,1
7694,the rooms are very nice as well and the ac unit didn't seem to care hotel gave us a 25,1
7695,in my room the furniture was old outdated and it smelled,1
7696,in the future i much rather sleep in my car before i'd spend the night here again,1
7697,the lady at the front desk we were directed to drive around to the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
7698,i looked for the ac and tried to turn it on with the knob u had to turn it on and off under the sink,1
7699,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed had no sheets,1
7700,cops were banging on our door at 3 am and asked to be let in,1
7701,also we had toilet issues in our roomm which we had to pay a hotel for our stay and take care of the toilet ourselved,1
7702,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of august you need the ac,1
7703,it is not only an older facility but reeks of stale cigarette smoke there were stains on it,1
7704,this hotel motel is not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
7705,casino was fine but i will never book with chain again,1
7706,we left as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
7707,we checked in and went to my room to clean my room,1
7708,fiesta inn and suits should not be on hotels until they have better conditions,1
7709,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but was just too out of it,1
7710,but the only amenities this place had was a laundry room the continental breakfast was only cereal toast waffles coffee milk oj,1
7711,sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get checked in get ready and go to the function,1
7712,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and lots of dirt and hair of the previous occupant,1
7713,called the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to be replaced but rather refolded and put back,1
7714,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
7715,cleanliness was certainly questionable non smoking room with cigarette burns in the bedding and on toilet seat,1
7716,i was surprised when i checked the bed in the new room was broken,1
7717,the 1st room i got had no air conditioning and the bathroom was clean,1
7718,the front desk charged me 250 dollars and said it was because i was tired of being disappointed by each single one,1
7719,so gross will never stay again or recommend,1

7906,i have stayed here i never had a single apology from the hotel staff,1
7907,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
7908,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
7909,you won't need a car when you stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1

7952,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
7953,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
7954,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1

7968,we already moved rooms once and were told that they were pet friendly,1
7969,internet was very slow and most of the time and service varies from terrible to nonexistent,1
7970,i have reason to visit rohnert park often but will never stay here or another days inn again,1
7971,i should have known the rooms would have been disgusting by the smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins,1
7972,the lobby was being used for drug deals,1

7974,went back got a key for another room this room had a broken dryer dirty sheets and was in disrepair,1
7975,the hotel is old and dirty in the room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
7976,i would never recommend this hotel to my worst enemy,1
7977,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night long,1

7982,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
7983,the place was filthy and there were holes in the walls and carpeting,1
7984,i think this was an old run down motel that reaked of mold from the moment you get to the lobby and cancelled,1
7985,the only good thing about this hotel is it felt dirty unsafe and it smelt funny,1
7986,we were able to catch them just in time so that we could pass on the narrow balcony to get to our room,1
7987,cheap hotel for a one night stay on september 12,1
7988,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
7989,we had just finished a 6 hr drive and were rushed out of the room immediatly and there were no rooms available around the area,1
7990,it worked all right we had to stay in this room and even though it stunk we decided to keep this room,1
7991,first night when checked in assigned room was not made again no towels ac was not working and dirty,1
7992,the best thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
7993,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of time square but the rooms are not well kept,1
7994,this is the second worst hotel motel i've ever heard of,1

7997,the reservation was wrong and i had to be moved along with other furniture to be useful,1

8007,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1

8017,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is quiet and the breakfast was terrible,1
8018,we had reservations for 2 nights and couldn't get anything right,1
8019,unsafe the complex is low income housing on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
8020,i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is the first bad review that i have given a hotel,1
8021,we both woke up in the morning with a credit soooooo helpful,1
8022,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
8023,when they discovered their mistake there wasn't even a trash bin in the bathroom,1
8024,this has to be the worst hotel experience i have ever had in my life,1
8025,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
8026,i could not find ice machine i walked around the entire hotel completely empty rooms windows wide open,1
8027,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
8028,the walls and remainder of the room were literally falling apart,1
8029,tired i decided to stay at this hotel it's disgusting in every sense,1
8030,once i got my key went into the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
8031,let me start off the 1st room they gave us had only one bed,1
8032,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
8033,we live out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room that had double beds,1
8034,i checked in requesting a non smoking room but the entire first floor was closed,1
8035,the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in years,1
8036,the sink in the new room was warm but nothing special,1
8037,this is the worst hotel that i have stayed in the was the worst,1
8038,way over priced for such a bad hotel in a bad area not horrible and the hotel room was disgusting,1
8039,they put ear plugs in the room and the condition it was in and left,1
8040,should have stayed in the car but it was too late as we arrived around 10 pm,1
8041,room was beyond shabby beds did not have a weapon so i was not shot,1
8042,we paid 300 for two nights my boyfriend and i were in town for a music festival so this hotel and others were pretty booked,1
8043,open your blinds stand upon the heater in the room was very dirty,1
8044,upon arriving at the front desk didn't,1
8045,she didn't offer to move me and was told there were no other rooms available slept with my clothes on,1
8046,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and one had a worse experience,1
8047,when i checked in i was told there would be in room champagne delivered,1
8048,we could not open up the sofa bed because it was so filthy it was not at all a good stay,1
8049,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
8050,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
8051,this is about the worse place i have ever layed my head down for the night,1
8052,people were standing outside of my room and they could have easily re-sold the room and probably did,1
8053,i've stayed in some crummy hotels but this one is the worst i've ever stayed in,1
8054,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the room was clean yet very worn,1
8055,the air did not work so drove walked to front desk and they said they had none to move us too,1
8056,after the cold night i went to take a shower i turned on the shower i could smell some kind of chemical from the drain,1
8057,they were unprofessional and walked into our room unannounced while we were dressing,1
8058,to our surprise the hotel was under renovation and the entire first floor smelled of smoke,1
8059,cops were banging on our door at 3 am and asked to be switched to another room whose ac didn't work,1
8060,ironing board did not work shower curtain would not close all the way so security was a joke,1
8061,i will not be staying at this hotel and i will never recommend it for anyone either,1
8062,bed uncomfortable and the middle of the night and personnel do not want to get in it,1
8063,when i called front desk and they gave me a new set,1
8064,the hotel needs a serious renovation and pest control it is not worth the time or money to stay at,1
8065,booked king room with handicap assessability for my parents and they ended up with a smoking room when we came in,1
8066,the rooms were filthy sheets were dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed with no blankets,1
8067,overall i would not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on my experience the prior year,1
8068,the next day we checked into the hotel and everything looked like it was not very costly but i would have been more comfortable,1
8069,i pulled in at 1 am with two small children i simply had no choice,1
8070,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
8071,i informed her that there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and i ended up getting bit up by bed bugs,1
8072,the location is out in the middle of these two giant corporations,1
8073,then we tried to use the bathroom and the smell was covered up by the comforter,1
8074,this is the part of the staff here,1
8075,after i checked in i had to clean my own room up,1
8076,thank goodness there was a denny's across the street and they at least had security there,1
8077,got a smoking room when we came in,1
8078,i would never return or recommend this place to anyone unless it was just an overnighter,1
8079,furniture in the room old and outdated but it is not accessible to wheelchair users and they don't care,1
8080,i called back and the assistant manager picked up and said oh yes mr,1
8081,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to open the window to try to air out the room,1
8082,1st night awakened by call from my cell phone to let them know about this but no response,1
8083,the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
8084,99 price they have posted on the highway and reasonably priced which were our main points for selection,1
8085,i wouldn't even recommend for a last minute room at 1 am,1
8086,when i inquired as to why i was told sorry there is no other rooms available,1
8087,what a bargain right when we arrived we went to the front desk and told them there was a big golf tournament that weekend,1
8088,this place should be shut down and demolished,1
8089,the service is what you would expect from a super 8,1
8090,m even i had a do not disturb sign to find that the cleaning,1
8091,when i got in the room there was a bad stale musty odor,1
8092,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
8093,we informed staff but there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
8094,i called the front desk and have someone come right up to my room to find the toilet clogged with toilet paper and poop,1
8095,it was finally changed after the second request in which the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name,1
8096,do not stay here it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier,1
8097,while i understand that the hotel staff didn't seem to care about anything,1
8098,they had no one available to look at it they already had it on the bedroom,1
8099,instead i was sent all the way to the pool all day long,1
8100,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and well-kept,1
8101,this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of hours in the room we found cold showers awaiting us,1
8102,there are tons of hotels motels around the country and this was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in,1
8103,also we had toilet issues in our roomm which we had to use to get to our room,1
8104,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
8105,do not stay here it looked like drug deals and boomers in the parking lot very late making tons of noise,1
8106,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking,1
8107,beer cans shoved under the bed when i reported this to the front desk and they said they had security to watch ha,1
8108,this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information,1
8109,one little ceiling bulb in the middle of the night scaring my family,1
8110,if we weren't so tired and the room was decent,1
8111,we had to keep the window open for fresh air,1
8112,why she thought that when all our stuff was in tact in the new room,1
8113,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most disguisting motel that i have ever been in,1
8114,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
8115,as a reply to this note i was told that i did not even want to take my shoes off in the room,1
8116,if it was not for us driving all day and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
8117,the paint in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock was right by the head of the bed,1
8118,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
8119,also they could add additional fee that i did not want to be charged for another night since we were canceling our reservation,1
8120,i had confirmation for 2 nights and couldn't get anything right,1
8121,it was late i need a place to crash for one night during our long drive,1
8122,had an attitude like she didn't want to refund me so i could stay elsewhere,1
8123,they did reimburse the cost of the hotel we were greeted by the smell of the room worst part it penetrates through all your belongins,1
8124,got a non-smoking room the rest of the hotel could use some updates,1
8125,we then went to dinner and when we got in the room there was a terrible smell,1
8126,it is not a safe place to stay,1
8127,i was staying with a large group and it was the worst experience of my life,1
8128,kids out of control staff does nothing and mold in shower never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel,1
8129,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and i had to check out alone and deal with this,1
8130,there we no trash cans in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get either dat that we stayed,1
8131,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
8132,website and book in room said there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not,1

8144,room smelled so strongly like urine we had to go get another key as the key never worked,1

8312,we should have read the reviews before i made my reservation,1
8313,we needed separate beds and the room we were supposed to have a nonsmoking room,1
8314,the room was dingy and unclean and the bed was like sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable,1
8315,unfortunately my stay was not pleasant we were put in another room the maid made sure mostly things were clean,1
8316,the door looked like it hadn't been cleaned at all,1
8317,when we checked in they gave us a room at the other side so he moved to be closer to them,1
8318,staff was apologetic and kind but i will never stay again as a diamond hilton member,1

8320,took a long time before we found out it was the heater and told them,1
8321,the room was dirty and the shower wasnt clean,1
8322,again i was in a rush and i didn't know any hotel only had showers in rooms,1
8323,smelled musty shower floor had what looked like condemnations notices on the doors,1
8324,our internet would not stay connected at all we tried and tried to get us to cancel with hotels and then pay them direct,1
8325,we had a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
8326,they said that was the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
8327,as the title suggests i'd have been better off to weather the storm,1
8328,and the pool looked decent even though we did not stay at this location again,1
8329,those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved but was told there are only so many rooms available,1
8330,the room was oaky but i will never stay here again and the board of health,1
8331,the whole building and the room reeked of cigarette smoke and it did not have central air conditioning,1
8332,it was not worth the money thank god only for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it,1
8333,our dealings with courtney lankford the gm were nothing short of pleasant to top it all off they didn't even have sheets on it,1
8334,we could hear every conversation from the room next to mine was open all night uncleaned and vacant,1
8335,i decided to stay at this hotel unless you need to stay somewhere cheap,1
8336,the bed was comfortable but there was a huge stain next to the bed,1
8337,while attempting to check out of this hotel,1
8338,i used the bathroom very small as soon as we entered the office we should have turned back,1
8339,wouldn't recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the towels wash cloth were old hard rough looking,1
8340,he also said the room was the very strong oder,1
8341,the stay was awful staff was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was terrible,1
8342,i never felt safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty,1
8343,changed rooms rooms are old and lack creativity,1
8344,when we got to the room the door was open at least it wasent dirty,1
8345,the room was oaky but i will never return to this dirty nasty place no mater how cheap it is,1
8346,very disorganized at the front desk and canceled,1
8347,they said they have breakfast and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
8348,upon arrival i noticed the guy at the desk said he could not guarantee an early check in,1
8349,we contacted the front desk and were told that the room we had,1
8350,i accidently booked 2 rooms in this hotel over the weekend of february 19th 2016,1
8351,put us in a much cheaper smaller room than i had already paid in full when i booked my room,1
8352,when i went to checkout i didn't even want to mention the breakfast,1
8353,during the night as we were going to notice the bleach stains on the couch chair and floor,1
8354,extremely disappointed in wyndham and should get our money back and the manager didn't even care,1
8355,this is the worst hotel that i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
8356,the staff was very nice and quickly move me to another room it was about the same,1
8357,i would never stay here again i'll sleep somewhere else,1
8358,the only good thing about this hotel was the mattress on the pull out bed,1
8359,i was kicked out of the hotel was a terrible place to stay,1
8360,the hotel had no room service menu in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom i had had enough,1
8361,the average person would not be able to sleep for the noise,1
8362,we stayed here years ago and loved how close to the beach but not worth the price,1
8363,during the beginning check in everything looked very quaint and as if it had seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks,1
8364,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't booked on line i would have insisted on my money back,1
8365,and the man who worked at the front desk uniform was not presentable,1
8366,the next morning still no hot water and no heat in room,1
8367,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
8368,we were gon na stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
8369,then when we finally got to our room we opened the door and there was a small wobbly table but no chairs,1
8370,soon a train was barrelling past our room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
8371,i was desperate for a room and it was a great overall trip,1
8372,it was awful and i would never stay here again,1
8373,we requested a non smoking room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
8374,the toilet paper holder was the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
8375,when we first arrived i thought the smell in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night,1
8376,would never recommend this hotel to my worst nightmare,1
8377,i did not even though i had already paid for two,1
8378,but after three hours later after we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
8379,hotel was fine for the price and for a 1 night stay this is not a place anyone should stay,1
8380,this time they couldn't scan my credit card so they said i could not get a third key 3,1
8381,there are no ice machines at this location and if you want a night sleep and not plan on being in room,1
8382,i was afraid to walk on the bathroom floor in our previous room,1
8383,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price per night that we paid,1
8384,we were told we couldn't get to mobile until late,1
8385,when i went into the room the room was extremely hot so we called the front desk the next morning was much more hospitable,1
8386,5 hours from portland oregon to miles city we were very tired so didn't push for a refund etc,1
8387,i was getting ready to take a shower and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
8388,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
8389,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
8390,the service was horrible the room was not clean when i arrived,1
8391,when i woke up i found there were no towels of any kind in the room bed was short-sheeted,1
8392,it is their job to make sure it was the right room woke everyone up and didn't even shut and latch,1
8393,needless to say we will never ever stay at a super 8,1
8394,did not like the hotel room as it wasn't clean at all,1
8395,my tv in the room had an odor,1
8396,we seen there lodging and it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
8397,when we complained and asked for a different room but the hotel was the pits,1
8398,hotel was definitely not worth the high prices that they want,1
8399,a sticker on the bathroom door had a hole in it,1
8400,while i agree that the staff is friendly this hotel is extremely outdated,1
8401,there were holes in the frame where it looks like it hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
8402,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and it was impossible to change to non smoking,1
8403,there's a small light over the first light switch as you walk into the lobby there is an unpleasant smell,1
8404,well if we had a room with a king bed and a sofa-bed in addition to the room fee,1
8405,it's the perfect place if you want to party all night long,1
8406,the rooms are in much need of new furnishings and renovation,1
8407,like many others we decided to take a chance i asked the front desk for anything you will be standing there for over 15 minutes,1
8408,at this point my family and i stayed at the days inn in bowling green on 3 5 2016,1
8409,besides the foul unusual smell in the hotel room and the bathroom are run down and need updating,1
8410,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
8411,we were gon na stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards,1
8412,stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
8413,toilet was coming off the floor hair all over the bathroom there was a puddle from the moment we walked in,1
8414,in the future i much rather sleep in my car before i'd spend the night here again,1
8415,additionally they charge us duoble of its regular price due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming,1
8416,only good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
8417,family of 5 looking for a place to eat at 6:00 in the morning,1
8418,there were ants in my room and it was cheap,1
8419,the conditions off my room was terrible a broken bed the tv didn't work and the tv had a whopping 5 channels,1
8420,the bathtub was dirty the bathroom looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what they were talking about,1
8421,we planned on staying there at a later date and asked if we could move to a non-smoking room,1
8422,i returned the keys to the front desk as i was in a newly renovated room,1
8423,the staff was nice the only good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
8424,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the fourth of july ten months in advance,1
8425,the handle broke into 3 pieces and i had to check out without taking shower,1
8426,very dated musty and beds are hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
8427,he kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not feel welcomed from the moment we walked in,1
8428,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
8429,the hotel room was fine however when we left the first morning we found that the shower curtain was wrinkled and stained,1
8430,when we figured this out i went to the governors hotel website and made reservations for patio dining,1
8431,the staff was awful the owner came to my room banging on the door at 8 am and woke us up,1
8432,the elevators smelled like i don't know what my total was for the night,1
8433,the tub was so bad that i booked 2 nights and room was not ready,1
8434,pool closed hole in the wall and the shower was very dirty,1
8435,stated pool area was new it was in poor condition broken furniture worn out receptacles,1
8436,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was hair on the bedspread the inside of the hotel and outside,1
8437,we needed an inexpensive hotel stay and that's what you are getting and if you don't want your car to get vandalized,1
8438,my skin was crawling just being in it and i ended up having to take one room,1
8439,front desk staff was friendly and helped us find a nice place to have dinner,1
8440,i had to get out of there fast enough,1
8441,the bathroom ceiling above the shower looked like it had not been wiped down properly,1
8442,this was after we had them switch our room as it was probably the worst room i've ever stayed in,1
8443,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
8444,loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot directly in front of the facade of the building,1
8445,this was by far one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in,1
8446,they sent up maintenance to the room and closed it again,1
8447,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is not as pictured online and suggest that they avoid this hotel,1
8448,first of all we checked in and went to my room,1
8449,if i knew i could upload pictures on my review i would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking,1
8450,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
8451,we had to get 2 rooms because we have a family member in icu at fmh across from the hotel,1
8452,they brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow,1
8453,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the shower i noticed several pieces of hair all over the place,1
8454,when water in the bathroom was very dirty,1
8455,any time we would go to the front desk and they never fixed it,1
8456,front desk clerk said she had another room to show us how to operate the tv,1
8457,i called the front desk to ask for another room and the other one was worse as it smelled like mold,1
8458,customer service was very poor the front desk clerk samantha refused to honor it and was rather rude,1
8459,when i tired to check in i was not told i was being giving and ada room,1
8460,so i asked for my money back and they said the a cs were new no apologizes no room switch,1
8461,we arrived late in the evening before thanksgiving,1
8462,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
8463,very tough stay at this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
8464,we needed separate beds and the room we were given a couple cards neither of which opened the door,1
8465,but as i booked end prepaid through hotels dot com and why we would still be charged,1
8466,the room was tiny and the front desk woman was rude,1
8467,the towels were paper thin and there was no one to call when there was a party in the parking lot with their luggage,1
8468,the first room they put me in a king bed in the am i went to get coffee at 9 pm,1
8469,the only association they have with the theme park is that it is not as pictured online and suggest that they avoid this hotel,1
8470,the room smelled the air didn't work and the refrigerator didn't work,1
8471,now i understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
8472,the tub was so bad that there was no ice machine on the premises,1
8473,air quality of this hotel was not a good experience,1
8474,the employees did not go out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
8475,firstly you must know that this is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time,1
8476,the reservation was wrong and i had to check in through a window slot,1
8477,website and book in room states there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines,1
8478,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
8479,the only reason i booked that room was because i was given a much lower price when,1
8480,my room wasnt that clean it smelled like mold and felt extremely damp in the carpet was wet so we change it,1
8481,do yourself a favor find somewhere else to stay and save yourself the irritation and frustration,1
8482,first i was given a room that was the size of a closet,1
8483,arrived late with young child to find out the owner shut the restaurant down,1
8484,first off let me start by saying i paid 50 a night to stay in a room over night,1
8485,my boyfriend and i and when we walked into the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
8486,my room despite being told it was a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on them,1
8487,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
8488,upon check-in i waited while the woman at the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
8489,you could hear all the conversations in the rooms around me were partying all night until dawn,1
8490,the bathroom had a hair in the shower stained sheets mattresses my non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
8491,my husband and i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
8492,i was so sick the next morning i checked out and asked for a refund if it wasn't to late,1
8493,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1
8494,i left because i felt unsafe in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet,1
8495,it was 20 degrees and the door to the shared kitchenette area would not close,1
8496,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
8497,first of all know that there is no comparably priced accommodations in boston,1
8498,my room despite being told it was a non-smoking room at super 8 and all was well,1
8499,the staff at the ip are very friendly and we did not even try to have their coffee,1
8500,the manager was very unprofessional and the general manager would not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1
8501,it took 45 minutes to get a ride,1
8502,when i guy from expedia got back on the phone with who i guessed to be a displeased customer,1
8503,this hotel was dirty unkept and did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
8504,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the lobby back there the key difficult to use,1
8505,then to top it all off they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
8506,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
8507,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't sleep because our neighbors were having a good time till 4 am,1
8508,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible after breakfast,1
8509,i do not recommend this place to anyone,1
8510,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not have a weapon so i was not shot,1
8511,woke up to no hot water for an early morning shower,1
8512,do not stay here letting it rott as they are building a new motel for what more drugs and killings,1
8513,next time i will read the reviews more carefully and spend the extra money on a much nicer place to stay,1
8514,even though the staff is very nice we will never stay at another howard johnson or use expedia again,1
8515,the door across from our room looked like it has not been updated in years,1
8516,this is about the worse place i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
8517,they also did not disclose that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
8518,there were lemon slices under my bed and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
8519,the hotel smells like mold the staff was not helpful the manager wasn't accommodating at all,1
8520,they wanted to call the front desk and canceled,1
8521,worse hotel of my life never again they don't even deserve 1 star for their rating,1
8522,one of the worst if not the worst hotel but not the best,1
8523,when we called front desk to mention this,1
8524,when we finally got our keys the first room had a noxious smell the carpet was wet so we change it,1
8525,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
8526,when i arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
8527,elevator was broken and i saw a cockroach in the bathtub,1
8528,the lifeguard said she didn't understand english this was a fiasco,1
8529,if you have a child don't go down to the basement to use the public restrooms,1
8530,that night there was ice in the refrigerator but i am not a clean freak by any definition,1
8531,the hotel is terrible and i don't recommend anyone to stay there for less than a week,1
8532,we cancelled our reservation immediately after a look at the suite and my traveling companion accepted the reservation,1
8533,this is one of the worst hotel experience i have ever had,1
8534,the exterior of the hotel is not secure,1
8535,then i was given a room that was booked within 3 minutes of the first,1
8536,we called the front desk and they said they would only provide breakfast for 2,1
8537,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and they questioned my reason for doing so,1
8538,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't get comfortable in the beds,1
8539,it was necessary to walk through to get to check in and they gave our room away,1

8541,when we first walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall old floors,1
8542,the desk chair had a giant unidentifiable stain on its seat and i did not sleep well at all the night we stayed,1
8543,going to be in abilene for more than a couple of hours in the room we decided to leave,1
8544,before we put our things in the room i paid for i felt she was very unprofessional,1
8545,i have stayed several times at the exended stay on kennerly but at this point we were very disappointed with our most visit,1
8546,we were put in a room the first night where construction was going on just looked like all the water was drained out of it,1
8547,we checked in got into our room almost an hour after arriving and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room,1
8548,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and i basically had to sleep with pistol,1
8549,i booked on hotels and they said i would have to wait until 11 am to see a live person,1
8550,however there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
8551,needless to say we will never stay here again and it should not even be a one star,1
8552,the hotel had no room service menu in the room and the tv remote needed batteries,1
8553,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the pool all day long,1
8554,areas of no paint on the bathroom walls holes in the wall hair on the pillows and the tv did not work,1
8555,we don't have to look for a room late in the evening and we were exhausted from two days of driving,1
8556,we stayed multiple nights and had to go get another key as the key never worked,1
8557,was told that could be pobbile because room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
8558,they figured cause i was from out of town and it was dirty,1
8559,they sent up maintenance to the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette,1
8560,no towels remote didn't work room smelled funny lights didn't work right it was either hot or cold,1
8561,the place advertised ad having free wifi but we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
8562,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
8563,had an attitude like she didn't want to refund my money but the police made them,1
8564,apparently they had a water leakage on the first floor were complaining but hotel did nothing,1
8565,the tub was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there,1

8569,on a health and cleanliness note we went to use the toilet the seat fell off,1
8570,enough said do not book this hotel friends of ours did,1
8571,i had to climb under the sink to shut off the water supply it simply wouldn't stop the flow,1
8572,my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know about this but no response,1
8573,when i tried to take a shower there was hair hanging from the shower and dried phlegm on the wall by the door casing,1
8574,the room was very hot and even though we had one in the previous room,1
8575,the room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
8576,staff was polite and rooms were clean and comfortable but for the price we paid i was expecting a better experience,1
8577,the staff was warm and inviting even around the midnight hour when i checked in i was given a total but when i got there,1
8578,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were booked solid,1
8579,it would have been nice to know that the hotel was changing hands soon so they didn't seem to care or was concerned,1
8580,i called front desk and they gave me a new set,1
8581,to say the very least i will never use hotel or stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
8582,someone in the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
8583,needless to say i couldn't wait to get out in the morning,1
8584,i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone plus on line we reserved for americas best value inn has poor service,1
8585,we arrived about midnight to find that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
8586,i did not stay as i did not feel it was a safe place for travel with kids,1
8587,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
8588,i and my daughter spent one night at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
8589,we barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't have to sleep in a dingy room anyway,1
8590,it was dirty and had hair on them,1
8591,they figured cause i was from out of town and it was dirty not ready so they moved me in another room,1
8592,also the floors sounded like they were going to get us another room and they gave us an upgrade in another building,1
8593,we only used the room to sleep we didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had,1
8594,incorrectly charged my boyfriend and i walked into the bathroom,1
8595,there are many other properties in the area that had vacancy and i can now see why it was so cheap,1
8596,room had holes in the walls and carpeting,1
8597,i complain to the desk i was told to go to a presentation on wyndham properties,1
8598,the sink faucet leaked so carpet was wet and so was the comforter on the bed,1
8599,the doors had all been kicked in and was held together with nails,1
8600,i can honestly say this is probably the filthiest hotel i have ever stayed in,1
8601,very old hotel musty smell bedding and rooms were not clean floors were filthy cockroaches in the room,1
8602,we called the front desk to unclog the toilet and the room stunk,1
8603,then the room was trashing one of the beds which had really dirty sheets and we were given a tiny room,1
8604,just wanted to let potential travelers know that when we called to see if they had any rooms available for the night,1
8605,i returned the keys to the front desk for issues the girl working the front desk on our first night rude rude and rude,1
8606,while i agree that the staff is friendly but the rooms are not only out dated but dirty,1
8607,we have booked rooms through expedia on several occasions but this was by far one of the worst hotels i have ever visited,1
8608,however there is no excuse for a room that we pre-paid,1
8609,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
8610,the only good thing about our stay at this hotel and they were so disappointed that preferred to pay their room and leave,1
8611,when i walked in the room and we left,1
8612,when i asked what type of incidentals could i incur i was told that they did not have any amenities as promised,1
8613,i had a reservation for this hotel but when i got to the room he opened the door and the jam,1
8614,on 2 8 15 i booked thru expedia and paid in full for a room that we pre-paid,1
8615,there was nonfunctional iron the room smelled like someone had died in there,1
8616,i asked for a room change and got one but that room had the same issue with slow drain in shower,1
8617,so i went back down to ask for a different room but no changes were made,1
8618,this was our first time staying at this hotel and,1
8619,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and bits of hair everywhere in the bathroom on the vanity in our room,1
8620,questionable activity in the parking lot and cops at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
8621,the carpet had rips all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
8622,staff goofed up our billing resulting in an hour and a half for our room at check in,1
8623,the desk clerk was more interested in that than accommodating guests,1
8624,upon arrival the toilet had been used and thought that once we turned on the ceiling fan to help cool us down,1
8625,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
8626,the shower was broken the toilet seat was held on by 1 bolt,1
8627,we didn't feel safe in the hotel room and the bathroom are run down and need updating,1
8628,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
8629,it didn't close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1
8630,room was nasty smelling and fridge had not been cleaned and at 7:30pm had to ask for different one,1
8631,to my utter disgust the room was dirty and the shower walls had visible dirt,1
8632,there was no air conditioning in this hotel,1
8633,well 4:30 am arrives and the front desk called the police for no reason,1
8634,the first room i was given i notice that the door was broke stove was broke everything was broke,1
8635,the air in the overall common core are of the building was deteriorating chipped peeling warped etc,1
8636,we planned a short last minute trip to the miami area but the rooms were not clean floors were filthy cockroaches in the room,1
8637,the next day we checked into the hotel and were immediately turned off,1
8638,i had to cancel my reservation upon booking i was told that there was a 45 minute wait,1
8639,we asked for another room and the hotel there were problems,1
8640,this hotel should not be on expedia list,1
8641,three different types of bugs extremely rude manager and desk clerks black mold on the shower curtain the shower curtain would not stay up,1
8642,let me start off the 1st room they gave us had only one bed,1
8643,the check-in and the fact that it had 2 full bathrooms,1
8644,needless to say i am never going to stay there again on our same business trip,1
8645,didn't even say hello as we walked in the room sneezed like mildew and it was really unnerving and felt very unsafe,1
8646,they said that it was a non-smoking room had cigarette burns on them,1
8647,also i found a large bite on my right arm after the first night because of the location and the other was price,1
8648,the only piece of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was even cracked,1
8649,she has no ability or desire to resolve issues and the rest of the room was horrible the wifi was almost nonexistent,1
8650,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
8651,if i wanted to stay in that kind of environment,1
8652,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
8653,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
8654,ceiling and ceiling fans we're full of cob webs didn't look anything like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
8655,the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the room was the same and as clean in which the lady responded yes,1
8656,and the pool looked decent even though we did not stay there because i was on a get away,1
8657,the next day i contacted hotels and they told me the hotel pays him 75,1
8658,i got this room for one night and deal with it the next day,1
8659,we are hilton honors members and made a reservation on-line to begin saturday night,1
8660,not good experience to stay in this room and sleep with the overwhelming smell of fresh paint,1
8661,we're working on trying to get our money back and the manager didn't even care,1
8662,we had holes in our towels and bed sheets were old and disgusting,1
8663,overall it was a very bad experience there,1
8664,this was by far the worst hotel that we have stayed at the homewood plainfield previously and it was o,1
8665,dirty wet hand towel hanging on shower rod when we arrived,1
8666,the door to the room and they don't care,1
8667,i have athsma and for that reason requested a non smoking room and room used to be a good one before this new owner,1
8668,we walk into our room and found used underwear hanging from the back of the toilet not a little the whole back,1
8669,first floor smelled of smoke even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
8670,we thought that the room was never clean,1
8671,r r the trails arguably the best part of this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly,1
8672,we moved to a red roof inn or quality inn and had a great time there,1
8673,was forced to stay because it was the only place for miles with a vacancy,1
8674,there was no one but her there and that it was too bad i had already been marked for the day before,1
8675,the room was dirty when we checked in they gave us a room at the hotel deca march 3-6,1
8676,such as the bathroom plumbing there was no cold water in shower so i had to pay more,1
8677,basically awful from start to end never again will i book at a no name place,1
8678,offered no apologies or refund options so i went to the front desk and spoke to the manager yesterday,1
8679,and finally we went down to the front desk and asked them to change my sheets,1
8680,this is the worse hotel i have ever stayed in,1
8681,staff stole 4 000 out of our room on ground floor,1
8682,was working out of town had stayed at the tidewater a few years ago and it was satisfactory,1
8683,they also did not disclose that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog,1
8684,and we asked the front desk the desk clerk was rude,1
8685,i went to check out they refused to give me a refund i had to go and ask for towels,1
8686,and this was on a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
8687,our room smelled musty from the moment we opened the door and we were immediately hit with a terrible stench,1
8688,upon arrival the toilet had been used and thought that once we turned on the ceiling fan to help cool us down,1
8689,incorrectly charged my boyfriend and i booked a room through hotwire's hot rate the hotel was not clean,1
8690,he finally gave us a non-smoking room was not non-smoking,1
8691,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
8692,there was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the door where you could see outside through our door and our ac unit,1
8693,that had to be the worst hotel experience of my life,1
8694,the towels have holes in them so you can see what i mean,1
8695,the pool was closed for repairs which was one of the reasons i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
8696,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
8697,woke up with bites all over my upper body and legs,1
8698,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
8699,the staff was very nice lady at check-in to the service at the breakfast the visit was superb,1
8700,the reservation was wrong and i had to check in through a window slot,1
8701,the room had dead bees and flies in front of the lobby area and a homeless looking man in the lobby,1
8702,i was given a room key when i checked the bed in the new room,1
8703,i kept thinking about the dirty carpets and was not able to figure out our reservation in a timely manner,1
8704,we were so disappointed with the cleanliness and odor of a room we had to deal with nonsense from an incompetent employee,1
8705,one of the reasons i book this hotel or use this site anymore,1
8706,l don't porpoise this hotel to anyone nor would i stay there again,1
8707,they were positioned so close the the bed it was hard to know while booking online what type of hotel this would be,1
8708,i called down to the front desk first thing in the morning i was told sorry there is no other rooms available to change,1
8709,duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains burn holes in comforter and the towels had stains on them,1
8710,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
8711,water did not come out of the office as quickly as possible,1
8712,yes i get that there was a big problem in our room and the hotel there were problems,1
8713,when we got there they told us they didnt offer it anymore,1
8714,we checked in got into our room almost an hour after arriving and it was dirty not ready so they moved me to another room,1
8715,the bottom of the door had a hole in it there was no toilet seat on the toilet,1
8716,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
8717,and that was not all the curtains in the room were in poor condition it also had a musty smell,1
8718,the only reason we stayed the night before a real gem,1
8719,the springs were shot in both beds and they were not impressed with the hotel either,1
8720,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
8721,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and the staff of the 4 seasons very professional,1
8722,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
8723,she went back downstairs and front desk gave me a late check out after i agree to pay 75,1
8724,when i try to get my money back,1
8725,for the price paid 100 and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
8726,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
8727,this is the worst hotel that we have stayed at the homewood plainfield previously and it was very nice,1
8728,the lobby was being used for drug deals,1
8729,there were lemon slices under my bed and next to the phone it says it would be 2,1
8730,on 2 8 15 i booked thru expedia and paid in full for a room that had people in it,1
8731,they had no one available to look at it at 10 the next day,1
8732,it would turn the water off in the middle warm area so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
8733,the only perk were that the beds were comfortable and rate was ok,1
8734,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it was unused for a year or more,1
8735,when we asked to talked to a manager she said he was not available until afternoon i repeat never again,1
8736,although the staff is friendly but you can tell right away no one abides by the rules,1
8737,the sheets on the bed looked like someone had been murdered in the bathtub,1
8738,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
8739,they answered our questions curtly and seemed to want us out of the office and no one considered repairing it for 3 days,1
8740,when we arrived to check in i noticed the front door carpet was dirty and stained but the sheets were clean,1
8741,yet it looked more like she was preparing for bed and did not want to guess from could not sit on floor due to nastiness,1
8742,room was beyond shabby beds did not have a weapon so i was not sure what the charge was for,1
8743,the fluorescent bulb above the vanity was missing and the desk lamp did not work lights above mirror were barely noticeable,1
8744,when i called i was told they were don't for the day at about 10 am,1
8745,they had to give me a refund i had to go to office to have hotel card turned back on to be used,1
8746,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
8747,on my return trip i am staying in the same area unfortunately i made the wrong choice,1
8748,the fluorescent bulb above the vanity was missing and the desk lamp did not work lights above mirror were barely noticeable,1
8749,it was an okay room for the money but i would not cook anything on it or in it,1
8750,hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1
8751,we only used the room to sleep we didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had,1
8752,so we had to wait 2 hours to get the room down in about 5 hours,1
8753,i went and checkin and gave the key to my room and i went up to find that the cleaning,1
8754,i contacted hotels and they told me there was nothing they could do because they don't know if i hit the proprietor on a,1
8755,if i wanted to inspect my room because she would not be able to sleep in a ditch but that's not saying too much,1
8756,we arrived and were told our room was not clean had bad odor and carpet was severely stained,1
8757,after staying last year we were offered a different room but no changes were made,1
8758,wish you had complimentary breakfast so we don't have the phone number for the manager to call me,1
8759,the people at the front desk to ask for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
8760,although we didn't mind that we had a picture of the bug,1
8761,the shuttle bus drivers never said a word to us and were not very helpful and said i see that you canceled but i,1
8762,my new room was also dirty and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine,1
8763,this was the most horrible experience i have never experienced anything like this before,1
8764,we were there for the whole weekend and i asked for extra towels they would only give us 2 more,1
8765,we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water,1
8766,discovered the first night and the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it,1
8767,i called back and the assistant manager picked up and said oh yes mr,1
8768,we arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon and there was not enough hot water to fill the tub,1
8769,the shower in the next room all night,1
8770,so i phoned the office to say this was the worse hotel i have ever been in,1
8771,we booked two rooms only rooms we could find for the two hours before and all were booked,1
8772,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
8773,although i had a non-smoking room but the entire first floor was closed,1
8774,we tried to open the windows but they were broken and the screens were bent this was on the ground floor with an ally outside,1
8775,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
8776,if you ever go to the front desk for some towels and they was clearly 4 of us,1
8777,the service provided by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
8778,i left a day early when they put me on the first floor and the lobby smelled really musty,1
8779,i was scared couldn't tell who they were considering the hotel was in need of serious remodeling and maintenance,1
8780,i've been in many hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
8781,the bathroom sink was stopped up through our entire stay in virginia beach so needless to say we were disgusted,1
8782,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
8783,the countless loads of laundry to make sure they would not give us a refund,1
8784,he told us to go to the lobby without her,1
8785,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
8786,be aware of this hotel the man works at the reception desk was rude and said there wasn't anything to be done,1
8787,we move forward and got our room keys as we walk up to the room while the bellhop was busy watching traffic outside,1
8788,the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting an old run down motel room,1
8789,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
8790,this is one of the best hotel i stayed at and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
8791,great location it may not look like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
8792,the rooms smelled weird and the staff was rude and lazy,1
8793,once in the room the water wouldn't work in the next room all night,1
8794,i asked for a manager to contact me but since they did not i am reviewing it here,1
8795,the ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't get to mobile until late,1
8796,i was made to feel like a nuisance the whole time i was there because i was worried about my safety,1
8797,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever been in,1
8798,we tried to leave and we were told to take fire alarm apart and try it again,1
8799,i asked if it was ocean and was told it was not available in the pool area,1
8800,found a stranger's long black hair in shower from previous guests,1
8801,my girlfriend and i had a late flight and got to the hotel it was a different number then online,1
8802,needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
8803,this was the worst hotel i ever been,1
8804,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to go buy lysol and spray everything,1
8805,not just one or two but multiple hairs all over the place don't stay here,1
8806,when we arrived to the room the room smelled like smoke,1
8807,we walked into the room i just cried,1
8808,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most dishusting hotel ive ever been to,1
8809,the power was out the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting an old run down motel room,1
8810,the rooms were dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed if almost all the parking lot was lousy,1
8811,there was no phone in the room didn't work so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
8812,this was my first time staying at this hotel every again,1
8813,shower door was broken and the floors were so dirty and gross i never took my shoes off,1
8814,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
8815,we do not recommend this motel nor would i stay here again,1
8816,the check in was quick and i had asked for a ground floor because my son is handicapped,1
8817,the room had mold on the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down,1
8818,seriously disappointed we go back to the front desk to change our room,1
8819,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
8820,then we asked for a nonsmoking room but you can tell they inexperienced mostly in there 20s,1
8821,i booked this room for one night using hotels,1
8822,not impressed and would never recommend this hotel to anyone,1
8823,in the end i had to book some of the rooms were used for low income long-term housing,1
8824,when i got back to the room and closed it again,1
8825,the hotel smells bad and the staff was friendly and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
8826,when i complained the manager said there was nothing wrong with the card,1
8827,let me just say i will never book with chain again,1
8828,the front desk girl was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
8829,terrible customer service they failed to clean the room is make the bed,1
8830,we moved to a different room fortunately the heat worked in this room and sleep with the overwhelming smell of fresh paint,1
8831,non-smoking room but the entire first floor was under construction,1
8832,unfortainatley there were people in out of the room immediatly and there were no other options for a no smoking room,1
8833,no one would talk to us and we had booked for 2 day's,1
8834,we didn't even stay 2 hours i had to get them to close the pool finally at 11 pm,1
8835,on a more positive note the woman at the front desk the girl was nice but told us,1
8836,josh at the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they would comp the price of the room for 5 minutes,1
8837,they wanted to call the front desk and they never fixed it,1
8838,way over priced for such a bad hotel i left and found a different hotel,1
8839,and i had to search for another one in the middle of the highway-it would be more comfortable,1
8840,this hotel was dirty unkept and did not have any regular coffee for the type of coffee pot in the room,1
8841,there was only one towel in the room and not the same color of original paint,1
8842,from the moment i walked in i knew it was not non-smoking,1
8843,it started with the games regarding the fact that they have smoking rooms right next to nonsmoking rooms,1
8844,if we weren't so tired and the room was decent,1
8845,this one had a heavy scent of bleach in the morning and went to the football game,1
8846,there was yelling and screaming coming from another room but it was late and we were tired but we will not stay there again,1
8847,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were getting the rooms cleaned,1
8848,this is how bad it is we had to jump through hoops to get cable on,1
8849,i drove them to this place and it shouldn't even be an option for other guests,1
8850,we went to the front desk to give me the type of room i booked,1
8851,i almost took pictures it was so bad the sec i walked into the lobby to a curtain of,1
8852,i left crying and i will never recommend this dirty and uncomfortable hotel,1
8853,many other issues but i will never go back to this hotel,1
8854,we asked the front desk if i could cancel and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
8855,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the trashiest and loudest one that i have ever stayed at,1
8856,i pulled in at 1 am with two small children i simply had no choice,1
8857,the pictures can not be farther away from the reality the rooms are small and outdated with furniture broken or dated,1
8858,this is absolutely the worst hotel i have stayed in hotels in odessa texas and rock springs wyoming,1
8859,my wife and i checked in late at night and leave in the morning because this place is a scam,1
8860,the staff was friendly extremely helpful and went out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
8861,this was not the best experience the front desk staff particularly jeanette and sunny are rude and discourteous,1
8862,the minute i got to the room it's very outdated,1
8863,it's supposed to be a non smoking room the comforters had cigarette hole all over,1
8864,never stat at this hotel the same nights,1
8865,public areas are nice and the front desk person didn't care,1
8866,they tell you one thing on the phone and didn't have any,1
8867,i wanted to go get a air freshener,1
8868,it was actually cooler outside in the middle of the night so we finally realized that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
8869,so needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
8870,they put ear plugs in the room and the window sill was full of black muck,1
8871,the ac unit was coming out of the faucet as it puddled in the tub it didn't drain and was just scuzzy,1
8872,the pillows were hard and the size of a lap top in a corner,1
8873,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the staff person who accomplish them,1
8874,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to alabama,1
8875,the rooms are set up nicely but it looked as if the room had not been cleaned or maintained in years,1
8876,i wasn't given a non smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
8877,holes in the wall hair on the pillows and the tv did not work and it was 90 degrees outside,1
8878,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
8879,the hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly so i went back to the front desk and canceled,1
8880,i didn't even stay we had to go get them dresser had diapers in drawer,1
8881,i booked the room using expedia so the room was very hot ac dosent work good at all,1
8882,when i went into the room and it had been assigned to the couple,1
8883,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
8884,i do not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on my experience the prior year,1
8885,and the only reason i choose that room was because i was given a handicap room that i didn't request,1
8886,when i called front desk and they said they had security to watch ha,1
8887,within five minutes of checking in to the room i knew it was a mistake,1
8888,the toilet paper holder was the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1
8889,i would not stay at this hotel frequently,1
8890,because we got in so late there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy,1
8891,the hotel facility is old and there is a bad smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
8892,we did not feel safe and the condition of the carpet and tubs were in bad shape,1
8893,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
8894,this cost me more money to stay some where else in fact anywhere else,1
8895,never stat at this hotel the place is run down old furniture not a very clean place,1
8896,the service was awful i know everyone has a bad day from time to time but if you lie that is,1
8897,there were bugs in the room on our first night,1
8898,1 when we called to see if they had any available single bedrooms,1
8899,we were schedued to stay for a long time whenever i was in the shower the condensation from the ceiling was dripping brown,1
8900,we checked in around 6:00pm and the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out,1
8901,the funky sour old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1

8905,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
8906,the pool area was supposed to close at 9:00 pm but we had to call down to the front desk to change our room,1
8907,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
8908,it was the worst hotel i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
8909,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to a different hotel,1

8911,the hallway on the third floor and the elevator sounded like it was on its last legs,1
8912,the topper the bed linens had not been changed from a prior guest,1
8913,i asked for a one bedroom with two queen beds as i had requested,1
8914,first i was given a non smoking room and so did the chair in room,1
8915,if they are not that confident in their room you should not be able to reach high enough to turn it off,1
8916,we were told we would not get a refund because it's a third party billing and i'm not talking about any luxury,1
8917,the bathtub had burn marks on the sink and dressers,1
8918,the computer in the business center was so old it was hardened in the little containers,1
8919,during the night as we were going to eat al together,1
8920,first we got a room with no hot water it took over an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
8921,first of all i usually like red roof because they have a great king street location but that is all,1
8922,and who knows may be just because we were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down,1
8923,we had to jump up and scream to get service and they were being rude about it,1
8924,first i was uncomfortable with lady at front desk did not do anything about it,1
8925,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
8926,he proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and leave the hotel at night 12:00 am,1
8927,they had a wedding that we didn't even have an ice machine,1
8928,there were chicken bones on the air conditioner and beds were very stained,1
8929,also learned that this seems to be a guest house but not a hotel,1
8930,i called the front desk to request one,1
8931,on the first day refrigerator was not working and looked like someone was partying in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket,1
8932,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
8933,the jacuzzi was filthy i took pictures it was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there,1
8934,the hotel overall is the only one that did not lock,1
8935,we left early in the morning and he never did,1
8936,the towels were paper thin and there was no one at the front desk,1
8937,also there is no elevator to the second floor had loose wobbly steps,1
8938,only good thing i can say was that staff was friendly and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
8939,breakfast person was apologetic but after waiting in line for the other 20 minute,1
8940,apparently they had a water leakage on the first floor are noisey due to railroad passing and traffic noise,1
8941,but then my in-laws got the room next to me was showering in my room,1
8942,the jacuzzi was filthy i took pictures it was so bad i didn't even try to get my money back,1
8943,they were unprofessional and walked into our room and everything is dirty,1
8944,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
8945,the guest service was very rude at check-in to the service at the desk sucked the guy was ignorant and disrespectful,1
8946,room was extremely poorly cleaned there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
8947,the room was dirty and not well maintained,1
8948,the room was clean even though we had prepaid the hotel on hotel,1
8949,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled just like the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
8950,i called them and hotels and they said i would have to say this was unacceptable,1
8951,the carpet looked clean but it was very clean and beds were comfortable,1
8952,for that reason i will not recommend this hotel if you plan on checking in early,1
8953,manager of hotel notified and i was told he couldn't do anything until they talked to their manager,1
8954,we were able to catch them just in time so that we could pass on the narrow balcony to get to our room,1
8955,the 1st room we were given a 6th floor room anyway,1
8956,i do have to say that the sheets on the bed and the bed had crumbs and staples all over,1
8957,we stay in this area often and we will never go back to that hotel and am reporting this to choice hotels directly,1
8958,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to reach florida,1
8959,front desk employees were very nice and i wish the room had been smoked in,1
8960,we had to get a bag of ice at the front desk that checked us in was very sweet and friendly,1
8961,all the reason we will not stay at another red roof inn,1
8962,i feel like i was in clean hotel when it came to the room to show us bet was too busy checking in other guests,1
8963,it's sad because the front desk staff who were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
8964,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
8965,the place was really shabby our bathroom was not clean hair in the shower and on towels,1
8966,it was actually cooler outside in the middle of the night thinking the ceiling was going to cave in,1
8967,i can live with outdated interior but i am not sure they know what a vacuum is,1
8968,they said they were completely booked i couldn't get towels for my room,1
8969,the fold out couch bed didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
8970,we asked for our money back and they said i got what the room i ordered,1
8971,they are in the middle of the floor,1
8972,the person at the front desk were nothing short of pleasant to top it all off they didn't even have an ice machine,1
8973,this was the most horrible experience i have never experienced anything like this before,1
8974,i booked this hotel via hotwire so i had no idea what it was like,1
8975,furniture in the room was incomplete and the alarm clock did not work properly management told me they just replaced 2 weeks earlier,1
8976,when i arrived i was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
8977,this is our first time staying in eugene,1
8978,i complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it was unused for a year or more,1
8979,manager of hotel notified and i was told it was available and that i did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
8980,feeling like i was ripped off for 100,1
8981,good location but not a good hotel and not worth the price charged and i would not stay there again,1
8982,room was small dirty and it smelled like gas from the stove,1
8983,my advice only book this hotel if you have another choice,1
8984,the only piece of furniture in the living room the hair dryer was even cracked,1
8985,i will like to know how this place stays in business,1
8986,got to room after check in and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue,1
8987,my room was non smoking i couldn't get my money back,1
8988,firstly you must know that this is a hostel not a hotel but still,1
8989,i asked the desk cleark to move me and i told her i would have to say this was unacceptable,1
8990,yet it looked more like she was preparing for bed and did not want to work and the bed was very squeaky,1
8991,there also is a pool out front but it was closed as it was still out but was rudely told that it's too late,1
8992,when i went to check out the room and the musty smell was overbearing,1
8993,needless to say we will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
8994,front desk staff was not extremely friendly and she was working when we checked in and the sheets and the ottoman is seaman stained,1
8995,they figured cause i was from out of town it was long distance,1
8996,our stay at the motel 6 next door proved this was not the room i was given had a broken window that was taped,1
8997,so many things were wrong here i don't even want to lay in the bed this hotel is gross,1
8998,i think a lot of the bad smells are caused by the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid,1
8999,the worst room i've ever stayed in,1
9000,the only thing i use this hotel is the nastiest grossest place,1
9001,we tried to close the curtains but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
9002,unfortunately this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
9003,we arrived about midnight to find that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
9004,the elevators smelled like i don't know because our room was not clean,1
9005,it was in the room it's filthy and needs a lot of work,1
9006,there were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the hotel there was a nasty smell,1

9011,there was a used washcloth hanging from the shower faucet and then from the towels,1
9012,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel like this glad that we found a much better hotel,1
9013,although the staff is friendly but you can tell they never clean it,1
9014,i arrived at night and the door to the steps and side door bangs loudly,1

9016,it took me 3 hours to get someone to tell me that i smoked in the room was wet from a recent leak,1
9017,i ask for a taxi to the airport they told me i had to get out of there fast enough,1
9018,i informed him about what happened and he said he would find one and get back to me,1
9019,we needed separate beds and the room we were assigned should not have been rented out,1
9020,i have to say this was the worse stay and serv,1
9021,they still had my reservation under the first room the bed sheets were dirty but the second room was not much better,1
9022,i also didn't care for the fact that breakfast was continental not full and the rooms were not clean at all,1
9023,when they found them the room was in much need of updating,1
9024,mind you we have a siberian husky so the ac problem was not what we expected from a la quinta property,1
9025,my wife and i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and usually they are older but not to bad,1
9026,we we're told we would get shuttled to the port of long beach i highly recommend that you stay somewhere else,1
9027,i had bite marks all on the side of the highway before we stay here again,1
9028,the sink area had not been cleaned and had not been opened yet this year,1
9029,me and my husband woke up in the middle of nowhere,1
9030,the hotel was very clean and quite nice,1
9031,new owners have not upgraded since purchase and don't know to not stay there as well,1
9032,for slightly more money we have stayed in many laquintas and have always been satisfied but this one was a disappointment,1
9033,best i could do was put a chair in front of it to block it just in case,1
9034,there was an instant odor as soon as you walk in the room and we were,1
9035,i immediately went to check out they refused to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that,1
9036,there were several mosquitoes in our room and bathroom and comfortable bed and don't require much more than that,1
9037,one of our pillows and the sham were dirty and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced,1
9038,the receptionist who check us in was very nice and the staff of the 4 seasons very professional,1
9039,but we will never go back to this hotel even for 8 hours sleep before picking up our son from college,1
9040,it was excruciatingly horrible and a waste of money and good nights sleep,1
9041,my kids refused to stay at the suburban extended stay,1

9052,unfortunately that room didn't have an iron,1
9053,all i was able to use it,1

9060,she went back downstairs and got a key to a room with extremely thin walls,1
9061,we tried to leave and we were told we were lucky to have a room,1
9062,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
9063,the staff was very nice and reminded me we had a smoking room and since they were completely booked i couldn't get another room,1
9064,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the only hotel to stay in around this area stay home,1

9072,while waiting a man came in to leave furious because there was blood on the wall soiled sheets and soiled chairs,1
9073,on a more positive note the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
9074,took coffee cups to my room and didn't care what they had to say was all the beds were the same,1
9075,we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels,1
9076,we had no wash clothes in our room and bathroom and a lot of them right outside our room all through the night,1
9077,the ac unit was coming out of the room and they don't care about your complaints and the customers,1
9078,my advice only book this hotel if you are looking for comfort do not choose this location,1
9079,the room was filthy the toilet bowl was so filthy that the soles of your feet became black walking across it,1
9080,they did reimburse the cost of the room on her credit card because there was no fan that i had to so i can review,1
9081,my wife has a bad knee and we had to wait an hour for our room,1
9082,january 2016 i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
9083,to the point where i can't believe these can get away with this,1

9091,the room we were shocked at the condition of the hotel,1
9092,there was also a dirty diaper in the bottom of the door had a wide gap wide enough to let a cold breeze in,1
9093,sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
9094,i can't believe we don't have the word i don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens but come on,1
9095,on the second day after our room was cleaned she did not leave a packet of coffee,1
9096,no it's because this place is a run down dump and they charge way to much 53,1
9097,the tub was so bad that we decided to not stay very bad vibe when we got there wife and kids ages 3,1
9098,the place looked nice enough the price was right and the room wasn't very good because of location of drapes,1

9108,when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1

9158,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know what they were made of,1
9159,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
9160,view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there was no manager available so,1

9172,it was dirty and had hair on them,1
9173,when we first arrived i thought the smell in the room wasn't cleaned because she thought we already checked out,1

9187,i also noticed that there was a 45 minute wait,1
9188,all of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property,1
9189,overpriced by far for what it is a dirty motel complex,1

9194,it's my policy to never stay at a days inn because of my experience with this hotel was incredibly brief,1
9195,i will never stay at another guest house and not recommend it to others due to false advertising of rooms and space,1
9196,it was not even worth the price we paid the hotel itself was very nice but the unpleasantness set in quickly,1
9197,that's about all i can say that's positive,1
9198,the desk top was peeling off from what looked like water,1
9199,we did not stay at this hotel the same nights,1
9200,we both woke up in the middle of it,1
9201,he's asking me how many people i told her 3,1
9202,this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
9203,i can't believe we don't have the phone number for the manager to call me,1
9204,we had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in the had moved us to another extended stay further away,1
9205,we arrived on time in the front and they said they had no vacancy for my time frame,1
9206,breakfast person was apologetic but after waiting in line for the other 20 minute,1
9207,the room was oaky but i will never book thru expedia ever again,1
9208,this hotel should not be on this website,1
9209,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
9210,i would not recommend this motel to anyone,1
9211,so dirty and bad hotel this hotel should not be listed available on expedia,1
9212,so when i finally did decide to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross,1
9213,we were forced to move to a different hotel that is how dirty this hotel was,1
9214,there are dozens and dozens of similar places in this area i will never stay there again,1
9215,the first thing i noticed when i stepped into the room was the same and as clean in which the lady responded yes,1
9216,when we returned to our room after the first night so we could stay and have shuttle for cruise port in morning,1
9217,was also charged for room service i didn't even bother cleaning the room for us,1
9218,one tv did not work and they wanted to switch rooms although they did not have a top sheet only a pilly dirty old blanket,1
9219,the desk clerk was very short and nasty with us,1
9220,the hall way was unfinished we were on the top floor and the furthest from the elevator,1
9221,i would rather sleep in my car at this point just so i wouldn't have stayed there even if they excepted my service animal,1
9222,best place to stay at the end of the hall by the exit door,1
9223,no heat on friday and no do not disturb sign on the door when we entered,1
9224,i asked the lady at the front desk,1
9225,very helpful the staff was very courteous and helpful,1
9226,went to a show at the neptune came back and my buddy's bag was rummaged through,1
9227,the internet in the lobby area was great though but that's not enough of a reason for me to come back,1
9228,he finally gave us a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
9229,best i could do was put a chair in front of it to block it just in case,1
9230,i recommend the suite with the whirlpool bath in the room and now available at front desk because they were booked,1
9231,it was dirty with spots and stains on the carpet chair and the floor of the bathroom,1
9232,i will never ever stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool,1
9233,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel the next night,1
9234,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was the same in both bathrooms,1
9235,no body ever came to clean the room is make the bed,1
9236,the saving grace of this place was the front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional,1
9237,there were pubic hairs in the tub it was dirt brown,1
9238,worse stay i've ever had to stay in a 2 bed room either double beds or queens,1
9239,this resort claimed to be a ski-in ski-out which was important to me,1
9240,from the moment i arrived to the moment i checked in i was not greeted as a ihg rewards member at all,1
9241,then when we finally got the correct room that i'm sure was there for some time,1
9242,we called expedia to have them handle the situation and they would not get me a replacement one,1
9243,the shower in the next room all night,1
9244,i was desperate for a room i already paid for,1
9245,they said that don't have hot water and the front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional,1
9246,she has no ability or desire to resolve issues and the rest of the place had a smoker's smell,1
9247,do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
9248,of driving all i was looking for was a place to sleep but it was so much trouble it was an inconvenience,1
9249,of course that didn't change the fact that the only way to enter was through the front door the next day,1
9250,the door across from our room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years,1
9251,the next day we found out that the swimming pool was broke and hot tub were broke,1
9252,the next morning when we woke up my husband went to ask for more and they only had one person to check every one,1
9253,there was no towels in the room and smelled gas,1
9254,when we went in the room after a long trip the room smelled terrible there were boxes stacked in the hallway etc,1
9255,the breakfast was terrible and on top of that had to deal with bugs crawling across the ceiling,1
9256,i booked a room through expedia for 2 nights at this hotel because it had an outdoor pool,1
9257,this hotel was so bad that i booked 2 nights at this hotel but it's outdated dirty and just overall not recommended,1
9258,there were cigarette burns on the bed and no towels or toilet paper,1
9259,this was our first time staying at this hotel,1
9260,dont do it this place is gross and the front desk person tells me he doesn't have any confirmation on my name,1
9261,just not worth the money for a room like this,1
9262,so i cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation here using up some reward points,1
9263,watered down waffle mix apple juice and orange was no good,1
9264,i had bite marks all on the side of the mattress no change and very uncomfortable,1
9265,we had reseervations 10 days prior to our check in time because they said they were completely booked i couldn't get my money back,1
9266,carpet in the room needs a lot of work,1
9267,this hotel the person smok in the rooms and the coffee shop doesn't open until after 7:00am,1
9268,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
9269,based on this needless to say i will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever,1
9270,got a smoking room when we were supposed to have a queen sofa bed which we needed for our short stay in north platte,1
9271,as we walked up the stairs to our room we were greeted by the smell of the lobby,1
9272,one of the first things i did when we went in the bathroom and ants in the kitchen,1
9273,i knew this was going to happen now,1
9274,on the way to room it literally looked like we were in a non smoking room and so did the chair in room,1
9275,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to wait to get someone's attention,1
9276,the room also smelled heavily of cigarette smoke and the bedding was stained,1
9277,i feel like i was in clean hotel when it came to the room to take care of,1
9278,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time in over forty years that we have not left a tip,1
9279,other places i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
9280,one of the downstairs doors to get in the room i didn't,1
9281,reported it to the front desk the desk clerk was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
9282,we selected this hotel because we were traveling with an 8 month old,1
9283,did not know i was suppose to stay for 1 week,1
9284,even before going to bed i canceled the rest of the staff does not respect her,1
9285,room was not clean fan was broken and i had to share a bed which i was poorly compensated for,1
9286,the most uncomfortable room and bed i have yet to get an email back,1
9287,i wouldn't even have dared try to take a shower i turned on the microwave the heater ain't work,1
9288,the clerk was not pleasant and put me a room that smelled terrible and had to move,1
9289,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
9290,they turned the water off for over 12 hours our key didn't work most of the time,1
9291,as we drove around the hotel to where our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room,1
9292,place needs a lot of repairs also i will never stay at or recommend extended stay,1
9293,on 2 8 15 i booked thru expedia and paid in full for a room that was the size of a small couch pillow,1
9294,upon check in the clerk asked if i wanted to stay in a hotel,1
9295,i would have asked for a different room at early check in and was told it was not available in the room i didn't,1
9296,this is one of the worst rooms ever,1
9297,first night our employee went to working and we had to wait to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
9298,he complained to the desk but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
9299,when i checked in i was told there would be 2 queens sized beds but they were clearly full size instead,1
9300,very noisy inside outside and the staff is very nice we will never stay at this hotel again,1
9301,there were bugs around the sink and the tub would fill up as you took a shower,1
9302,hotel states it's non-smoking but was clearly smoked in prior,1
9303,incorrectly charged my boyfriend and i booked a jr,1
9304,the bathroom floor counters looked like they had not been washed,1
9305,needless to say i will not be staying at this hotel and they didn't fully clean our room,1
9306,if nuway wrestling competition is held here again i'll pay the higher price at a better place,1
9307,we came upstairs to look at the room it smelled very stale and old,1
9308,the temperature fluctuated while taking a shower television never worked correctly microwave did not work and the staff could not move us,1
9309,i was also pretty angry and expressed this to the hotel manager he made acusations that the beer cans were mine,1
9310,this was probably one of the worst hotels i stayed in yet one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences i've ever had,1
9311,find a better hotel for the money you pay the breakfast is veryour poor,1
9312,he finally gave us a non-smoking room it reeked of smoke,1
9313,i have stayed several times at the exended stay on kennerly but at this point we were very disappointed with our most visit,1
9314,we checked in to find out the hotel was under construction,1
9315,as soon as we checked in we were rented a dirty occupied room,1
9316,i called tuesday morning to speak with the owner who was nit there,1
9317,when i arrived at the hotel around 10 pm after a long drive we went to check into our room,1
9318,the receptionist said they didn't have another room to move us to,1
9319,i didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes or take a bath i didn't even want to sit on it,1
9320,we were schedued to stay for a long time whenever i was in the pet room and said she probably wouldn't stay there again,1
9321,also we had toilet issues in our roomm which we had to use to get to our room there was a terrible smell,1
9322,i immediately called the desk and asked for a refund or discount and the woman at the desk finished her personal call,1
9323,its very unfortunate that a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
9324,i would not stay at this hotel for business of pleasure,1
9325,while the hotel was clean the bed was hard as a rock and there is mildew in the shower,1
9326,the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
9327,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
9328,she doesn't give you a lot of money if you come early,1
9329,dont book this hotel until the construction is completed at the end of my long day of hiking through yellowstone,1
9330,the lady at the front desk checking out,1
9331,we went and asked to be switched to another room whose tv remote didn't work either,1
9332,arrived and the front office lady was very nice and very helpful and helped us find excellent restaurants and places of interest,1
9333,hotel sits in the middle of the night,1
9334,i spoke with the manager in the morning and went to the pool,1
9335,the cleanliness of the room was terrible and it was in the lobby also the same smell throughout the complex horrible,1
9336,i did not stay at the hotel to where our room was the balcony was not safe,1
9337,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel was the mattress on the bed,1
9338,i will have a hard time with steps,1
9339,the room was clean even though we had a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
9340,other places i have stayed at this inn twice and i have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one,1
9341,i'll do my best to warn my friends to steer clear of this hotel at all costs,1
9342,the staff refused to give me a receipt when i checked out and asked for a refund they said we couldn't,1
9343,i stayed in thousand of hotels and this is the first time i have ever chose this brand and it will be the last,1
9344,i worked graveyard in the hospitality industry and this was by far the worst i stayed ever,1
9345,at that point we checked out because we did not have printouts from expedia to prove we had a reservation,1
9346,we felt safer and cleaner out camping and will definitely not stay at this hotel for business because my company picked it,1
9347,after a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old child to sleep when black bugs started to jump on us,1
9348,i arrived at 4:00 pm my reserved room was not ready at the 3 pm check in,1
9349,on site manager didn't want to catch any diseases,1
9350,we arrived on time in the front and they said they had none to move us too,1
9351,first they had trouble finding my reservation in the system they just gave us new keys to the room,1
9352,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
9353,this was the nastiest place i have ever been dirty pillowd dirty blankets,1
9354,one of the keys did not work and no towels in first room,1
9355,why she thought that when all our stuff was in tact in the new room,1
9356,the bed linens were tissue paper thin and the bed was comfortable enough,1
9357,staff was apologetic and kind but i will never stay again nor recommend anyone else stay there either,1
9358,hotel would not even return money for first night even though i was told by a worker that the reason wifi doesn't work,1
9359,no one would talk to us and we had booked for 2 day's,1
9360,the manager was very unprofessional and did not want to guess from could not sit on floor due to nastiness,1
9361,when we entered the room and the hallway stank badly,1
9362,so needless to say we will never book with chain again,1
9363,my better half and myself were in town for the egg bowl and stayed at this hotel,1
9364,the room looked like it had mold growing,1
9365,thank goodness there was a denny's across the street and they at least had security there,1
9366,the room was clean however paint was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall,1
9367,overall we were pretty disgusted by the state of the room did not reflect the pictures you saw of rooms on the website,1
9368,there was mold all over the bathroom bugs everywhere the pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep,1
9369,wouldn't stay there again even if they give me a free night but she did not,1
9370,they charge me extra for her in the same room as the buffet and poorly stocked,1
9371,if this is the only good thing about this place,1
9372,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in i was told there was wet bar,1
9373,i do not recommend this place to anyone,1
9374,the resort itself was very nice but we will never go back and i would spend the extra 10 for a motel 6,1
9375,this was the worst hotel i've stayed in some dodgy places i have no problem with it,1
9376,then property use to be own by country inn and suites in elkhart for 2 nights,1
9377,we went down early and found this room for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it again,1
9378,terrible the hall ways in tower three were filthy as well as the bedding a good place to stop for the night,1
9379,when i approached the desk clerk about possibly changing rooms because of the memphis in may until 12 noon,1
9380,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
9381,the room was crawling with roaches the furniture was stained and the paint on the walls didn't match,1
9382,there was an instant odor as soon as you stepped off the elevator you gagged,1
9383,oh and the free wifi only works in the lobby and we tried to put it all behind us,1
9384,the person in the breakfast room was so gross and dirty,1
9385,our room smelled like urine but the smell was not coming from shower i called front desk and they gave me a new set,1
9386,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
9387,bath tub was all yellow cable on television was broken and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
9388,it could be a smoke smell but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it,1
9389,the bathtub was slow to drain so we had to call to find the place,1
9390,the room was clean even though we had a non smoking room and the one i got was broken,1
9391,they said they have no other room and when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the lobby,1
9392,i felt scared to stay there and so only stayed one night on our way to alabama,1
9393,i use a wheelchair and there was no attempt to fix it,1
9394,the air conditioner was small and in a hole in the wall and the shower was dirty enough to cause me to skip it,1
9395,i will have a hard time with the check in,1
9396,i had a business meeting in mo for one day i booked this hotel because the other hotel was so nice,1
9397,when i arrived everything looked good upon further inspection i learned that there was no coffee and water beside the bed facilities weren't clean,1
9398,the smell of smoke was so strong we knew we would not be checking into the hotel,1
9399,it was late i need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,1
9400,hotel was definitely not worth the high price they charge,1
9401,this was supposed to be a non smoking room and i was knocked over by the musty oder in the room,1
9402,the topper the bed linens had not been changed from a prior guest,1
9403,the sheets were wrinkled and gray and i saw a drug deal go down outside my room,1
9404,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
9405,casino was fine but i will never go back and stay there,1
9406,we got there didn't look like a cyclist no,1
9407,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't fully clean our room,1
9408,the sheets on the bed and left for the afternoon,1
9409,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel for business because my company picked it,1
9410,upon checking in the front desk did offer to change rooms but still had crickets crawling all around,1
9411,first we were leary about booking this hotel based on my experience i can't even explain how horrible this hotel was,1
9412,they told me the hotel was not even fully booked,1
9413,its cheaper and the rooms are outdated dark and dank,1
9414,the only positive aspect to this hotel was the treatment from the staff,1
9415,the tub was so bad that we couldn't even get my wheelchair into the bathroom,1
9416,swimming pool was very cold so i went back again and had then reprogrammed,1
9417,i am highly disappointed by the staff and management seemed nice but it couldn't make up for their complete disregard for cleanliness,1
9418,i check in at 4:00 early enough only to be told that this fee was something i would need to contact them,1
9419,tv kept turning off called the front desk and were told that the manager would call us in the morning and he never did,1
9420,i will never stay here again and it should not even be associated with this establishment,1
9421,springs coming out of the faucet as it puddled in the tub it didn't drain and was just scuzzy,1
9422,we had to call the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to care about my situation will never stay there again,1
9423,the next morning i mentioned the room was not cleaned from my previous night,1
9424,he motel room was not ready when we arrived and the a c was not on in the room,1
9425,the bathroom was fairly clean this is the only one that did not make the grade,1
9426,this hotel should be shut down and burnt to the ground,1
9427,we turn the ac unit on and it took forever for her out-dated rooms to cool off,1
9428,i'm glad our room was at the another end of the building,1
9429,it was the filty roach infested the sheets had not been changed nor were the beds made,1
9430,first trip to telluride and this is a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
9431,i was told our room would be available on friday,1
9432,the hotel was only 43 a night and it was actually cooler outside then in the room,1
9433,my room had no light and the smell of mold and water damage will make you gag,1
9434,the place was filthy the mirror wasn't clean the staff wasn't very accommodating,1
9435,when i went to take a shower i turned on the microwave the heater ain't work,1
9436,it's is dirty it smells like cigarette when it was a non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke,1
9437,cheap hotel for a one night stay on september 12,1
9438,this was one of the worst places i've ever stayed at,1
9439,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the couch looks like something they,1
9440,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to put on the pillowcases the pillows were stained,1
9441,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,1
9442,also they could add additional fee that i did not wear on yhe pillows and tape on the walls,1
9443,the bathroom was almost as big as the room and there was no button at the front door and a rat at the back,1
9444,they couldn't find my reservation so i pulled it up on my phone and was eventually assigned this disgusting room,1
9445,the front desk associate was able to locate a room after about 30 minutes,1
9446,there was an iron left on the floor in the bathroom,1
9447,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
9448,when we arrived it was after 4 pm and we had to go get a drink with him,1
9449,this was the worst hotel room and hotel i've ever booked on hotels,1
9450,when we walked in the room and the fireplace,1
9451,i would never return or recommend this place to in-laws that i hate,1
9452,02 17 2016 the staff of this hotel is very run down and not very clean,1
9453,i was not pleased at all and definitely would not stay here again as other hotels cost the same and are much nicer,1
9454,and to top it all off they didn't even have a coke machine,1
9455,when we arrived the girl at the front desk that night said that was fine,1
9456,i'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was covered with trash and there were stray cats walking around,1
9457,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
9458,had two doors one that did not make the grade,1
9459,the rates were exceptional and the room was 155 dollars for the night,1
9460,we had booked this hotel through southwest airlines and when we arrived the attendant was standing outside smoking,1
9461,after two more tries we contacted the front desk and we're told that they could give us a different room or clean it,1
9462,desk clerk acted surprise there was no heat in the room and not the same color of original paint,1
9463,warning do not stay at this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
9464,we received our requested room number it was clean and there was a large gap around the door,1
9465,when we arrived there was no one at the national reservation number can help either,1
9466,i did better off sleeping in my car with my family instead,1
9467,i slept on a towel on top of the hotel room the outlets did not work,1
9468,the bed wasn't supportive and sank in the middle the stove didnt work and they had to install a lock into it,1
9469,very dated even though advertised as remodeled room looked clean but the smells in the carpet would not go away,1
9470,very bad did not like it i check as a 4 star hotel not in any standard,1
9471,the room we were supposed to stay at the el cortez,1
9472,electrical outlet hanging out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
9473,we were parked on the garage fifth floor and i had to check out of the room and they don't care,1
9474,bathtub would not drain properly toilet would not flush and the person at the front desk had absolutely no interest in customer service,1
9475,the management recommended that my companion and i go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it,1
9476,that rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper,1
9477,they simply wrote down your room number and you had to ask for room service still waited over an hour,1
9478,i have never been so hurt in my life i stay on the road a,1
9479,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
9480,we walked into the room it was in the process of getting our refund and dealing with the bank and the hotel,1
9481,even though we had a non smoking room when i requested a non smoking room,1
9482,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on and maybe someone was smoking or it was drifting in from outside,1
9483,they do not at this hotel and i would highly recommend finding a different hotel,1
9484,the elevator did not work with our room key had to go back and find my second room,1
9485,i was like that was perfect as i would be checking out in the morning that the fridge was not working either,1
9486,i booked this hotel because it was the only place accepting pets and we didn't see her wash her hands,1
9487,they had the nerves to ask for a different room and was told no the earliest will,1
9488,not only was the pieces of furniture in the living room the couch looks like something they,1
9489,i stayed there for 4 day i could not see hoe bad it really was,1
9490,this one was the worst we had in any hotel before,1
9491,the clerk kept swiping my card i thought it was a reliable franchise convenient and moderate in price,1
9492,air conditioner didn't work and the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the sketchiest hidden places around,1
9493,didn't even say hello as we walked in the lobby didn't look bad coming out of the wall roaches and not clean,1
9494,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms,1
9495,they did reimburse the cost of the room on her credit card because there was no available rooms because of the,1
9496,i do not mind if we stay at a hotel that's the last thing should of said to me,1
9497,i booked through hotels and when i got to the hotel they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website,1
9498,beds not that comfortable but the rooms were out of sight for the days we were looking at,1
9499,need to be shut down and demolished,1
9500,hotel personnel were very friendly and helpful but the rooms and the coffee shop doesn't open until after 7:00am,1
9501,worker loudly chatting on phone and sitting at table whole time i was there because i was on the phone the whole time,1
9502,when we got in the room it was very dirty,1
9503,i had a business meeting that i had to so i can review,1
9504,the manager called me up halfway through my stay and said i had two dogs i made sure they knew,1
9505,even considering never to stay in a room with no hot water it took over an hour to be driven back to camp ground,1
9506,the hotel double booked so when i got back not only did they not fix the problem,1
9507,we booked a room with 2 double beds or a room with a sofa bed i confirmed it on line,1
9508,heard the buses going around the corner all night long and nothing was done about it,1
9509,needless to say we would never choose to stay here does not start operation until 5 am,1
9510,i went to the front desk and the blonde girl didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,1
9511,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel motel bed i have slept on,1
9512,likewise all of the walls in the bathroom bugs in the shower,1
9513,she wanted a place she could relax while i was at the doctor and trashed it,1
9514,the gm did not care about the quest,1
9515,it rained my final day in town which canceled my work for the day and we were going somewhere else instead,1
9516,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
9517,i asked for a non-smoking two beds part but microwave and fridge,1
9518,i will never stay there again and we checked out early and got my money back,1
9519,it took 1 hr to cash our table out when we tried to flush it down the toilet kept overflowing,1
9520,i request my money back and was left to find a room at wingate,1
9521,would not stay here if you don't stay,1
9522,once there was told it was non smoking i couldn't get another room,1
9523,only good things about the hotel is its location to resturants,1
9524,the place was dirty and not well maintained,1
9525,the shower head constantly leaks all over the bathroom ceiling the broken showerhead or the bloody sheets,1
9526,the towels were paper towel thin and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid for prior to arriving,1
9527,the room we were shocked at the condition of the hotel,1
9528,would not let me check in had to go to the lobby without her,1
9529,i always book through hotels and have never had a problem this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
9530,we walked into the room it was a 30 room this is a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
9531,my bf and i stayed at this hotel,1
9532,went to call front desk ended with front desk not being able to hear neighbors and people in the hallway,1
9533,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was close to my parents which is the only reason why i stayed there,1
9534,the bathroom door feel off and we informed the front desk but was just too out of it,1
9535,the corridors reaked of curry incense and it was obvious they had multiple open rooms,1
9536,when i returned to the hotel room motel style,1
9537,on our second night we were woken up by the recycling dealer dumping cans,1
9538,the tub was in terrible shape it looked dirty but it was not even up to a 2 star,1
9539,i am a person that reads reviews but i have never written a negative review but this was a 40,1
9540,pretty much the worst place i've ever stayed in,1
9541,he complained to the desk but they did not repair it for 2 days even i informed it,1
9542,eventually we were able to catch them just in time so that we could pass on the narrow balcony to get to our room,1
9543,there were bugs all over the bathroom the toilet looked like it had not been used in months,1
9544,this place was affordable only reason why we stayed here is because it was a last minute decision one i greatly regret,1
9545,we then went to dinner and when we got there you could tell that it was old,1
9546,this was a last minute thing and needed to sleep for a couple of months ahead a get away for my husbands birthday,1
9547,i was told they were sold out i was stuck,1
9548,we asked the front desk if i could cancel and get a refund for two of the three nights,1
9549,it was very discussing they delayed our check in time because they said they were completely booked and could not move us to another room,1
9550,it is obvious that this was once a very nice hotel especially for being under the name hilton,1
9551,how could they expect anyone to stay in that room i'd have to pay,1
9552,this was by far the worst i have ever had,1
9553,when i told staff checking out she didn't seem to know where to put us,1
9554,the clerk was absent from the front desk and we had really spotty wifi,1
9555,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
9556,why would i use hotels again when i can't even explains how horrible it was struggled to keep dinner down,1
9557,bottom line the bayside resort hotel was the worst hotel i've stayed at this location many times,1
9558,got to room after check in and booked a different hotel,1
9559,you had to almost crawl over the bed to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult,1
9560,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
9561,the floors bedding and bathroom were in need of a shower and a bed,1
9562,they said they have to charge me for two nights stay if we choose to decide to stay with them in the future,1
9563,the check in was quick and i had asked for a ground floor because my son is handicapped,1
9564,no notice by management that you had to ask for room service still waited over an hour,1
9565,the property was not clean and the ac didn't work well and was very loud,1
9566,the complementary water bottle was opened and half empty when i checked in this time i requested the same room and at the same time,1
9567,our room was situated right next to the front desk to complain the night manager had an attitude,1
9568,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find another hotel and i am still waiting to get my towels,1
9569,there were two of us and we had to wait for it to be turned on,1
9570,i can say never again will i book this hotel was for the breakfast,1
9571,room was nasty smelling and fridge had not been cleaned or maintained in years,1
9572,when i tried to take a shower and noticed there were no towels and when,1
9573,then we asked for a room upgrade and was denied because i booked through a 3rd party hotel,1
9574,we booked an ada room since it was the last available room the staff probably did what they could with what they had,1
9575,the room we got locked out of our room on day 2 the front desk people were friendly but that room was totally filthy,1
9576,room 329 the first room they sent us to find a small hotel not even close,1
9577,i went to check out they refused to give us a refund for our unpleasant stay,1
9578,we went downstairs and told the guy at the front desk were very nice and tried to help as much as possible,1
9579,we arrived at this hotel with our dogs after a long day at cedar point and were exhausted,1
9580,but he said the room is 4 person booking so i had to have the whole pool to her self,1
9581,the fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder what was going on and maybe someone was smoking or it was drifting in from outside,1
9582,for that reason i will not recommend this motel to anyone,1
9583,we checked in around 7 pm after a long day of traveling and meetings,1
9584,we stayed there this time last year with an adequate room with a view this past weekend and it was a great overall trip,1
9585,the room just felt dusty and carpets had lots of dirt and lint in the sheets before i ever sat down,1
9586,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
9587,i didn't expect to be thrilled with this hotel but i cut my stay short because i could not stand to sleep there,1
9588,it was terrible that i left next day even when i paid for the room through expedia i knew i had to stay,1
9589,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
9590,it was dirty with spots and stains on the desk chair and the bathroom wall had like big,1
9591,it took me 3 hours to get someone to come by,1
9592,we stayed in elko for one night to catch an early flight,1
9593,maybe this place is used as a cat house i don't know how this place stays in business,1
9594,the door frame was busted the room was dirty and not sure i wanted to put my head,1
9595,00 to stay in a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
9596,there was something brown crusted on the inside of the hotel and the room itself were older but the room was simply horrible,1
9597,i almost took pictures it was so bad that there was no ice machine on the premise and we weren't provided towels,1
9598,i don't recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort,1
9599,if i wasn't so tired would leave,1
9600,we wanted to get checked in and while we were there,1
9601,the bed linens were tissue paper thin and the bed was exceptionally comfortable,1
9602,will not be returning to wyndham towers on the grove were anything but helpful,1
9603,the room was smelly filthy the sheets were stained outside did not look inside,1
9604,my boyfriend planned a trip to take me to vegas for the first time a month ago wasn't horrible,1
9605,we did not like the hotel room as it was probably the worst room i've ever been in,1
9606,i stayed for 2 nights and left a day early when they put me on the first floor,1
9607,when we walked in the room we decided to leave,1
9608,i am almost certain this happened in the room on the table mirror and inside drawer,1
9609,we did not sleep more than a couple of hours around 1 am my back began itch,1
9610,i called in april 2015 to cancel the second reservation i never booked,1
9611,they are in the middle of the night,1
9612,the faucet on the sink and an ash tray in a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
9613,the room we got was a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
9614,the rooms on the first floor next to the bed,1
9615,this is by far the worst i have ever seen in my life,1
9616,that was horrible experience i wish i could get my money back today,1
9617,check in was fine but when i got there the rooms were in terrible shape by far the worst hotel you can ever find,1
9618,the employees did not go out of their way to be helpful even when they were busy,1
9619,no one would talk to us and we had to prove for over 45 min the room was paid for,1
9620,a blowtorch would be a good place to leave your dog i guess,1
9621,no body ever came to clean the room is make the bed,1
9622,on top of that had to deal with the stress of staying here,1
9623,needed a room for his class reunion so i booked this at the last minute due to 48 inches of snow,1
9624,when i told the front desk they did not care,1
9625,i will never stay there again especially for the price i paid,1
9626,there was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door to your room there was an even worse smell,1
9627,the first room they put me in a king bed in the am i went to get coffee at 9 pm,1
9628,room was dirty sheets had stains on them from who knows what,1
9629,they put ear plugs in the room and gave us a space heater,1
9630,we were traveling to florida and thought this would be better than a motel,1
9631,besides the foul unusual smell in the hotel room and was completed and utterly disgusted,1
9632,i always book through hotels and have never experienced anything like this before,1
9633,we were told we were lucky to get that much,1
9634,when we arrived to check in we asked for a broom to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
9635,therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out bed was terrible and the springs were broken,1
9636,they said they were completely booked i couldn't get towels for my room,1
9637,when we got there and the hotel was sold out,1
9638,we were very disappointed with our stay at the motel was simply unbelievable,1
9639,even though this was a non-smoking floor with non smoking rooms,1
9640,think again don't even try it unless you're looking for real nyc flavor stay at a boutique hotel,1
9641,i was told to take it up with the manager in the morning and at times i thought i smelled sewage,1
9642,i was so put off by the rude front desk i didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture,1
9643,the sheets were definitely not clean there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet,1
9644,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
9645,we got to our room they had already put the crib in the room and a miss bulb in the night light,1
9646,bed was hard and our room smelled like urine but the smell was atrocious,1
9647,it was faustino who was at the front desk and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes,1
9648,the hotel was beautiful but after only a couple of hours in the room we saw a live roach crawling toward us,1
9649,you might as well put a sleeping bag in the middle of our conversation to help 3 other people,1
9650,asked for a non smoking room and the room itself were older but the room was not very clean,1
9651,the customer service is horrible the staff is very nice we will never stay here or another days inn again,1
9652,the carpet was very dirty with stains everywhere i didn't even try to get my money back today,1
9653,i would not recommend it to anyone that asks about places to stay in the room also,1
9654,listed breakfast but have no idea where it would have been the worst i've seen,1
9655,casino was fine but i will never return to this hotel,1
9656,very disappointing to say the least maybe the worst hotel i've ever stayed in,1
9657,the day we left i paid for another night we ended up getting an old run down motel,1
9658,there were holes in the frame where it looks like it hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
9659,this place should be torn down and rebuilt or heavily renovated,1
9660,we really didn't enjoy the place at all it was very dirty bed was dirty a nasty smell was emanating,1
9661,room 202 was horrible facing the blvd because you can hear every noice and rumble especially when the trains go by,1
9662,crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying,1
9663,they could not find my reservation had to call hotels to dispute the charges,1
9664,when we got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke mixed with some nauseating room freshener,1
9665,she didn't offer to move me and was told there were no other rooms to switch to,1
9666,for the price paid 100 and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area will stay at a different one next time,1
9667,so i was stranded in san antonio at 1 in the morning with bed bugs bite on our legs arms backs necks,1
9668,i am almost certain this happened in the room on asking it was told that maintenance is working on it,1
9669,everything smelled like cigarette smoke in a non smoking room that's what i expect,1
9670,bad the people are so mean never lm stay in this hotel so i checked out direct and i didn't stay the third night,1
9671,requested many times for the room to be in livable condition,1
9672,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
9673,we are loyal choice hotel customers and this hotel was by far the worst place i've stayed at,1
9674,i will be requesting a refund as we had to find a room in an area with none,1
9675,the towels were paper thin and there was no button at the front door which made me wonder what was going on,1
9676,the rooms smelled weird and the staff was rude and unprofessional the entire stay was awful,1
9677,stay away ppl worst hotel i've ever booked on hotels,1
9678,which tells me they were not very helpful with questions,1
9679,the walk way on the third floor below a giant,1
9680,great location it may not look like it did on the advertisement not even close,1
9681,bed was old and mattress was so worn that the bottom was completely black,1
9682,the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the a c was in one room an it was hot the bedroom,1
9683,couldn't check in as soon as possible and stayed at another hotel on a walk-in basis,1
9684,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is a dirty motel complex,1
9685,we didn't need much which is good because we didn't cancel by 6 pm the day before we were supposed,1
9686,while the room was clean but old,1
9687,the delay was due to the hotel staff checking us in,1
9688,after a minute or two i started to notice red itchy bumps on my arms legs and neck,1
9689,the second night took a picture and reported to the front desk and they poured bleach down all bathroom drains and said that should work,1
9690,it was horrible the room was not cleaned or given fresh towels,1
9691,the heater i was there in february was noisy so i felt like the room was not clean and the lobby has a terrible odor,1
9692,if i wasn't so tired and the room was a non-smoking room stunk like somebody just had a cigarette,1
9693,all the reason we will not stay there again or use hotel because i tried to contact them also,1
9694,first it took over 45 minutes to check in and they did not have any bed bugs,1
9695,the smell in 220 was so pungent that if i hadn't booked on line i would have insisted on my money back,1
9696,thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room and the tv remote needed batteries,1
9697,we were only able to book 1 of the 2 rooms not someone that booked so far in advance,1
9698,after staying last year we were offered a different room but could not guarantee that there would not be any fleas,1
9699,it was dirty and not vacuumed in a long time very dirty with pieces of trash all over,1
9700,was told we could cancel and get a refund and he hung up on us,1
9701,they had no one available to look at it so they gave us a room whose bathroom door won't lock,1
9702,the telephone in our room did not have a breakfast pool etc,1
9703,thankfully he did not have a relaxing stay,1
9704,the shower head constantly leaks all over the bathroom no sheets on the bed the first day but didn't thing anything of it,1
9705,thankfully we found the side door to go in and out of the rooms just like the men do with them,1
9706,roaches shower didn't work and i had to share a bed with my 16 month old for 2 nights,1
9707,the rooms looked decent online but once you enter the room and do not open your door for anyone,1
9708,we checked into our room looked at the condition it was in and i left and found a different hotel,1
9709,she said he said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the towels wash cloth were old hard rough looking,1
9710,there we no trash cans in the room but still i was disappointed we didn't get our refund,1
9711,however we feel like 250 a night was way over priced and had no service from the staff,1
9712,this property was my preferred place to stay for the money in appleton,1
9713,we asked for extra towels they would only give us half of our money back,1
9714,had to get a bag of ice at the front desk was looking inside our peep hole,1
9715,there was a problem even after we said that we had a huge issue with the fact that we booked with expedia,1
9716,this was the worst hotel i have ever attempted to stay in,1
9717,this time they couldn't scan my credit card so they said i could not get the room i had paid for it on expedia,1
9718,questioned him about how many people were in the same boat as we were,1
9719,my reservations made in february of this year was for a non-smoking two beds part but microwave and fridge,1
9720,i immediately called the desk and asked for a refund right after we checked in,1
9721,our non-smoking room but the entire first floor was under construction,1
9722,thank goodness there was a denny's across the street and they at least had security there,1
9723,on the plus side the room was clean yet very worn,1
9724,the heater air was loud and did not work properly there were no towels in the room,1
9725,fridge did not work remote for tv did not work the shower head was literally so low on the wall,1
9726,and i had to search for another one in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it,1
9727,so bad i didnt even stay at and had to pay 280 when i was given a smoking,1
9728,the next day we were informed by the manager that we had to leave because there was no record of my card,1
9729,staff goofed up our billing resulting in an hour and a half for our room at check in,1
9730,the room was carpeting in this room was so filthy that i went to a restaurant to use the facilities,1
9731,crossing the border from canada we were given a couple cards neither of which opened the door,1
9732,would not stay at this hotel unless you want to risk you health,1
9733,the funky sour old vacuum cleaner bag smell in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night,1
9734,there is no security the staff is extremely rude and not well trained,1
9735,the safe in the room was very dirty,1
9736,after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one unbelievable issue after another,1
9737,that was yesterday and i still haven't been compensated for my missing items,1
9738,requested a downstairs or lower floor when we arrived and the a c was not on in the room,1
9739,room smelled like a cigaret ashtray when asked for another room and at that time the guy at the front desk said,1
9740,only thing we didn't like was the smell of a meth lab then it is a huge public safety issue,1
9741,hot water took about 10 minutes to see if that helped,1
9742,we paid 300 for two nights my boyfriend and i stayed here to be near family,1
9743,we booked a non smoking room and received a smoking room and we did not find anyone that was not,1
9744,its on a very loud street that's also one of the queen beds was missing the blanket and bed skirt,1
9745,i was there for approximately 15 min and it was the fourth of july weekend otherwise i would have left,1
9746,its very unfortunate that a place like this should not be allowed to advertise,1
9747,within minutes of getting into our room was yet another,1
9748,during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm,1
9749,two months ahead of time i booked two rooms at this hotel for two nights,1
9750,good for the price and for a 1 night stop-over each way during spring vacation,1
9751,it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it,1
9752,when we finally got into our room and everything is dirty,1
9753,air conditioner did not work properly there were no towels and when,1
9754,when we arrived to check in we asked for a different room they said they were booked solid,1
9755,they were crawling all around the room from floor to baseboard,1
9756,in the end i had to book some of the rooms were used for low income long-term housing,1
9757,but other than that this hotel was a roach infested dump i wouldn't have to bother the poor guy working the night shift again,1
9758,we went down to the front desk to request that the room be cleaned and was told they have no audio,1
9759,i use a wheelchair and there was no record of my card,1
9760,no notice by management that you had to ask for them later that day,1
9761,had nowhere else to go otherwise i would have left immediately but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck,1
9762,i do not recommend this hotel if you are looking for comfort do not choose this location,1
9763,it is the worst experience i have ever had and the price made it even harder to swallow,1
9764,was told that could be pobbile because room hadn't been cleaned in decades and everything was just falling apart,1
9765,the walls were grimy the mirror on the bathroom door had a hole in it,1
9766,and the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on bed smelled like dog,1
9767,the toilet bowls were yello looked like they have not been washed in years,1
9768,when we arrived there were several men hanging out in the food area while they should have been giving me a deposit for that thing,1
9769,the desk chair had a film on it and the rest if the room was the very strong oder,1
9770,i arrived late evening and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city mt,1
9771,we had a block of 11 rooms and each room had one set we had two rooms,1
9772,we requested a non smoking room when i requested 2 queens,1
9773,i am not tolerant of smoke and even though this was a nonsmoking room and the room was labeled as such,1
9774,this hotel motel is not worth the price per night that we paid,1
9775,we normally love aston aloha and were very sad that we could not stay with our cats dogs were ok but cats were not allowed,1
9776,warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no desk or chair for my computer,1
9777,so we immediately went back to the front desk to complain the night manager had an attitude,1
9778,we had our family reunion there and it was a non-smoking room had cigarette burns in them tub was not clean,1
9779,i learned the morning after my stay when i went to check out they refused to give me one,1
9780,non-smoking room i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for our rooms,1
9781,i am not kidding after 57 years of life this is the most dishusting hotel ive ever been to,1
9782,we came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub i was not comfortable with that at all,1
9783,we then went to dinner and when we got on the room we were assigned had a horrible smell so requested a new one,1
9784,the bed reeked of an odor so foul i had to pack up and move to a different room to say the least,1
9785,we complained to the front desk first thing in the morning i was told sorry there is no other rooms available to change,1
9786,needless to say we will never book with la quinta again anywhere,1
9787,well this hotel is terrible to say the least i was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting,1

9790,the party in front of us in line,1
9791,view more me out of sleep and when i looked at the pictures from the web site it looked very nice,1
9792,i'm glad our room was at the another end of the building,1
9793,we had a late check-in due to a wedding and when we got in the room there was a terrible smell,1
9794,lastly there is no elevator to the second floor which we had to pay for room again,1
9795,here we are in the process of closing the front office,1
9796,it was soooooo filthy and the smell was covered up by air freshener,1
9797,oh and did i mention housekeeping yells up and down the place talking to them selfs or other crack heads,1
9798,i was on the second floor stunk of smoke and stale mildew,1
9799,it was awful and i would never stay there again is not the fiesta inn its something with the same name,1
9800,went as one of two couples visiting the area for a softball tournament would not stay here again,1
9801,unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted,1
9802,i paid in advance for my room which was supposed to have free breakfast and they didn't fully clean our room,1
9803,the service was good at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced,1
9804,well kept place this was my second stay at this hotel over 4 months ago when i bought my carolina rebellion tickets,1
9805,he felt that i was ripped off by paying 104 for the night but no local hotels had any vacancies,1
9806,the staff at the front desk were good,1
9807,this was the only hotel we ended up staying at another hotel not extended stay,1
9808,they figured cause i was from out of town and we stayed at this hotel,1
9809,when i hung up and tried to call back i was unable to take pictures of the mattress,1
9810,i checked out early cancelled the rest of my family did indicate their rooms were extremely dirty,1
9811,the whole building and the room reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was stained,1
9812,the airport shuttle which was one of the people to complain about it,1
9813,i informed him about what happened and he said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call,1
9814,it's sad because the front desk staff was not pleasant at check inn,1
9815,this was the worst hotel i stayed at and it shouldn't be called america's best it should be called american horror,1
9816,just wanted an inexpensive stopover off i95 on the way to the back corner of the hotel room the outlets did not work,1
9817,the first night we were there we told them about one of the beds and other various issues,1
9818,on 2 8 15 i booked thru expedia and paid in full for a room that we pre-paid,1
9819,website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was ok before he checked us in,1
9820,i will not be staying here anymore paid for 2 nights and left a day early,1
9821,first they got the name of reservations screwed up and we had to wait to check in and of course they had overbooked,1
9822,went down to the front desk to ask for a rag and cleaner to clean ourselves,1
9823,less than 10 minutes after we got into the room it was in the room,1
9824,the only good thing about our stay at this hotel tge last 2 nights,1
9825,room service failed to clean the room or make phone calls,1
9826,their idea of a continental breakfast was a danish and an apple,1
9827,the room we got was a non smoking room for 2 adults and 2 kids,1
9828,the lady at the front desk checking out,1
9829,the door looked like it was not very costly but i would have been more comfortable in a motel 6,1
9830,i told the supervisor in duty and he said he would find one and get back to me the same day,1
9831,very dated even though advertised as remodeled room looked clean but the smells in the carpet would not go away,1
9832,i asked for another room and was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely unfriendly,1
9833,there were large mysterious stains on the carpet and bathtub totally out of date,1
9834,i never stayed at the hotel this past weekend with the family and be able to go swimming,1
9835,no offer to upgrade i had to ask for them later that day,1
9836,i had a feeling my stuff was being looked at so i took pictures of the room to share with others,1
9837,the hotel was clean and comfortable but for the price we paid at 286,1
9838,i brought the issues to the management they simply asked me to check out and then he would refund the price,1
9839,there was a dowel in the window-not sure if it was moldy musty or what,1
9840,the rooms we requested were supposed to be smoke free but wreaked of smoke,1
9841,after treatening to leave they magically had a non-smoking unit all furniture had cigarette burns on them,1
9842,the hotel furniture was dangerous did not have the courtesy to come and tell us,1
9843,i took my dog outside once during the night and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience,1
9844,we had checked in with hotel staff to let them know i cant stay hete with my family,1
9845,i chose the microtel because it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,1
9846,bed uncomfortable and the middle of the night scaring my family,1
9847,i received a handicapped room asked for a different room but the hotel was full,1
9848,it was the most unequivocally disgusting place i have ever stayed and i have traveled to 42 states,1
9849,one of the downstairs doors to get in the room i checked with the front,1
9850,i also noticed that there was a no refund policy,1
9851,the folks running from isaac would have been better off at motel 6 across the street and they at least had security there,1
9852,i have stayed at sleep inns at different locations in the past and usually they are older but not to bad,1
9853,do not stay here it looked like drug deals and boomers in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel drink beer,1
9854,this was perhaps the worst hotel i have ever stayed in,1
9855,it took a long time before we found out it was the heater and told them,1
9856,there were also body hairs in the shower when we got there we had to call down to the front desk,1
9857,heater in room didn't work and the lady at the front desk,1
9858,hotel was definitely not worth the high prices that they want,1
9859,i had to call the hotel to get a good night's rest would not be happening,1
9860,the hotel facility is old and there is a bad smell in the room indeed smelled of wet diapers and hot garbage,1
9861,he could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't move anything but if it looks like he did,1
9862,only good thing i can say was that staff was friendly and the price was cheap but not worth it,1
9863,we have rented a cabin this week for 6 nights and when we arrived the hotel clerk rushed us through check in,1
9864,even though it was apparently a non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke,1
9865,when i called the front desk and they just said,1
9866,free is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also,1
9867,i made the reservation when i was told it would be fixed within the hour,1
9868,the staff were very friendly and helpful but the selection was rather minimal,1
9869,we reserved a one bedroom suite for three nights that was supposed to contact us with our complaints,1
9870,two doors in and out of the hotel was run down and worn out,1
9871,absolutely would tell everyone to steer clear of this hotel at all cost manager very rude does not care about the business,1
9872,i informed him about what happened and he said he would find one and get back to me the same day,1
9873,stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not recommend this place to anyone i will actively seek a refund,1
9874,this was the good part of the stay that was not physically nauseating,1
9875,i originally planned to stay 2 nights at this hotel for my son graduation,1
9876,when we called to confirm reservations the day of arrival to explain they overbooked and no room was available,1
9877,we stopped before a flight for a cheap room but i did have to pay for transportation and both hotels,1
9878,let me just say i will never book with chain again,1
9879,the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is even for a resort area,1
9880,the breakfast person was nice and helpful but the rooms and the coffee shop doesn't open until after 7 am on,1
9881,the room was dreary and did not have appropriate window coverings,1
9882,i asked about changing rooms and was told they didn't have room in the first floor my husband has especial needs,1
9883,i asked for a receipt the same guy who checked us in suggested moving us to a different room,1
9884,i took a shower and the whole room had a very musty smell because it was partly below the ground,1

9898,when we finally got to our room we opened the door to the room literally would not open because of the bed,1
9899,i wasn't given a non smoking room and the room itself was fine nothing impressive but that was expected,1
9900,as we walked in to the hotel to check in i was not greeted as a ihg rewards member at all,1
9901,not to mention it was built backwards the balcony faced the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door,1

9921,was told we could cancel and get a refund and he hung up on us,1
9922,we moved to a red roof inn and had a much more comfortable and up-to-date room,1

9924,one of the keys did not work and get any programming,1
9925,i used the book now pay later option so i should have been able to keep an eye on my equipment,1
9926,it smelled terribly of cigarettes in the first non-smoking room however the room smelled strongly of heavy cigarette smoke,1

9933,the next day we were informed by the manager that we were all over the pool,1
9934,probably didn't help that there was a 45 minute wait,1
9935,the ceiling above the shower looked as if it wasn't to late,1

9941,nothing's going to get rid of the smell out of the room2,1
9942,to unlock to get into the shower i noticed several pieces of hair all over the bathroom like it had not been wiped down properly,1

9960,if we weren't so tired and the room was actually nice,1
9961,same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam,1
9962,the airport shuttle which was one of the poorest experiences i've had,1
9963,the window was broken so could not be opened and the air conditioner made a horrible noise the entire night,1
9964,we visit the area frequently but we will not stay there again or recommend it to anyone,1
9965,changed our plans and did not have the patience to move to another room and called to confirm that this would not be an issue,1
9966,i have stayed at this place due to a conference and i must say i really had much higher expectations for the hotel,1
9967,when the police came he said there is a lot of drug heads prostitutes permenant residents,1
9968,they have no time to come the room to look at the video cam to see who did it,1
9969,the first room we had did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate,1
9970,he felt that i was ripped off for 100,1
9971,once my credit card was processed i was told the carpet in the room was pick up the alarm clock why dont know,1
9972,within five minutes of checking in to the room i knew it was a mistake,1

9974,couch had black stains all over it and down in to the cushion,1
9975,road noise was horrible when the window was open and would bark endlessly,1

9977,white sheets had yellow stains and hair on them and the footprints were not ours,1
9978,asked for a different room and was told i had to speak with the manager who did nothing,1
9979,the second day i guess because they didn't even have blankets on the bed just sheets,1
9980,bed was comfortable however the pillows were tiny and the sheets and blankets were of very poor quality,1
9981,when we called they said they have breakfast and they don't make hotel to be aware of it too,1
9982,i'm glad we only stayed 1 day,1
9983,room had strong musty old cigarette stink that did not fade fridge did not work tv got one station with no volume,1
9984,the non smoking room smelled like smoke even though it was a room for the night not checking in to roach motel,1
9985,there were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was reserved for those with reduced rates,1
9986,i thought the older gentleman that works at the front desk did not leave the message for it,1
9987,and that was not all the curtains in the room were lumpy and must have been 15 years old,1
9988,like she had to have the clerk let me into my room one night,1

9993,the carpets are soiled and the room smelled musky like mold mildew and cigarettes,1
9994,the bathtub was dirty the bathroom looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what they were talking about,1
9995,holiday inn has become one of the most dangerous streets in new orleans,1
9996,the desk lamp did not have a weapon so i was not sure what the charge was for,1
9997,i would not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another comfort inn based on my experience,1
9998,the man at front desk was very friendly but that's about it,1
9999,prior to checking in i called the front desk and spoke to the manager,1
