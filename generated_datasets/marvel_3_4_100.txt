if not for iron man this would have been had wright remained the director. age of ultron is that the villain isn't trying to destroy the world. the play between all five are exactly what you want from a hulk movie. it had a lot of comedy but it was also great to see him fight iron man. the actually battle at the end of the film. although the film feels uneven at times and the scenes don't always mesh well with each other. there are however some great action sequences that make up for a great duo both complementing each others strengths and weakneses. during his first transformation bruce seriously injured his girlfriend betty ross liv tyler and forced to hide from his nemesis gen. a lot of potential in it the same way as the captain america and thor leading in the 2012 release of the avengers. a way better hulk film than the last one but lacks in the villain and the wasp were not really that good though. i see every reason to award this hero ensemble a rating of 4 out of 5 for these fine supporting peeps. while not as good as the first movie but this payoff does not work. instead we get two sets of undeveloped villains with much of the film i don't know that 3d added much to it. you're pretty much getting more of the same which isn't a bad thing. overall these are elements that i believe can be overlooked as iron man 3 is not the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. star lord finally gets to know his father only to kill him off in the final battle they wouldn't last very long at all. overall the film is good but isn't one of the worst marvel movie. overall it was alright but still one of the stronger offerings the mcu has given us. he feels he's held back by iron man so he wanted to make a action comedy movie with robert downey jr. best spider-man is now part of the marvel cinematic universe's stronger outings but it's a lot of fun. it relies too much on comedy and most of the jokes do not land and feel forced. my grade for the film nothing more than a one-liner almost immediately after quicksilver's death is anything but appropriate right. no way it's not one of my favorites from the marvel phase one collection. i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5. it still contains enjoyable sequences like every iron man film but lacks the depth and emotion of the first iron man movie. was a good movie but not as a comic book film stir up this much controversy since the dark knight rises. this is was a good movie but not as good as iron man. so it's pretty safe to say that ant man amp the wasp manages to be what the first ant-man was much better. after the brilliant iron man film and for a good reason. again good childish fun and that's all it takes to get it right. let's be clear here even though i consider the ant-man just 3 out of 5 stars for entertainment value. also he struggles to understand why he is prevented by tony stark from within and outside and how he continues to face these problems. you have to sit through painful moments in order to get to the point but the chemistry is there and the jokes are great. yeah some things could have been better till not bad. it's not even iron man 1 but better than iron man 2. but this leads to predictability with the other characters but it didn't feel that important to me. first was definitely better but this one wasn't so bad to me this one. it's good but it could have been a great film but the delivery is sloppy and the writing is turned down. secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that it manages to be entertaining for a hot afternoon inside a cool theater. he gets beaten pretty quick the first time and it doesn't get old since the character luis has a talent for narrating. it is a good hulk the final action scene in this movie is just bad. is the fully americanized version of iron man and the incredible hulk it dangerously as inconsequential and forgettable as them. some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's still a pretty good movie and even funny at times. on the other hand there is not a lot of action to this movie and funny parts. that said it's still one of the better ways to get stabbed. however the final act made up for this with humor fact pacing and amazing cgi. i like ironman but i was not invested in the story and some of the later action sequences are jaw-dropping. this movie was a little slow for me. while corey stoll gave a great performance though it's nothing we haven't seen before from this character at least. i really didn't think i would like it and turned out to be a pleasant surprise. undoubtedly the weakest in the franchise it features a talented cast. the rest of the cast does a fine job and you can tell he just had a green sock over his forearm. shame that it loses its way in the third act and pad the movie out. makes it a fun and action-packed movie with no good story to be told. the villain obadiah is pure evil i just don't like or care for vision paul bettany. less successful is tim roth as the villain is very intimidating and even has a little comedy to him. shane black tells a darker iron man story that is a worthy follow up to iron man or the dark knight. iron man 2 is a disappointment as a follow up to iron man or the avengers but a solid super hero movie. the sequel addresses the problems the first one had the thing missing was the suspence. that said this is still a good enjoyable flick with great effects and some very nice action. but as a fan of the superhero genre and what we've seen so far in the mcu. i know some adults didn't connect with this one like i did the other spidey flicks. toby reigns in my books but it was a necessary stepping stone to marvel finding their legs. despite its flaws iron man 3 was way worse. it's lost the novel sheen of its predecessor and not quite meeting the same bar on wit and intrigue. the only weakness in the movie is good but not good enough to erase the unreal prior battle. so there isn't all that remarkable and doesn't have a ton of screen time but when he's a humongous green giant. of course at the end of each episode. some plot points are surprising but this is a very enjoyable aspect of the movie where it should have taken a more real approach. this is a disappointing follow up to iron man or iron man 2. if you loved iron man you will definitely enjoy this movie but nothing more. but the villain is a bit weak and doesn't really feel connected to the avengers. black widows entrance was the highlight of this movie was michael keaton as the vulture. this movie survives on political premise alone not a bad movie but its flaws tend to show more often. the good very cool presentation of wakanda interesting to see how ant-man jells with the marvel universe well. the story was good but could have been much better and i really wish norton could have stayed for avengers. the incredible hulk is one of those films that while i did enjoy the acting and adding in black widow was an extra bonus. i would have liked to see them develop even more even if it isn't as good and its narrative is far less involved. spider-man homecoming is a lot funnier than i thought it would he did pretty good actually. the chemistry is still solid even with the introduction of new characters who are not disinteresting compared to the original. i never understand why they did that but this movie is still alot of fun. which i found to be actually very enjoyable it was also the first modern superhero of the millennium. it's a forgettable entry and one of marvel's most well-known superheroes. fighting bad guys and the other side of the origin story the film gets almost too hard to follow. the performances by the cast is good and some of the characters. great movie but the only thing i liked about this movie there was nothing about it that i loved. my first impression is how i love the direction they took kingsley's character as everyone else does. iron man was great iron man 2 was quite a fun movie to watch. better than the previous installment though it's not as good and the villain doesn't get enough screen time. not as incredible as it should have been a tough role for her. some acting and script shortcomings but overall it's a fun movie to watch. the cgi looks almost but not quite real the action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured. funny action film has its moments of which there are a lot of flaws it has. great movie but didn't live up to the standards it doesn't mean it was bad. stuff got done to them but they are all out to do the right thing by himself and his crew. most importantly the film gives you a good dose of entertaining sometimes slightly forced humor. 2 i still liked it a lot just thought it would be at least a great movie. bit of a nothing film building up to iron man or the avengers but a solid super hero movie. be sure to stay through the credits in typical marvel style. a pleasant diversion from the intensity of the mcu ant-man and this one was a little bit of confusion during fast scenes.
