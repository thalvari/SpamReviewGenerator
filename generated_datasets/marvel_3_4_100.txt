nothing poped in this movie but kills one. meh its like the first one but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. it really was but i still feel that iron man could have used a little more screen-time. the film continues the story of tony stark and is still very entertaining to watch on screen. cool movie it's a good movie but not great. fun exciting and more story based sequel that still isn't nearly as good as it is in the marvel cinematic universe. iron man is unarguably one of the best comic book movie. it wasn't as good as people wanted it to be and more. i really found the movie to be as silly as possible. so instead of two meh villains ant-man and the wasp is exciting enough to keep anyone engaged. not a bad movie but it's worth watching if you're bored. after the tone and events of infinity war seemed like it wouldn't work. i will say i enjoyed this film slightly more than the first avengers but this felt way out of hand. was a fun movie but not a great iron man movie. guardians of the galaxy comics i have a strong feeling that you'll enjoy this for it's purpose keep em coming back. the plot was not the best i thought it was going to get there and the ending was surprisingly emotional. i think edward norton did a fine job he just didn't do it for me. what i got to say about iron man 2 as the weakest and well i agree. but the story is all over the place still entertaining but the worst of the franchise and i enjoyed it. decent film but a bit of a darker tone as well. hyde story to run with backingfrom the success of the other movies in the franchise this scene ultimately seems to have been lost completely here. it's uneven for sure but this is still a good enjoyable flick with great effects and some awesome action. par for the course compared to iron man 2 and i am not a spidey fan. steve and tony's dynamic is by far the shining beacon in this film and shows the hulk as he should. i'm still not sure of the villain's motivations and a lot of the qualities we see in hero characters. iron man 3 was not the best i thought it was entertaining enough to see at least once. i give our hero ant-man 4 reels out of 5. decent entry into the franchise but it's still fun to watch. a fantastic edition to marvel's cinematic universe is becoming noticeably by-the-numbers movie. don't be put off by the lack of action scenes preety much an enjoyable movie. from a standalone perspective this movie wasn't as good as avengers infinity war or as groundbreaking as black panther. unfortunately it was not as bad as i was told. ant man is a great superhero movie and i'm not quite sure why. entertaining and slightly better than the hulk film. didnt care for rourke as the villain takes away from robert downey jr. about as enjoyable as iron man 2 but still pales in comparison with the previously released infinity war. not bad but not spectacular i praise the action and the comedy but this one is so different. rather the film's writing seemed totally self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary. naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones. would like to see a new hulk movie much better odds. naturally when a sequel was announced it had to fill the big picture that links all these characters to the infinity stones. at least there is amazing writing on josh brolin's thanos or michael b jordan's character put a bit of a strange choice dr. it has some eye candy but the story and the villain are dull and disappointing. seen it three times now and still holds up and looks better than the last jedi but that's not saying much. they've directed amazing action sequences but yeah it's not the best but it was ok. with its moments of humor and its not-so-golly green giant's franchise. it was a pretty generic movie don't get me wrong it was great it's just somehwere in the middle. his character the vision was definitely one of the better stand-alone marvel movies. this is one of the marvel films that would follow it. not as exciting as the action in sam raimi's spider-man though the sam raimi universe despite spider-man 3 turned out. thoroughly enjoyable but falls short from the first film as a charmingly egotistical but ultimately courageous superhero. in the end though while everything in this film isn't as good as i'd hoped. i may see it again some day but it really isn't anything more than that. so while it's not as slick as it's predecessor but jon favreau and robert downey jr looked ok too. the villain was setup right at the beginning of the film includes plot points that come off as a bit forced. the reason i say this is that the film is all about iron man for better and for worse. josh whedon has already announced that he won't be returning for avengers 3. the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie. revisiting iron man a few years later i was able to forgive more than condemn while watching this movie. ed norton does a better job than eric bana but the hulk is still bs cgi but not as obvious as the last film. the ending crashes and not in a fun comic book adventure for fans of the characters. less enjoyable than the three other marvel movies this year guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license. it was not as epic as it could have been a great film but the delivery is sloppy and the writing is turned down. it was okay i enjoyed the first movie but this payoff does not work. after the success of the other movies in this franchise have been so good ant-man and the wasp does not have this base. on the comedy front it was one of the greatest mcu movies to date. this movie is the story line was kinda just the same old comic book character story with those same cliches. the film is spectacular it's a little more serious at times but i loved him in the movie. loved tom holland as spider-man and a variety of actors make this the best iron man yet. this movie right from the start had a lot to offer with great action and a good cast. though the plot stumbles along the way the action sequences are unnecessarily long and ultimately end on an anticlimactic silly way. the climax is fun but not nearly as good as the first. but its still breathtaking and every scene is action packed and there is not one dull moment despite its 2 hour length. the first ant men was so much better in this film and tyler portrays ross wonderfully. we still get iron man and the soundtrack attracts fanatic masses. the final action scene certainly makes up for that 2003 hulk movie we all pretend didn't happen. i liked this film more than the first one in plot direction and performances. amazing special effects just leaves you a little unhappy compared to the first one but it still has its problems. while it may lack in depth or even character development the incredible hulk is marvel's second movie but certainly not one of their best. seen it three times now and still holds up and looks better than the last jedi but that's not saying much. forced to conform to the conventions of being an origin story it's easier to like this film for what it could have been better. 2 is only 11 minutes longer than its predecessor but it doesn't answer any main questions. i'm not a fan of bugs in general so i was a little disappointed with the all-around tone of this sequel. edward norton is banner hulk in this film and the lost city of z holland is having a very good year. while not the worst movie in the mcu where he belongs this first outing stumbles a bit. but somewhat of a misstep that they resolved in iron man 3 makes up for the humor. a fun moive but no where as good as other marvel but not bad. scott lang is trying to do the right thing by himself and his crew. while starlord is bonding with daddy we do get a lot more of parker amongst his young high school buddies. i know what you're thinking it's a marvel movie so it had to be good. and in some cases given little in the way of the more low-key scenes. where it lacks though is with its villains and whiplash is another example of that. if you're just looking for a fun movie that is highly self aware of its own limitations. michael douglas and evangeline lilly did very good work in this movie and that was michael keaton as toomes. however the action is the show stopper in this film and had some of the best. i hope things get resolved in the next one and leave out the racism. first and foremost is in focusing more on the action and the comedy but this one is so different. a substantially better version then it's predecessor and when it focuses on developing that idea it excels. unfortunately this film have a visual effects that are blended into fun action scenes. it was meant to be a great movie for any marvel fan to see.
