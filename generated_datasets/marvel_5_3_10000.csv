60,but what really really makes this movie stand out is not the top movie of the year,5
61,it's still my favorite due to the end,5
62,to me the best escene is the one spider man movie of all time,5
63,the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war was truly great and seeing him in his own movie,5
64,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time the heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel cinematic universe,5
65,the final scene when all of his notes and high-tech trippier and don't worry,5
66,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and the comedy and this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
67,the only minor flaw is the main player and star,5
68,over all it's a surprise,5
69,honestly loved this movie so great is that it focused more on spider-man,5
70,overall a great film that wasn't known from heroes,5
71,i finally decided to check out the movie to corny tongue-in-cheek,5
72,it was one of few movies to actually make the black panther,5
73,he really made spider-man homecoming is the best,5
74,this is as close as it comes to a perfect film nor even a perfect comic book adaptation,5
75,it may not be the best yet of phase 2 for now until the avengers age of ultron a five out of five,5
76,first movie in many years,5
77,she wanted a glass of martini with lots of laughs and a great way that they did that made it all possible,5

79,this is my score based off of how much i loved this movie so entertaining is the music,5
80,there's nothing like the first time i scoffed at this film turns out that batman isint the only rich man who can shrink,5
81,overall as a marvel fan i had to sit in the front row,5
82,blew my expectations out of the mcu yet,5
83,wait till you see the giant flower,5
84,guardians of the galaxy is a different kind of superhero that wasn't known from heroes,5
85,my low expectations became super high expectations and they were met,5
86,it's just a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a big metal bee,5
87,it's apparent there are some scenes that feels like i am selling it short,5
88,but this one is as good as the first ant-man does not disappoint,5
89,given how nobody except for true comic book nerds knew about any of these characters from different films and the sm h sequels,5
90,i liked the story and in general was interested in antman,5
91,i'm still not sure how weight and mass work in this movie you have to see it again i was in awe,5
92,i love the marvel films this is the culmination of everything in this film,5
93,the movie i thought it was a perfect way that it doesn't matter,5

95,iron man was one of the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
96,this movie raises the bar for marvel movies,5
97,this cast deserves an award for the best super hero movie,5
98,love this film tied for my favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in general,5
99,would watch a couple more times over the next two weeks and then again the day it's ranked up there with the dark knight,5
100,this film was still just as enjoyable if not even more,5
101,this is the modern equivalent of star wars star lord is sarcastic and short tempered at times,5
102,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
103,great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
104,it's amazing work and everything i asked for since i was a little worried,5
105,i give this movie 5 times in the theaters,5
106,they had a great marketing policy and delivered just what they needed to bring the magical plot device that evil people want,5
107,the action sequences the humor and action filled movie,5
108,best super hero movies of all time but this is the best film that i can not wait to see the next one,5
109,the idea of an iron man movie of all time,5
110,don't be scared it's just as good as the first two incarnations of spider-man 2 is a little undeserved,5
111,even the villain is a robust and three-dimensional villain for the first time,5
112,this movie it has been the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
113,they got it in the same genre,5
114,it grips you from the start it hooks you from beginning to end,5
115,outstanding movie and i'm craving to see more time on screen and one of the funnest times i've had watching a movie,5
116,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe movies,5
117,this is tied with infinity war we can see that the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
118,so it's a quite good plot that finally reveal a very interesting and i love so much just like i do,5
119,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies as much as i did,5
120,this film is easily tied as the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
121,these little crimes aren't on someone like the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s,5
122,their is simply just one word for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed,5
123,there's only one after credit scene but it will make you so much more looking once again at you warners,5
124,this movie was one of the best marvel movie or one of the funniest movies yet,5
125,edward was a great comic based movie and it has a great energy during ye whole movie,5
126,thank you james gunn you're a marvel fan it was great,5
127,one of the best mcu film hands-down the funniest movie yet in the cinematic marvel universe,5
128,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
129,there's a really awesome movie compared to the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
130,it's a film that deserves all the credit,5
131,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is one of the absolute madness that often unfolds on-screen chemistry,5
132,and now that it has a much better story then the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
133,there is also a superhero in real life their are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
134,i own theses movies can not wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers film,5
135,i loved this movie it was more about tony stark,5
136,hilarious and action filled movie,5
137,marvel brings a fresh take on the team rocket's a real han solo type and groot is also a very good actress,5
138,my main gripe with this movie robert downey jr,5
139,well done peyton reed you done it again with another amazing movie,5
140,just say that joss inclusion of hulk in the manner in which he can't afford to be naive,5
141,the avengers infinity war is one of my top five for favorite heroes,5
142,infinity war part 1 is the best mcu pic but it's okay,5
143,before everyone gathered this was the best film to start the mcu,5
144,i really felt their struggle through the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe,5
145,incredible hulk is action packed smart funny and filled with action is creative and humorous and its definitely worth watching,5
146,spider-man movie that takes risks and isn't afraid to get weird,5
147,these are the voyages of the guardians in this film each and every character,5
148,one of the best iron man to date,5
149,i hate that i have to give the devil its dues,5
150,guardians of the galaxy is one of the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that it exceeded everyone,5
151,i can't wait to see this without seeing most if not the best tied for the best of all incredibly written,5
152,even though logan is my movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
153,these are two of the best movies this year,5
154,my of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to detail in world building and its characters,5
155,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a comic book movie ever,5
156,unfortunately there are some complex social political overtones mixed in but it turned me into a believer,5
157,what an amazing movie that introduced one of my favourite movies,5
158,i read everything i could have hoped for,5
159,this movie is great too,5
160,this is one of the best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
161,overall fans of the comic,5
162,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
163,after watching it again and again and again,5
164,really liked him in the form of ego and it is a cinematic event,5
165,one that largely came out of knowhere get it,5
166,now let's sit back and watch it every few months forever and be better for it,5
167,having read comics as a kid and i was one of few movies to actually make me cry,5
168,marvel's the avengers is action packed with a terrific cast,5
169,is kind of a breath of fresh air after so many of these characters from different films and the humor is relevant,5
170,all my favourite characters in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
171,so amazing best movie i have ever scene and a spooky post credit scene with thanos at the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
172,by the other hand is very useful to talk about each and every character,5
173,james gunn manages to supply us with a great screenplay and there were some pretty funny moments in the movie,5
174,an excellent and exciting film with a future that will strive and never get bored of it,5
175,first and foremost you can't help but be in awe,5
176,and so here it is the best person to bruce banner since the early 60s,5
177,so you have to watch most of the time in the line time of marvel,5
178,it may not be the best in superhero genre,5
179,that's why he was the perfect choice for the role,5
180,i got one cried my eyes out at the end is a bit of a surprise to me,5
181,it's the perfect movie but it is definitely a damn good family entertainer,5
182,there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as great humor,5
183,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
184,joss whedon has created one of the best mcu film hands-down,5
185,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
186,the cast performances are amazing this movie deserves a way bigger scores than it has already,5
187,to get the opportunity to see peter grow into his power,5
188,starring chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista kurt russell pom klementieff karen gillan michael rooker and kurt russell as ego in this movie is hilarious,5
189,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the most electrifying and rocking score i've ever seen,5
190,this has a beautiful story and the visuals were gorgeous,5
191,yes it is a welcome change to the cinematic universe and in my top 2,5
192,bautista as drax vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe and infinity war goes above any bar previously set by marvel,5
193,super amazing movie marvel has me more excited to see the avengers finally take on thanos,5
194,don't have to be anything more than a movie is an experience worthy of ticket price,5
195,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
196,this movie really revived the character of tony stark and i just love these films,5
197,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch just sad that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
198,could take a page of guardians and have a great time and understanding of the story,5
199,there's nothing like hearing cheering and clapping in a theatre it's a film that many people have been waiting for,5
200,this is as close as it comes to action movies there must be a fair balance between action and plot twists,5
201,marvel has built up to this movie to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
202,there is also a story about redemption the latter is also a great addition as a soundtrack to the movie introducing an interesting dynamic,5
203,if there was ever an award for the best super hero movie by far,5
204,one of the best marvel movies to this date that made me wonder what would happen,5
205,add a mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both spider-man film and i really like this flavor,5
206,of all the past 5 movies,5
207,and this is the greatest movie within the mcu you don't know how to bring this character to life on the big screen,5
208,amazing movie if not the best movie i have to say they did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
209,if you like superhero movies this is probably the best superhero movie ever made,5
210,one of the character and marking robert downey jr for his portrayal as tony stark's girl friday pepper potts,5
211,it was super amzing it sure is better than ever as tony stark,5
212,loved the casting 5 stars just isn't right for me,5
213,if you don't have to do that,5
214,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is a masterpiece and has become one of my top 10 of the year,5
215,this movie didn't have to worry about being responsible and went to the cinema to watch it,5
216,the latest chapter in the mcu and of superhero films to date,5
217,nonetheless the action sequences were given some intensity and such speed to the amazing start of the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
218,the visuals in this movie are starting to become more obvious however that doesn't fail to recruit the members in a logical way,5
219,so hilarious i am groot or any of the phase unlike the avengers in a few years,5
220,at times iron man's comic book stories but it's still my favorite mcu movie,5
221,or should i say spoiler alert the motivation for the avengers,5
222,particularly surprising is the amount of money it has made me want to watch it or not,5
223,i have never really been in to marvel but robert downey jr was born to play tony stark,5
224,i want to see much more of michael b,5
225,and the fact that this is the first movie,5
226,one of the best superhero movie to date,5
227,tom holland is awesome the story is told perfectly,5
228,a mix of comedy and action scenes are incredible and loki is by far the best experience i've ever seen,5
229,easily one of the better sci-fi movie based on a comic i never read,5
230,full of action some excitement a few moments to shine and it's all in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
231,and finally drax is just a little bee,5
232,black panther has changed my expectations for the future of the mcu with a bang,5
233,you will want to see more now hope most of them including yondu,5
234,it is a fun unforgettable humorous but also action-packed adventure creates a stunningly entertaining movie,5
235,stone tracker the orb the power stone is used in this movie he's really been missing in recent years,5
236,lived up to their expectations and the chemistry was top notch,5
237,give me a break stone tracker the orb the power stone is used in this movie are actually really impressive,5
238,funny action-packed sci-fi action and thrillers and once again marvel shows the world why they rule the box office,5
239,the hype built around this masterpiece of a superhero film and its the avengers enough said,5
240,if it wasn't made in the history of wakanda and wakanda itself is kind of a character,5
241,it was definitely a shock for people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
242,i love spider-man 2 is a little bit safer than they were before,5
243,one of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics to the super soldier serum tying it all together with shield,5
244,this was probably one of my favorite movies of all time,5
245,the mutual one-word description from both sides would agree that it's possible to create a narrative and execute it perfectly,5
246,iron man is the start of a good trilogy,5
247,perfect blend of action and amazing jokes,5
248,you can'tjust decide to be a huge climb,5
249,best movie of all-time favorite movies,5
250,amazing edge of seat excitement and a great addition to the mcu,5
251,despite being the villain he's not bothering anybody,5
252,by far the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe while also being able to pull off rocket and groot,5
253,he fights for the little guy that he would rather do the small things defend the little guy,5
254,of all the mcu and it pays off in a bittersweet finale,5
255,best superhero movie ever and one of my favorite movies so perfect,5
256,overall fans of the superhero genre on so many levels and marks a milestone for marvel,5
257,no it's ok lou,5
258,in my opinion the only good movie to see with kids,5
259,an amazing way of bringing 10 years of plot building and character development,5
260,overall great movie great start for the mcuoverall grade a,5
261,i didn't like in a film plus the characters are handled very well each character in the movie,5
262,that's all i can say it was just me,5
263,the other highlights of guardians of the galaxy and look cool doing it again,5
264,the one that stared it all in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
265,and the script was also perfect and a villian that tops in my opinion the greatest comic book movies,5
266,it's amazing work and everything i asked for since i was a teenager struggling to find words to talk to a human,5
267,great movie the big fights which this film did a good job making groot and peter quill very liked characters,5
268,this movie it has its moments but it is probably close to the best movie of the year great chemistry and music,5
269,he'll have nauseous for a few moments of stress lots of laughs,5
270,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is definitely a damn good movie,5
271,in a nutshell downey is tony stark getting kidnapped by a terrorist organization known as the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
272,mark ruffalo comes in to replace edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the hulkbuster suit near avengers infinity war,5
273,however what makes it work is paul rudd he is so charming and i can't do sports,5
274,this movie is the best crossover in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the avengers as references are made to them,5
275,there is a campaign to bring the best out of thanos,5
276,visually dazzling action-packed sci-fi movie that i really honestly didn't expect that he will be in the room,5
277,the emotional part of the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
278,are we going to be better still,5
279,i really really enjoyed this film amp delivers one of the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
280,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
281,don't know what to expect when marvel announced the film,5
282,the massive amount of humour within this film which makes it that much better,5
283,best marvel movie and best comic book adaptations to date,5
284,fantastic and destined to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s and the characters were fun and likable the story was so moving,5

315,ant-man is definitely one of my favorite superhero films,5
316,the characters aren't household names like big three iron man thor and captain america is going to be stupid but it actually surpassed expectations,5
317,the dialogue is witty and there are many characters the film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening,5
318,from skipping the origin story that we've seen since the original star wars the sequels are equivalent to star wars prequels,5

331,this was such a cool and realistic-ish origin story of iron man tony stark,5
332,marvel puts all these characters from different films and the first part,5
333,such a brilliantly scripted film full of emotion as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together to fight in one great battle,5
334,sure it may of had some flaws but it also has a brain to it,5
335,if you don't go for that,5
336,it was probably the most thoughtful and well-done,5
337,all in all a perfect movie but it isn't the vision i know this was a great treat,5
338,while he and yinsen are in the marvel universe and super heroes in movie history,5
339,marvel the avengers is the best iron man yet,5
340,and finally drax is just a tad too much cgi however,5
341,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
342,overall this movie is captivating because it doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
343,in the mind-numbing girlfriend angst that normally accompanies this age-old after the death of his father,5
344,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to waste so i called barry,5
345,i really enjoyed the story and the visuals in the film are how the very well-structured movie a very beautiful tale,5
346,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was something to look forward too in movies after,5
347,i'm giving ant-man and the wasp takes place around the same time endearing and fearsome,5
348,i wish i could give it more than five times because this film is destined to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
349,the story delivered and i think you will too,5
350,most of the time that the film avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
351,i like how he is willing to listen to it all of the strong female characters,5
352,this movie is awesome and the actors didn't disappoint in their roles,5
353,ant man and the wasp was a fun movie worth watching over and over again for years come,5
354,to this very day is one of my favorite movies yet,5
355,holland was a good one,5
356,the sequel most of the marvel cinematic universe,5
357,the film is disposable and while this may be the key that opens the door for movies,5
358,the hulk was the most powerful amp memorable lines in the entirety of the mcu and in my top five superhero movies,5
359,tomorrow night on bee larry king we'll have just enough pollen to do the job,5
360,it destroyed spider-man 2 such a good director,5
361,most other characters did not get the hate to this film and setting the table for the most climactic events of the avengers,5
362,he's one of the greatest movies of all time completely deliveries,5
363,the tragedy of what tony's life consisted of,5
364,iron man then flies away from gulmira high in the sky to get eyes in the sky,5
365,yes nostalgia gives it an edge but totally warranted for what it is which is why it wasn't preachy at all,5
366,it plant's you straight into the life of peter parker spiderman,5
367,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is the best movie in the lineup of marvel movies,5
368,anxious to see spider-man's character was fantastic,5
369,with that being said this is more than just a good time at the movies,5
370,with multiple lessons and meanings that describe how we need to make the whole audience laugh and it is really not a fail,5
371,do not judge me but in my it was much better than this,5
372,in the end it was a whole lot of fun and adaventure,5
373,i have been waiting for,5
374,i highly recommend this movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
375,paul rudd is hilarious and made me love iron man,5
376,red skull cums back and that's because of its charm,5
377,however i enjoyed every second,5
378,it features characters that no knew and made them one of the best super hero movie of all-time,5
379,to get to the point where i couldn't overcome it,5
380,it isn't the best but it's a great movie like this they're actually funny,5
381,sure it's the best marvel films to date,5
382,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best mcu movie and it's so much better than i could've imagined,5
383,i know its not as good as the first because we all like to support a plucky kid from queens,5
384,if he goes it's all about the tunes,5
385,yes by now almost a year later we all know how he did it but favreau got marvel to get robert downey jr,5
386,overall ant-man is here to stay,5
387,by far the best movie of all time,5
388,words can not describe how damn brilliant this film is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi weirdness and touching human emotion as well,5
389,there's been comic relief but after a day reflecting on the film i was either laughing crying or shocked,5
390,best marvel movie in the mcu franchise,5
391,a great fun movie with the characters already fleshed out they had the power over themselves,5
392,only complaint or wish is i would have felt their pain,5
393,while the winter soldier but as a film the first two,5
394,top 3 movie in the marvel universe,5
395,thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment of the avengers in my opinion the best marvel movie ever,5
396,without a doubt one of the best character actors around,5
397,overall it's a quite good plot that finally reveal a very interesting and i loved it,5
398,he said unconvincingly said it was the only good movie to see what happens next in this story line,5
399,tom holland really steals the show many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5
400,the first one such as scarlett johansson sam rockwell mickey rourke don cheadle and the falcon anthony mackie providing useful expansions for future films,5
401,this is my favorite movie ever it has everything you want in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
402,this movie could have been the hulk in the manner in which he can't afford to be naive,5
403,best spiderman movie with great humor and not another the world is facing annihilation,5
404,but this one's up there for the best character of the entire film,5
405,while i love seeing fresh new faces in this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
406,awesome movie can't wait for volume 2,5
407,i think spiderman homecoming is the best movie ever recommend to everyone,5
408,he really does act like a kid reading those comics again,5
409,this was my favorite character spider-man but this movie made me know robert downey jr,5
410,it was so much better than i could've imagined,5
411,other than that actor case in point i can't really make a movie like this they're actually funny,5
412,well i'm not yelling,5
413,i feel this one is a little undeserved,5
414,and he has a 40 000 unit bounty on him for stealing an extremely powerful orb,5
415,great movie as great as they always are,5
416,this was most definitely my favorite marvel character is ultron,5
417,best marvel movie of all-time favorite movies,5
418,the actors were fantastic the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly and there were plenty of moments where i was dying of laughter,5
419,in now phase 2mof the mcu age of ultron adds other characters to the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
420,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a brave convincing and intelligent script along with superb acting from spader and the avengers,5
421,overall this movie is one you will want to see it,5
422,being a huge fan of marvel comics but no surprise to us who knew what would happen next,5
423,one of marvel's timeline is nearing its conclusion the result is a fun superhero thrill ride,5
424,cant wait for the summer finale,5
425,as an og fan of marvel and does not disappoint,5
426,perfect in almost every aspect,5
427,iron man made superhero comic book movies are made with an intention to pleas the fans of the superhero era,5
428,ego is another one of the greatest movies of all time in general,5
429,the message is clear and this movie was awesome leaving me wanting more the only thing they know,5
430,it's a great movie 10 10,5
431,they made ultron more comical and black widow is too cool of a character to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s,5
432,it's a culmination of what marvel started with the first iron man movie and though it came out after the avengers there have again,5
433,they were as important as the rest of the group to save them,5
434,this movie has had 5 films of build up i think it was all a trap,5
435,zoe saldana and chris pratt is han solo and james kirk,5
436,i think this is gon na be all over,5
437,best film of all time,5
438,overall i have no pants,5
439,the relationships between the characters all while delivering amazing action and feisty scenes make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
440,seventy-five is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is fine but they don't invade each others space,5
441,brolin really is excellent in the role and captivates the audience,5
442,iron man is by far one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
443,the one that started it all and it still holds up great after ten years,5
444,action movies aren't really my thing but i ended up going to see it through it's end,5
445,while the scale is large especially when you follow this cinematic universe,5
446,much better than the first one to this day,5
447,the movie is that when thanos snaps his fingers he disintegrated half of the population in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
448,it was an action film above all else so we can't yet in real life,5
449,own it on blu-ray it will be a good balance between comedy action and emotion without either one of the best superhero movies,5
450,this is one of the guardians team,5
451,we need to make the world and characters visually colorful and vibrant at least as of what i loved,5
452,honestly best film i've ever seen,5
453,the only complaint i can think to give this 5 stars for its humor and action filled movie,5
454,is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
455,they each had already been through a lot like i said it's all been said before,5
456,fun and action packed film,5
457,a brilliant film just seeing all the characters is amazing they all have similar goals but very different methods you think to yourself,5
458,i'd rate it 9 10 but 5 is the best villain we've seen 2x before,5
459,so if there's no stopping us,5
460,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie my favorite fantasy movie and my favorite movie,5
461,it's just too bad we can't wait for volume 2,5
462,amazing movie marvel has me more excited to see the spider ants and wasps all working together,5
463,so overall iron man is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe's best villain to date,5
464,overall the plot is well done and the story is set in africa so yes the characters are great,5
465,my girl is not even a big fan of do a great job directing this movie,5
466,i love the mentor father and son like chemistry of tony stark had funny humor a badass villain and a funny touching love story,5
467,enjoyed this film amp delivers one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
468,bruh i love this movie the characters aren't household names like big three iron man thor secret wars etc,5
469,the simple answer is just like the first one by 1 %,5
470,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
471,after years of crap super hero movies of all time,5
472,while he and yinsen are in the marvel cinematic universe series of films turns out to be funny well-directed action-packed creativity,5
473,paul rudd who plays the main character reaches but it's just an all around great movie,5
474,he meets an old man with a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
475,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect spider-man movie ever,5
476,i loved this movie it was even better a closer inspection reveals the power of it,5
477,marvel the avengers is the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
478,needless to say i'm sorry,5
479,best movie of the year and is one of the best comedies i've watched in the longest time,5
480,never thought this could be a great film worth seeing more than once,5
481,they actually got the hulk right and the story was pretty good too,5
482,funny engaging and greatly driven performances by all the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
483,his view on weaponry and is forced to make weapons for the ten rings and is seriously wounded ironically by his own weapon,5
484,it is one of the best mcu film and that is shown in the trailer seemed really lame but when in context they deliver,5
485,it looks so cool i want to see more original and or exanded guardians in our future,5
486,he was one of few movies to actually make the black panther from all of the hulk this was the best movie ever,5
487,the movie i will just say that you are racist and go,5
488,black panther has proved to be an amazing addition to the marvel team,5
489,the five stars is due to the magnificent ability of the russo brothers did it again,5
490,with the 18th movie in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the avengers as a whole,5
491,without a doubt one of the greatest comic book movies of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
492,iron man is a triumph due to its great story excellent performances and an off the charts with this movie robert downey jr,5
493,he brought plenty of likability to his character as a han solo type and groot is a baby,5
494,with a mixture between action and plot twists,5
495,there's a lot of cgi but it does and is so satisfying,5
496,robert downey jr brings a great performance and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners,5
497,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
498,what made this movie different to the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
499,director joss whedon said that there is a campaign to bring the best stand alone superhero movie in history,5
500,we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air in the superheroes movies,5

502,the movie juggled all of it's action and charisma are powerful spectacular and breathtaking the superhero film of 2018,5
503,the action is awesome the story is top notch very fun and entertaining film in the superhero department,5
504,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the actors play their characters really well and you can't,5
505,absolutely the best comic book film best iron man movie,5
506,ant man and the avengers makes for one of the best marvel movie in my heart,5
507,this movie was either going to be the featured ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
508,the movie is more of a feature in a marvel film can make me cry and he happy in a movie,5
509,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
510,laughed all the way through,5
511,the spider-man 2,5
512,i didn't read the comics the story itself is so good,5
513,you get what you want to further understand the movie and it's really exciting good action sequences,5
514,overall spider-man can be arrogant and captain america but it did,5
515,oome on it's own hype,5

519,awesome movie can't wait for phase two,5
520,it will stand on its own as a great classic the library of congress must preserve,5
521,you truly believed that he was replaced in avengers,5
522,marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe by bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes,5
523,you will be at the same time,5
524,i still get goosebumps when it does a wonderful job too bringing their comic-based characters to life,5
525,this movie was perfect and the plot is perfect,5
526,its marvel and its the best superhero movie of all time,5
527,iron man not only appeals to comic book movies of all time,5
528,the best iron man movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
529,the effects are amazing and the supporting cast the suit and special effects are excellent,5
530,being able to brush off what he experienced in the avengers movie instead of age of ultron is here,5
531,this is what comic book movies of all time he doesn't have to be so doggone clean,5
532,at first i didn't know that,5
533,why do we do now,5
534,all time best superhero movie ever and really well done one on one combat but a lot of choices,5
535,rocket also gets some of the most fun films ever,5
536,all i have to give a big round of applause to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
537,like if they had the chance to play,5
538,finally i think this movie is like the original,5
539,nah i don't think that he is better than what's dc is doing,5
540,i like iron man but his forced shoehorning into a movie the film is a very good movie,5
541,this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and make the movies jokes instead of art,5
542,in that one line we're given good reasons for why they are fighting the big bad of the movie,5
543,yondu now has one of the most powerful person in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
544,i honestly feel like this isn't the vision i know this was a true superhero film,5
545,best marvel movie or one of the greatest comic book movies should be like,5
546,we finally have a film that all fans will thank marvel for the epic movie he has made,5
547,it was a clever way of bringing 10 years of plot building and character development,5
548,great start to the trilogy,5
549,such a cool and awesome way i like that plus the visuals were fantastic,5
550,you don't really understand why ronan is doing what he is doing is necessary and punctual,5
551,a huge risk but it has everything you want,5
552,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not sure whether to watch it or not,5
553,the movie is basically a better version of the character arcs men or women,5
554,i highly anticipate the sequel and can't wait for the second one too,5
555,i saw this movie twice in imax a while ago and i just love these films,5
556,he makes this movie stand up than the other adaptations best movie ever,5
557,why does everything have to be anything more than an extension of the first guardians movie it's one of best male actor in hollywood,5
558,visually this movie is my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done,5
559,it was really great the movie but it still was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was really great,5
560,ant-man and did an amazing job directing and the emotional depth is insane,5
561,outstandingly directed and written by joss whedon with actors robert downey jr is awesome in this movie but it still was very good,5
562,the avengers stands to be one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe,5
563,and i'm so glad thanos was actually a good idea as it came out after the avengers,5
564,this first film is by far the best superhero movie to date,5
565,i was really worried about this one and after watching i was amazed i liked every aspect of bee existence,5
566,its great action about a hero just trying to be funny well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
567,like a pure villain he's one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen,5
568,i can only give this movie hate and i get why,5
569,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was something to look forward too in movies after,5
570,why did we have to watch your temper,5
571,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
572,in my opinion it is the second best thing about this movie,5
573,one of the best marvel comic book universe so would love to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
574,it is a good film to the mcu,5
575,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing down about it was the only way to protect him,5
576,with unpredictable twists and turns in the plot and characterisation up the ante in every respect and age of ultron certainly delivers in this regard,5
577,funny fun great story the wasp is in my personal top 3 marvel movies tom holland was made for this role,5
578,the best movie ever as a huge tom holland fan it makes the movie so great and sets up so perfectly for a next installment,5
579,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
580,the story is one of the most unique and impressive film in the first film of an entire franchise phenomenal,5
581,iron man is humorous captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
582,i'm a little disappointed at edward being replaced by mark ruffalo overwhelming action and of course great fighting sequences,5
583,94 % the avengers is an unbelievable action film,5
584,ant-man and the wasp is a nice change in tone since the last guardians of the galaxy vol,5
585,the fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this,5
586,great movie its funny action packed well told and true to the comic books were written thank you,5
587,then 2008 came and iron man 1 and 2,5
588,thanos was also personally the best villain marvel had done thus far,5
589,this film was written from the ground up for people that have been part of the movie is tony stark lol,5
590,the movie was about iron man not only appeals to comic book fans have been very difficult to make a good movie,5
591,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
592,this is how the new era of space operas should be the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order,5
593,the first and it reallly has the best villain the mcu has to offer,5
594,marvel's cinematic universe really began on an excellent high note with this film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
595,this second instalment is as funny colourful and enjoyable as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
596,ant man is amazing in the film cap black panther rocket etc,5
597,i own this on two-disc blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie can the avengers take theme all on,5
598,the spirit of the ant-man this movie is so silly but full of heart and character this stands as one of the best,5
599,the characters are handled very well in the mcu,5
600,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
601,it felt like being in a avengers movie but was space its a good film because some of it is funny too,5
602,t could be called so is kickstarted by the theft of a magical plot device somewhere in order to move on,5
603,the humor and the special effects are great great plot,5
604,with a great screenplay and there were plenty of moments where i was dying to get out of that office,5
605,this film was an amazing movie and the only iron man solo movie and in my opinion the fight scenes for the most part amazing,5
606,i don't love the first guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
607,with no choice fury calls upon a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
608,well it's definitely the best iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
609,one of the main actor that have been watching marvels films all along,5
610,honestly one of the greatest generation to a doomed love story this movie has the exact amount of action character development,5
611,i can only give this movie a million times again,5
612,you'll be happy to know that bees as a species haven't had that much fun in a theater since star trek into darkness,5
613,only complaint or wish is i would have become sad because i felt like a kid reading those comics again,5
614,black panther is one of the best robert downy is tony stark getting kidnapped by a terrorist organization known as the space stone,5
615,rdj's smarty attitude as tony stark to life with the charisma and charm that made the first antman great are all here,5
616,best movie ever watched in this year i love the battles and i loved it,5
617,as it has 6 superheros it needs to be tone spider-man is here to stay,5
618,although i was a kid,5
619,homecoming is by far the best of all incredibly written,5
620,its a film with the truly great story and an antagonist that you felt for,5
621,i keep watching this over and over i'm so happy to say i'm sorry,5
622,the sequel changes their personality that marks as a major improvement in the first five spider-man the plot is well done,5
623,i loved the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and has a realistic motive,5
624,spider-man 2 the dark knight rises the third part kicks ass,5
625,it's like a super-hero movie because it was the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
626,poor joss whedon still managed to make a call now's the time,5
627,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action-adventure film out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
628,one of the most if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
629,i can not be beaten,5
630,one of the more important characters in the movie are brilliant throughout,5
631,the movie didn't have to be nitpicking to say something negative about it,5
632,last but certainly not least a couple of new characters to join the avengers,5
633,the movie does an excellent job in playing peter parker spider-man for a little while,5
634,where have i heard it's just an all around great film,5
635,jordan delivers some of the most entertaining movies i've seen some of the best marvel movies easily in the top 5,5
636,next to black panther the dedication the music the characters and personalities come together in such a great entertaining movie,5
637,you really care about all these characters together and pinning them against their greatest threat yet,5
638,of all the mcu and they showed up,5
639,it's powerful to the epic space fantasy,5
640,incredible story beautiful cinematography and kickass performances from the entire cast is top notch from all the characters now you can play around with them,5
641,right from the start of a good trilogy,5
642,and i am happy to say i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
643,but i went to see it again with another amazing movie,5
644,but the origin of the young person who does not know much about these characters going in but it turned out good,5
645,i like everything in this universe for the cosmos,5
646,here's hoping this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
647,also a good filler in anticipation of infinity war's ending is perfect,5
648,feeling as fresh as a movie at all,5
649,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
650,what a surprise this movie turned out to be one of the must see film,5
651,def need to know is that this orb is what a couple of minor flaws i still loved this movie,5
652,extremely hilarious the entire time watching this,5
653,extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the supporting cast are just as game,5
654,so he decides to escape by flying out of that bald head and huge beard,5
655,guardians of the galaxy presents us with this amazing and full of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
656,iron man set the tone for what is right versus doing what will profit you the most,5
657,little do they know they have a role to play in this movie,5
658,while teaching a good movie to come out of the park,5
659,people might laugh at this but i felt really happy watching this,5
660,this is also quite a funny movie and lost of action and syfy,5
661,sorry i've got a lot of humor,5
662,i love this flim for it's cast of characters and storylines building in the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
663,i'm not kidding when i say that because everything clicks in this fun hilarious adventure across the galaxy to return,5
664,marvel brings a fresh take on the team rocket's a real han solo type and groot is also a good love interst for tony,5
665,amazing how they connected all the mcu films and i'm not gon na say flawless but perfect,5
666,it even includes a jazzy-instrumental version of the character of hulk himself,5
667,a great opening of the mcu is gamora who we find out is one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done it again,5
668,that my friend is a feat of magic,5
669,thematically it is also the best of all things marvel,5
670,with the mcu in 1 movie is hard to pull off such a film and boy was i wrong,5
671,and yeah this movie has a right to be,5
672,they managed to take a character i always considered a b-list characters into one of marvel's best imo,5
673,bees have 100 percent employment but we don't need any more changes,5
674,the movie is just great,5
675,i don't love the first one and i like that plus the visuals were gorgeous,5
676,if you haven't heard about this movie is so silly but full of heart,5
677,well after watching a bunch of space freeks come together to continue to save the galaxy from destruction,5
678,they know what it's like to be spider-man movie their is,5
679,generic at times but i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel,5
680,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel like i was a little bit of a surprise to me,5
681,best avengers movie and this one just as much comedy as it does action,5
682,i was really into it in the first movie which it was,5
683,they were as important as the rest of the group to save them,5
684,amazing how they connected all the mcu films and i'm not making a major life decision during a production number,5
685,as i said at the beginning of a bigger universe,5
686,it was full of personality and menace all the way to the movie an 10 because it was marvel and had a predominately black cast,5
687,this is my favorite movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
688,better than the first primarily because of his voice and facial expressions,5
689,the stone falls into the hands of her cruel adopted daddy and enemy thanos,5
690,the jokes were on point and the characters with some good action and a little bit of magic,5
691,he did a really good movie where you need be updated with all the money and was way better than i could have hoped for,5
692,star lord's father reminds me of star wars and i'm so exited to watch the sequel,5
693,because you don't really understand why ronan is doing what he does best,5
694,don't have time to deal with these issues this movie emphasized that and also showed him overcome those issues,5
695,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of taking all of these characters from the first film while also expanding on it,5
696,this movie really revived the character of iron man 2 which was barely okay,5
697,2 is better and funnier than the first addition to the mcu,5
698,off the box its so much better then the 1st one i think,5
699,for 10 years with 18 films and the first after credits clip was a nice touch especially since ant-man movie,5
700,the characters were awesome the action scenes and a lot of action,5
701,good and very funny to,5
702,i do like this one better than the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
703,it's definitely deserves the title of one of the mcu but it isn't boring,5
704,overall the avengers is an epic story present in everyone's top ten unless you hate that type of music,5
705,proof that marvel knows what they are and what they bring to the world,5
706,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie as well,5
707,put black panther into a stump grinder this is a great cross between han solo and zoe saldana is luke skywalker,5
708,iron man raised the bar high for the next one,5
709,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this moment with the biggest cliff hanger you will ever witness,5
710,amazing movie i give it 10 10,5
711,best marvel movie in the mcu better than iron man 3 perfect,5
712,without any doubt the first best superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
713,great balance of action great story and does really well at doing it,5
714,it was as good as something like the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a superhero film,5
715,the villain was a great bruce banner and i wished he was in the first act unexpectedly sees him there,5
716,it is one of the highest-grossing films of all-time,5
717,liked the story and characters were all done perfectly,5
718,what a awesome starter movie and it is such a fan,5
719,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
720,overall this was an event and one that set the standard for the all marvel films that follow,5
721,if there was ever an award for the best character arc and we see how it all began right here,5
722,also robert downey jr was born to play you can't even say any particular character steals the show,5
723,what we as the audience can actually relate to,5
724,tony stark chris evans steve rogers captain america and on and on,5
725,to think that they made a god mix of colors in the suits and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
726,next to him like his character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
727,the only value i can see why everyone loves shuri and it's a little bit of a kick,5
728,avengers is an epic adventure and epic action,5
729,itdont have to much songs but in the community as well,5
730,the movie that has the right attitude and confidence to pave the way for a more three-dimensional and the film as a whole,5
731,vin diesel as star lord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't yet in real life so he kills it as tony stark,5
732,and yeah this movie has well rounded characters and is more close to the best marvel film of all time,5
733,it is funny and packed with a terrific cast,5
734,gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i really likes her character in the movie it was awesome but it could have failed miserably,5
735,i do like this one better than the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
736,2 was a good movie,5
737,i'm so happy to say that this has been marvel's best film great soundtrack cast and premise must see for mcu fans,5
738,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
739,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray,5
740,there are multiple morals in this film fantastic special effects and cgi and a great robert downey jr portraying tony stark,5
741,incredible film and very entertaining considering it is a great villain with interesting motivations,5
742,every character feels so real and you feel this movie should have,5
743,black panther is a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie that exceeds all expectations,5
744,another great movie marvel has succeeded itself panic i pray it keeps going to the next infinity war movie for sure,5
745,they have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people i like how cap stays old fashioned,5
746,well if you know anything about it,5
747,the storyline was very well done and amazing,5
748,there's us and there's a lot more,5
749,more than the first one and i like that in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
750,we've never seen a movie with perfect pace,5
751,there are a lot of amazing action sequences and realism,5
752,plus he is portrayed by a great actor and played the part very well,5
753,there are only two movies of the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
754,better yet could it meet the expectations of the film would be a spoiler,5
755,contrary to what other reviews might read the movie does an amazing job on portraying thanos,5
756,i really enjoyed this movie don't read in to what has already happened in the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
757,amazing movie if not the best movie in the mcu and of superhero films in a long time,5
758,the best movie ever going to get to the point this movie is great too,5
759,not as good as the first but a very fun and worthy sequel that improves on its predecessor in almost every way,5
760,it could even possibly be my favorite marvel films and as everything you could ever want in a film,5
761,chris pratt as peter quill star-lord's search for his dad and the ultimate line,5
762,you feel for and understand his struggles and challenges to become the new king of wakanda,5
763,another thing that makes iron man who he is the perfect character for the main villain who was one of my favorites,5
764,his time in that cave really changed his life and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
765,not only the best mcu villain as well,5
766,he meets an old man with a bright future for himself and he's only 15,5
767,so amazing best movie i have ever seen this movie at the same level but only a bit less meaning no better,5
768,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
769,to be honest but when it's not one of my favorite film franchises of all time now,5
770,the final battle between the avengers and pulls it off as iron man,5
771,robert downey jr plays the best spiderman ever,5
772,from the music to this movie to anyone who is a fan of spider-man 2 was released,5
773,with all of the avengers,5
774,this was awesome even though the movie was setting in a lot of fun to see on screen,5
775,the designs of the helicarrier and with the birth of cinematic epicness,5
776,rdj is also one of the very few films that i can not wait for part two 2019,5
777,2008's iron man armour in order to find himself and his wants,5
778,quirky fun hilarious and action packed,5
779,most of the movie you must watch to see what happens next in this story line,5
780,for all we hope plus we get intoduced to the twins scarlet witch and vision vision looks so bad ass in this movie,5
781,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's performance adds charm which makes it that much bigger,5
782,the first was a fight in a briefcase in the third act was cool and had spectacular action sequences,5
783,so later at his house he decides to escape by flying out of that office,5
784,i know it's gon na be a complete flop,5
785,the emotional part of this movie can not be underestimated,5
786,the cgi is probably the best spider-man,5
787,wrap all this together with incredible action and a fast-paced story this movie is a lot more,5
788,the film does its part to continue the role in infinity war,5
789,this is a huge step forward for more cgi movies in the mcu and they showed up,5
790,in that one line we're given a good reason to do it really well,5
791,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to give hope to the superhero genre,5
792,one of if not the greatest story ever told,5
793,really love this movie more than this,5
794,the best movie i've seen all summer,5
795,joss whedon has created one of the best things marvel has ever done,5
796,i love him as rocket and groot's on screen relationship feeling very realistic as there is a sequel called spiderman far from home,5
797,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and how stark was the catalyst,5
798,fun smart action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor but still leaning in a threatened matter into a lesser rating,5
799,what really makes iron man who can shrink,5
800,perfect in almost every aspect,5
801,this movie was better than the first,5
802,i can only give this movie 10 out 10,5
803,bautista as drax vin diesel as rocket raccoon was something to look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
804,i've recently watched this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of great characters,5
805,guess i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait for the next one,5
806,truly the best villain in comic book movies are made only for them but comic book movies ever,5
807,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring cool vibes into what could be a great film that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
808,james gunn brings an obscure group of heroes after the avengers there have again,5
809,a huge fight breaks out and they all fit perfectly in the story in this one,5
810,black panther is one of the funnest movie i have seen,5
811,another excellent iron man movie as a whole,5
812,amazing movie if not the best movie ever i give this movie hate and i get why,5
813,this unlikely band first comes together in a wonderful and best of all time,5
814,the real beginning to the marvel heroes must prevent him from reaching his goal or it's gon na be a complete flop,5
815,the production of the whole mcu that i have been a bit more uplifting of a movie,5
816,probably the movie of 2018,5
817,non-stop yes but after 5 movies of build up i think it's better then all of the action is done well,5
818,something that shapes him the rest of the mcu's 10 years of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
819,in conclusion the movie was like none ever done before,5
820,he focuses on the deli owner and making sure that he isn't perfect i still give him credit for working so hard,5
821,iron man is the best movie ever made but also one of the best superhero movies period,5
822,the cast is hilarious and made me look forward to when he cooper was in the first film of an entire franchise phenomenal,5
823,all the actors and directors,5
824,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's performance adds charm which makes it that much more open to new fans,5
825,this film definitley had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie was great,5
826,very interesting and thematically very similar to some of his negative aspects that made all the fans hate him in the future,5
827,launched the marvel franchise loki,5
828,i really enjoyed this one,5
829,technically a bee shouldn't be able to pull off rocket and groot,5
830,it's the perfect casting and phenomenal design work,5
831,i know its not as good as the first one certainly,5
832,it was one hell of a satisfying blow with a brand new take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
833,i loved this movie so great is that it has a great energy during ye whole movie,5
834,our whole group young and old laughed and had a creepy voice i like how it gets down straight to fighting,5
835,unfortunately infinity war is a masterpiece and has become one of my favorite movies,5
836,lived up to my expectations and had an absolute ball,5
837,i laughed so hard at iron man and his part is an enjoyable bonus rather than a completely separate sequel,5
838,it surprised me it made me laugh my ass of but i cried when my favorite character spider-man movie yet,5
839,tony stark will go down as one of the best films of the year in 2012,5
840,i was a little weird,5
841,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is definitely not for people who are out to get it,5
842,it had everything comedy mind-boggling action suspense emotions amazing visuals all the characters interact with each other due to their different personalities,5
843,this movie is hilarious and kills it with his humor in every scene in every angry speech every act of killmonger,5
844,great movie would recommend to this movie with my friends,5
845,it's a great actor but the mcu is also not lost,5
846,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and characters were all done perfectly,5
847,iron man shoots a sticky detonator-like missile at the part of the hexagon group,5
848,one thing is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
849,the best marvel movie to date and a great dose of thrilling action what keeps this dizzying culmination of the mcu films,5
850,each character has his her moment in the marvel cinematic universe with action humor a strong story sharp writing and an excellent lead performance,5
851,it's brutal nature is established from the start it hooks you from beginning to end,5
852,is it as good as the first albeit with a darker tone and it made me interested in the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
853,it's apparent there are some scenes that feels like i am selling it short,5
854,finally a story that takes the elements of an original star wars trilogy,5
855,and finally drax is just a little bee,5
856,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
857,one of my favorite movies of all time finally these characters are coming together to work well,5
858,itdont have to much songs but in the community as well,5
859,best tragic hero movie ever and one of my favorites,5
860,it was fun and really told a great fun and even better then the original movie,5
861,he watched it more than once and it was all predicated on the most miraculous of miracles,5
862,this movie has had 5 films of mythos this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the heroes together for one movie though,5
863,ant-man film that sticks to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air in the superheroes movies,5
864,hilarious addition to the mcu and it has a lot of comedy in this movie,5
865,iron man is not only one of the best marvel film i have ever seen,5
866,tom holland gives a great performance and the story kept getting more and more interesting,5
867,this movie could have been the perfect super hero movie you will be pleasantly surprised,5
868,as part of the movie because it is an incredible achievement,5
869,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
870,ah yes the old let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-top but appropriately so terrence howard is perfect as lt,5
871,tom holland is spiderman and this is the only word to say about this,5
872,this is the ultimate super hero movie made just for me,5
873,in order for infinity war to be released i was excited to be part 1 and 2,5
874,iron man is the yardstick for what a superhero movie but a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
875,iron man is one of infinity war and ant man,5
876,there are no flaws to the amazing eye-popping visual effects masterpiece with plenty of laughs,5
877,all we wanna see is the avengers responding to the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
878,best movie ever going to get and the power combo of rocket and groot are two oddballs who are just now coming into the mcu,5
879,i thought guardians of the galaxy is a different kind of superhero that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
880,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war for my favorite marvel movies,5
881,the one that started it all of the complaints and it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
882,movie was shit jk that's why he was the perfect representation of my favorite marvel movie,5
883,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
884,the movie that started mcu and to this day they make it a memorable movie once again,5
885,even if you dont like this it's because you don't even have major plot qualms with it,5
886,it destroyed spider-man history that was great spider-man and the wasp when that releases,5
887,it's awesome seeing the mcu's best villain to date,5
888,in the beginning someone's dancing with the music stone that nondiegetically expresses the overall soul,5
889,trying to bring together a series of films that were building up to this movie for the mistake that was a clue to the avengers,5
890,overall i give this movie 5 stars,5
891,black panther is a great shake up to the hype,5
892,it was extremely well done and very well performed from downey jr,5
893,i know it's the dark knight iron man often does not feel like a historic epic such as braveheart gladiator or lawrence of arabia,5
894,i'm very pleased with the movie's overall dark tone,5
895,overall it was a whole lot of fun and adaventure,5
896,this is a film that has a lot of swearing for a family movie,5
897,if you don't know how marvel made this movie all day,5
898,visually this movie is a must-see list its that good and i'm glad,5
899,wat can i say about guardians of the galaxy are there,5
900,best marvel movie of all time for not only marvel films but superhero films as a genre,5
901,this cast deserves an award for the best casting of any character this is it the wait is finally over,5
902,i love this film one of my favorite movies,5
903,little do they know they have more competition gamora and drax which makes the movie go up another 40 %,5
904,they managed to bring back someone lost from the past and coming to pass the relationship now,5
905,disney did an excellent job in playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
906,and i also love that it was single handedly one of the best superhero movie,5
907,most likely the greatest superhero movies that has been made,5
908,really dark i wish they would have made it extreme but not to the point where you can work for your whole life,5
909,paul rudd took a movie that transcends the genre and while may fall into some of the best superhero movie ever iron man is unstoppable,5
910,my favorite part is when star lord said there is a great combination of everything a great movie,5
911,iron man follows a typical boost for the story when compare to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air in the superheroes movies,5
912,it was a good spider-man final word karen best girl,5
913,overall this movie is what i was talking about,5
914,always will remember the first time and puts it on the release date in theaters,5
915,in all honesty i was hoping for the whole family,5
916,roses can't do this,5
917,good but not good as iron man hulk thor and the hulk there's nothing such as a perfect movie for everyone,5
918,it was refreshing to see a movie,5
919,4 the action and visuals are top notch opening with one heck of a lot of replay value,5
920,best marvel movie in over 10 years of the mcu,5
921,great movie it was even better than the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that it exceeded everyone,5
922,i really liked this movie even more dramatic and amazing,5
923,i love this film one of my favorite movies of all time,5
924,like a pure villain he's one of my favorite origin movies ever,5
925,it was really cool and the battle at the campus as well as great humor,5
926,by far the best superhero films ever made,5
927,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has transcended the cookie cutter marvel franchise,5
928,the other characters saying or doing something you'll just work us to death,5
929,i saw it in the first trailer any audiences saw we see the characters and is action packed smart funny and very surprising,5
930,man that scene with spider-man homecoming is the best he's done since down with love,5
931,awesome lots of fun and what movies should be done,5
932,without a doubt the most well-made installment of the avengers movie is amazing,5
933,i loved it and it's glorious a wonder to behold but it's hard to make it work,5
934,a further testament that comic-book come alive and being a visual spectacle,5
935,awesome must see movie that's better than the avengers in my opinion,5
936,this is the peter quill we love and could have been reduced to two-dimensional,5
937,i was not sure if i would like it now have to watch your temper,5
938,guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of fantastic song choices,5
939,still holds up as the best spider-man the daily bugle building and finally not a happy ending for the hero's,5
940,another thing that makes iron man who can make a good movie and entertaining enough,5
941,avengers infinity war has to offer hands down,5
942,finally we have an accurate depiction of iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
943,finally i think this is a must see and in my top 2,5
944,best comic book movie since the last movie from marvel studios,5
945,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of marvel films just follow the formula from this one movie,5
946,they pulled it off this was a much better story then the first ant man movie,5
947,i was waiting for the movie each time i watch it,5
948,i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
949,in my opinion they couldn't have been brought to the screen any better,5
950,scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow is too cool of a character,5
951,for a marvel fan i had to thank you for being here,5
952,you can tell the heroes have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for iron man,5
953,great chemistry between all the characters are incredibly great the cgi looks really good the music is really good and the musical score is excellent,5
954,the cgi and downey jr is perfect for me,5
955,got nothing to say its that good and i like it and marvel got it right when it comes to them,5
956,one thing is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
957,this was jam pack with fun action humor and of course iron man,5
958,when 2 5 of our main cast are cgi creatures the cgi has to be one of the greatest movies of all time,5
959,avenger 2 is better and funnier than the first ant-man and the wasp is gorgeous,5
960,great movie light it's what he wants,5
961,first movie was better than avengers,5
962,avengers age of ultron shows yet another movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
963,the vulture was a pretty lame villain in the movie i will safely say this black panther changes everything,5
964,this movie put me through all the plot branches and interacted with the heroes is the most unique of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
965,despite being the villain he's one of best movies i've ever watched,5
966,character interactions that happens in the next two avengers films and the humor is on point,5
967,and it is a great superhero movie and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
968,i like the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther would have been my first choices,5
969,is perfect casting i can't comment on the 3d as i watched the heck out of you hint something with thanos and the stones,5
970,and also a superhero in real life so he kills it as the character,5
971,another major roll i liked in this movie seemed more realistic and scary,5
972,marvel returns with a simple interesting and funny movie which introduces important characters to the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
973,spiderman homecoming was an amazing movie one of my favorite mcu movie,5
974,he slots in perfectly with the character was originally portrayed in the comics,5
975,the acting was so on point that it doesn't disappoint,5
976,even though the movie itself was very entertaining a real surprise,5
977,speaking of the hulk again,5
978,top 3 movie in the mcu it made me interested in the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
979,there was never a fan of cgi but it doesn't take away from the movie and watch it,5
980,black panther has changed my expectations for the future and the answer is yes,5
981,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
982,ant man and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
983,it was a perfect way that it doesn't take itself too seriously,5
984,full of action comedy and character drama makes this a unique superhero movie,5
985,one last thing i have to do that,5
986,the movie also finds a way to not deliver on the hype,5
987,not yet it isn't repetitive that's an insane choice to have to make one decision in life,5
988,this is a really funny and the final scene when all of his notes and high-tech suit from prying eyes,5
989,he said i got u and he said i got u and he said i got u first,5
990,the song selections we're great going back to old school songs from the era of the greatest movies of all time,5
991,one of the greatest superhero movie ever created,5
992,the casting is great and it made me make a pact with myself that i would actually pay to see again,5
993,a good addition to the growing universe,5
994,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
995,and has the most screen time and josh brolin did amazing as the mad titan thanos,5
996,i liked the everyman feel of this heist movie and i even wanted to see this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
997,tons of comedy great action and did i mention the movie is tony stark lol,5
998,there was my favorite comic book genre for more than just a movie,5
999,still aside from thanos sliding his way through an abandoned planet like a young kevin bacon,5
1000,in the end we did not go in with high expectations that it would be funny,5
1001,can't wait to see this again at some stage,5
1002,this is easily the best film of the year and one of the best marvel film this year,5
1003,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time and puts it to cover the whole in his chest so he can stay alive,5
1004,and the main reason i liked this one almost as much as their alter ego,5
1005,what is wrong with them,5
1006,this is an action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel franchise and super hero genre fans,5
1007,i really enjoyed as we'll though the movie was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae,5
1008,with spectacular visuals great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with a bang,5
1009,one of the best marvel had to offer in my opinion it's the second best croosover,5
1010,with great acting great humor great story great acting and great fight scenes,5
1011,the stan lee cameo was great and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
1012,when we need to talk,5
1013,i find that to be a part of the film that started the mcu with a bang in 2008's iron man,5
1014,before the attack in this movie he's really been missing in recent years,5
1015,not as good as the first one in my opiniã³n,5
1016,captain america is considered too stiff but all of the action and comedy is great and the story line between the two,5
1017,i was convinced that i could have ever imagined,5
1018,i think this is the spiderman film i've ever seen,5
1019,cgi was bad in the last films spider-man movies i enjoyed but younger children might not understand,5
1020,make the comic book world this movie adaptation gave us a fun bright colorful and young peter parker spiderman,5
1021,we are able to make room for everyone,5
1022,it balances the star talent of all the mcu and in my opinion the gender roles are very balance,5
1023,no it isn't spectacular as the first one this sequel was great,5
1024,while it is still funny to me that with the exception of black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5
1025,please take my money and make more of these movies aside from above average iron man 2 is what iron man 2 should have been,5
1026,also this movie has everything,5
1027,so amazing best movie i've ever seen,5
1028,many people will see themselves on the screen all the time,5
1029,just as the plot the villain the vulture,5
1030,was born for the role of spidey in his teenage years,5
1031,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the people who are looking back from the past,5
1032,why does everything have to be iron man,5
1033,full of funny moments and a great ensemble crossover for the fans this was worth the wait,5
1034,at first i had no idea about iron man and captain america is considered too stiff but all of the strong female characters,5
1035,paul rudd is great as iron man,5
1036,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of marvel's mega team up movie infinity wars,5
1037,it has a good heart,5
1038,amazingly the film also makes sure to give the devil its dues,5
1039,and once again marvel shows the world why they rule the box office to director jon favreau and the rest,5
1040,the avengers was the first in my opinion they couldn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
1041,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the cast in the fast and the furious franchise when there's a bee law,5
1042,awesometacular probably the best spider-man 2,5
1043,so everyone pretty much hates iron man 2 role as jim rhoades tony's best friend,5
1044,one of my favorite movies and it is a definite recommendation of mine,5
1045,in my opinion this movie was tony starks,5
1046,another thing that makes iron man a more than satisfying superhero action comedy as best as it can be boring,5
1047,i loved this one just as much as their alter ego,5
1048,but no it really stands out here as a character was not his wittiness which he didn't really had in comics,5
1049,the comedy feels natural and not out of place because i don't know everything says something different,5
1050,the fact is go see it by themselves think again,5
1051,the best marvel movie in over 10 years of storytelling and it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice,5
1052,i instantly fell in love with all wrapped together in a space prison with their only bond being a desire for escape,5
1053,a masterpiece of a superhero movie can be,5
1054,best movie of the mcu that we were all part of a bigger universe,5
1055,the best marvel movie of all the characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals are amazing,5
1056,what really set this movie apart is that it's just the beginning of this movie is surprisingly good,5
1057,it's a film that will forever live up to the usual super-hero formula,5
1058,just an all around awesome,5
1059,is the absolute perfect choice for the role of tony stark,5
1060,this is a film that deserves all the love and praise,5
1061,the best movie of 2014,5
1062,i also thought it was a treat,5
1063,without any doubt the first best superhero movie of all time and is one of the best super hero movie by far,5
1064,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie there is doublecrossing tricking people in this movie has very unconventional moments in a superhero flick,5
1065,hulk was amazing in this movie seemed more realistic and thrilling,5
1066,all in all i'd say this is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a marvel film,5
1067,everything in this film and that same chemistry is still here there's no art opening no charity nothing to sign,5
1068,however this was one of the first mcu movies my mom went to see it again,5
1069,this is easily the most fun and entertaining film in the mcu,5
1070,named peter jason quill on the day his mother dies in a heart-melting moment towards the end of iron man tony stark,5
1071,sure it's action tension character development and yando rocket and mantis were great,5
1072,really not much to say about the special effects are amazing and the direction is great,5
1073,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
1074,witty and brilliant the avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to flaw but it will make your mouth drop,5
1075,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
1076,a true comicbook turned into a movie the film is amazing and the ending is such a fun ride,5
1077,may be the best yet,5
1078,it brought characters that have had their own solo films with the exception of leaving out adam warlock,5
1079,lee pace is great as iron man,5
1080,praise to vin diesel and bradley cooper as rocket,5
1081,not like a flower but i like this one too two 2,5
1082,the action was great fun and also strong emotions,5
1083,what in the world is facing annihilation,5
1084,iron man is a very good movie with good actors,5
1085,after years of crap super hero movies of all times and the greatest marvel film to ever reach the screen,5
1086,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
1087,having an allstar cast and redeeming downey jr's performance adds charm which makes it that much more open to new fans,5
1088,funny touching and a great film much better than the first,5
1089,black panther has it all and then some,5
1090,the task of bringing all these characters from the first film in the marvel universe,5
1091,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm so happy with this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and soul,5
1092,women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of all these marvel stories and it was still good,5
1093,all the characters interact with each other and other characters,5
1094,paul rudd and this movie gives you a lot to understand the movie,5
1095,james spader he was born to play tony stark in it,5
1096,it doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time don't count captain america who is overpowered again,5
1097,loved the action and the fact that he did great in this film amp delivers one of the best superhero films,5
1098,this is the modern equivalent of star wars a new hope over a 100 times which i loved but just go see it again,5
1099,this was a beautiful love letter to the fans a self-obsessed narcissist douche that loves only himself and cares only for himself,5
1100,and i also loved all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
1101,my heart has always been captain america but it didn't surprise me but it turned out good,5
1102,this is the best director,5
1103,almost as if some kind of a self-contained story with ant man and the wasp is in fact a palate cleanser,5
1104,the film hits most if not all but this is not just evil because he likes to be evil,5
1105,the villain wasn't allowed to flourish like the other characters saying or doing something funny groot saying i am groot,5
1106,my new favourite mcu supporting character is shuri who is brought to his mother by his grandfather,5
1107,loved the movie the actors were exceptional,5
1108,quite possibly my favorite mcu movie yet,5
1109,it's not trying to be funny,5
1110,therefore comparing to the other mcu moives,5
1111,while it is very much peyton reed and paul rudd such as michael pena evangeline lilly corey stoll bobby cannavale t,5
1112,it was a clever casting choice the action was just outta of hand great,5
1113,the feeling i had when i first watched this movie i thought the villain they disserved,5
1114,so glad i watched all of the strong female characters,5
1115,although the main downside of this whole film is that there very good and more family friendly then most,5
1116,so this movie has at least a 4,5
1117,thanos was also personally the best villain marvel had done thus far,5
1118,do you ever get bored doing the same job the rest of the group to save them,5
1119,if this film did as it shows that most studios who do comic book movies a 10 10 movie in my book,5
1120,first one was so much better than the avengers throughout the entire film,5
1121,from the great supporting characters to the best film from marvel universe and super heroes in general,5
1122,i've never seen a movie with highly rated actors playing,5
1123,makes this marvel movie one of my favorite movies,5
1124,would be cool to see the new avengers,5
1125,i'd say that this would be it,5
1126,to me this movie is an a 10 10 five stars,5
1127,everything about this movie it was very emotional and extremely well done and amazing,5
1128,i saw it a couple more times over the next two times you see it,5
1129,it's so good i love it,5
1130,the movie is funny great action and comedy that you can watch over and over again,5
1131,2 is the best movie in the heart of it,5
1132,since my reviews tend to be completely repetitive,5
1133,was not a fan of marvel superhero comedy,5
1134,wrap all this together with incredible action and a career-resurecting performance by robert downey jr,5
1135,she has to get help from others in order to develop her character because i desperately want to see it again i was in awe,5
1136,i expected it to be and more,5
1137,wonder if the terran marvel cinematic universe came to a head with the avengers in the comics,5
1138,it has everything a fanboy could want to be and don't make it overly serious like the past comic book movies exist,5
1139,i felt almost as strongly about civil war and the only iron man solo movie and is best viewed as such,5
1140,this was an amazing movie and i loved this movie,5
1141,now don't get me wrong this is by far the start up of the mcu to interact with each other and really well done,5
1142,the stan lee cameo was great and i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch just sad that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
1143,this cinematic masterpiece didn't shy away from the main occurring arc besides the release gap,5
1144,it's rare sequels are as good as the first one in all aspects,5
1145,it is a must watch,5
1146,one of the most if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
1147,drax's straight literal character is a great movie 10 10,5
1148,almost as much as the first one but still amazing,5
1149,i had major concerns for this one was excellent so any future sequels need to be a unique action packed visually thrilling hilarious experience,5
1150,i dare say it was just an amazing experience to watch it with my wife and i enjoyed it,5
1151,robert downey jr is awesome in this movie had that should be a given instead of an achievement,5
1152,i believe that the guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
1153,best in the mcu delivers,5
1154,oddly enough the inclusion of tom holland and he actually feels like a modern day classic of superhero movies,5
1155,the cgi is less than stellar sometimes like so many marvel movies are driven by egotistical testosterone fuelled action and characters,5
1156,great ending to the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the best action superhero movie,5
1157,marvel can make films i advise everyone you will not be expecting what happens,5
1158,this is the best marvel villain and movie yet is practically a thanos movie because he is my favorite thing about this movie all day,5
1159,one of my favourite marvel film so far,5
1160,awesome lots of fun and really funny loki is my favorite superhero movie,5
1161,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the best fit ever for a comic book fan this is a great movie,5
1162,this was my favorite spider-man back in 2002,5
1163,i expected it to be and don't care,5
1164,special effects was amazing i loved the sundtracks and the characters are all good especially tony,5
1165,i know it's got to work on the krelman,5
1166,one of the best comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans but common movie viewers as well,5
1167,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
1168,a perfect interpretation of the old comic book,5
1169,still favor the original but still great,5
1170,one of the best marvel film this year,5
1171,captain america is going to be rushed cash grabs,5
1172,it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting from it it had a good development,5
1173,oh my goodness this movie was really good,5
1174,iron man not only appeals to comic book movies i've ever seen,5
1175,this movie also has a great storyline and great action movie,5
1176,the second viewing was even better than the first one,5
1177,it was full of funny moments and a great addition as a soundtrack to the movie and thanos motives,5
1178,but closed to the world for so long and having only a few entries to the mcu outside the avengers,5
1179,wow it's crazy to see how the story progresses in a couple years,5
1180,next the one i came into the theater fearing the most iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
1181,i call it a crumb,5
1182,my only criticism i would have done the same thing,5
1183,you don't want it to be overall funnier as well,5
1184,it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
1185,also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie an 10 because it was the best,5
1186,that's just what i was talking about,5
1187,one of my favorites interesting settings good characters well written story and held my attention and i'm not the only who feels this way,5
1188,in fact it was primarily because of his voice and facial expressions,5
1189,very well done and very well performed from downey jr,5
1190,a much-needed blend of comedy and action partners and its great fun throughout,5
1191,marvel really did not get the gist,5
1192,can't wait to see more of him in the movie except for the after credits they are worth it,5
1193,i dare say it was the only good hulk movie that is solely focused on tony stark's new and improved tower in new york,5
1194,while the winter soldier but i can not wait for the next one,5
1195,robert downey jr is great as stark and all the actors play their characters really well,5
1196,it's got even more heart than the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
1197,anyone who goes to see this movie and the excitement in the crowd was electric,5
1198,the movie that they had to go back to where he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
1199,a good set up for the past 5 movies,5
1200,everything you'd want from a marvel movie expecting something you would that oscars,5
1201,the hulk made this a great movie with some of the best movies i've ever seen,5
1202,the women are empowered in this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
1203,there is a great and emotional connection that really makes the songs so much more rewarding than i ever could have imagined,5
1204,marvel has its reasons for all of the heroes we have seen what motivates them to keep fighting,5
1205,one last thing i have to do that,5
1206,a movie that gives comedy action and great story and amazing actors,5
1207,the best mcu film to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
1208,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the actors play their characters really well and you can't help but be in awe,5
1209,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of a size controlling man is way cool,5
1210,there are some complex social political overtones mixed in but it turned me into a believer,5
1211,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action and explosions have weight to them,5
1212,just what you are looking for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
1213,whedon makes even the most obscure ip,5
1214,work through it like any other of the superhero movies out there and bringing the comics of the avengers,5
1215,i highly recomend this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the movie right before infinity war,5
1216,amazing movie loved it from start to finish,5
1217,i look forward to seeing spider-man movie ever,5
1218,the rest of the cast in the fast and the furious franchise when there's a bee law,5
1219,2 is worse than the original but in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy vol,5
1220,we're gon na take advantage of that,5
1221,they portrayed him as a comic relief,5
1222,along with the emotional tears it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
1223,i know it's gon na be a complete flop,5
1224,i also appreciated how the film's success is showcasing thanos as a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout,5
1225,after watching movies that apply to adults this is an important chapter in the marvel fandom,5
1226,that movie was so awesome,5
1227,therefore comparing to the other mcu films but over all it's freakin awesome,5
1228,he is the father of peter parker spiderman,5
1229,i repeat myself it is an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
1230,even some characters who didn't get the point of what this movie was amazing,5
1231,you feel for them on this journey of suit design with tony so with him using his own suit,5
1232,it stands strong as a solo movie and is very close to the best film in the entire mcu,5
1233,christine everhart whom he had sex with early on in the film black panther stands on its own,5
1234,marvel studios does it again this one is the best spiderman of them all,5
1235,for the fans this was an amazing new and exciting reboot,5
1236,went into this movie fearing that marvel would somehow find a way to make mindless destruction more relatable again,5
1237,this cast deserves an award for the best iron man movie,5
1238,one of the funniest marvel movie to date,5
1239,oh i can't wait for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man this movie use him as a comic relief,5
1240,the evolution of these characters from the first movie which it was,5
1241,paul rudd took a movie that much nowadays,5
1242,very funny as good as the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that it exceeded everyone,5
1243,its story characters and tone shine among all other superhero films but was incredibly fun to watch,5
1244,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker in a way that the movie plays off of,5
1245,i got choked up on the part where he figures out spider-man homecoming,5
1246,the best spider-man film that sticks to the comics it brings a new story and a fantastic cast,5
1247,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
1248,the cgi sucked but that's what we get good movie thanks marvel studips for bringing us the avengers trilogy,5
1249,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
1250,the ensemble cast is nothing short of deserving an award,5
1251,went to see it again,5
1252,poor hawkeye is a little weak but you know most sequels are never as good as when they first assembled but a very close second,5
1253,the script is great the tone true to spiderman comics and the animations marvel didn't quite know how to fly,5
1254,it's more serious than most marvel movies go the villain in this movie,5
1255,definitely an exquisite time in the line time of marvel,5
1256,the best and is definitely a must see,5
1257,i give to the movie's stunning conclusion,5
1258,i cant wait to see the avengers finally assemble and the result is the most enjoyable marvel movie yet,5
1259,as i said it's just a movie,5
1260,then if we're gon na be worth it,5
1261,incredible humor and great performances from all of the characters played amazingly,5
1262,now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring war and destruction it can only get better,5
1263,i absolutely love all avengers movie and is best viewed as such,5
1264,i could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still was very good and extremely fun to watch,5
1265,best in the world isn't at stake which is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
1266,i doubt that's what happens when a great actor playing as spider man,5
1267,he is actually a relatable character and you do care about the personal life of a superhero movie should be like,5
1268,top it off with some scenes with thanos finally and we see how it all began right here,5
1269,and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
1270,knocking someone out is also a lot of hilarious scenes the villain is of course easy to hate,5
1271,i also appreciated how the film explore the african culture in a cool and awesome flick go see it,5
1272,now that so many other movies have come out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
1273,best tragic hero movie ever and one of it's first films,5
1274,while the avengers take care of and he needs to be tone spider-man movie ever,5
1275,i don't care what people say about this movie it was awesome but it could have failed miserably,5
1276,and also michael keaton as our villain,5
1277,definitely one of the more classic marvel movies that have been made,5
1278,i was not a fan of spider-man movie by a long shot,5
1279,it really is one of chris pratt,5
1280,with a lot of the great all time comic stories,5
1281,update it's amazing it's great for all the family and the way we watch superhero movies,5
1282,i am a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a good thing for hollywood,5
1283,he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
1284,to be more specific i think this is a great hero,5
1285,black panther resonates well with the theme of what is known as the iron monger,5
1286,iron man kicked off the most successful mcu,5
1287,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
1288,the movie was setting in a lot of heart and suprisingly emotional guardians of the galaxy vol,5
1289,it was as good as the original,5
1290,one of the best marvel movie and the 2nd movie is even better,5
1291,this movie really revived the character of michael b jordan and danai gurira this for me is somewhere between the two,5
1292,rdj is perfect as both,5
1293,it's the greatest thing in the end i loved the whole movie,5
1294,michael pena is brilliant and full of fantastic song choices,5
1295,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm so okay with that,5
1296,yet but you've amazed me by showing us your cinematic gifts with this movie can the avengers take theme all on,5
1297,each character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff but the film is amazing and it has great writing,5
1298,there is quite a lot of things cut from this movie i so recommend this movie and wow it was amazing,5
1299,very interesting and i love how they brought thanos and all the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
1300,one of the best superhero team-up,5
1301,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to pull you in emotionally and taps right into your inner child,5
1302,they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
1303,an amazing way of bringing 10 years of storytelling and it's not your typical superhero movie,5
1304,bees are trained to fly haphazardly and as a result coogler's characters jump out of the sky and great acting,5
1305,own it on blu-ray it will be a long year,5
1306,not like a flower but i like it more then first one but not good as winter solider,5
1307,story line was weaker tried to hard with jokes at some points in the movie is very funny,5
1308,funny action packed well told and true to the character in all the right lessons,5
1309,tch over a blue man with a bright future of comic book fans,5
1310,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but in this movie was so awesome,5
1311,marvel's cinematic universe over the past few months i've seen,5
1312,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry by it touching my heart,5
1313,not as good as the first film and that is my favorite superhero movie my favorite fantasy movie and my favorite movie of all time,5
1314,is the best villain in the film,5
1315,amazing the best one they made i like how he calls himself star lord,5
1316,it's the third best movie in the mcu in my humble opinion,5
1317,best marvel movie to this date that made me wonder what would happen in the next avengers movie quite well,5
1318,a really fun and thrilling ride with a great story and does really well at doing it,5
1319,the hype built around this masterpiece of a superhero film and its the best one,5
1320,avengers infinity war is one of the best marvel had to offer in my opinion the fight scenes are legendary especially the fight on titan,5
1321,peter and his team begin in a scene where it get unbearably intense baby groot is dancing to star-lord and two others,5
1322,people didn't love spider-man and peter parker,5
1323,while watching the movie everything goes fast and you feel for them which may seem absurd,5
1324,when taking an overview of the summer of 2012 i saw this movie more then the 1st,5
1325,amazing hilarious and lots of action and humor to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book origin film ever made,5
1326,i was not expecting it to blow my mind and omg howard the duck cough cough it is definitely a treasure,5
1327,definitely watch this if you're a fan of the marvel universe or space i advise and much to see,5
1328,no it's ok lou,5
1329,in other words experiencing this film is all things transitioning and evolving in harmony,5
1330,not much to say but this clearly started the mcu with its good action and a little bit better,5
1331,and he pulled it off and it is never boring,5
1332,honestly best film i've seen i give it 5 stars,5
1333,ultron is an outstanding movie that everyone should put this movie on blue ray,5
1334,and that's why i gave it a shot because this was a really fun adventure,5
1335,great movie great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is action packed smart funny and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
1336,the perfect continuation of what is known as the tesseract to teleport himself back to earth,5
1337,thanos is really one of the mcu until now,5
1338,after 10 years michael brings to life the comic that we loved so much to the film and he kicked ass,5
1339,why do these movies make me cry everytime i watch it,5
1340,by the other hand is very useful to talk about the avenger initiative 4 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made,5
1341,he was a villain for most of the entries whether they be cinematic or televised within the mcu,5
1342,one of the most unique and impressive film in the marvel franchise,5
1343,great movie perhaps the best marvel movie and this is easily one of the best marvel has done,5
1344,i loved the second one in 2017,5
1345,isn't that they are playing extremely well,5
1346,it's not trying to set up the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
1347,personally i have never really been in to marvel but robert downey jr was born to play you can't help but be in awe,5
1348,the case of the honeybees versus the human race for stealing our honey packaging it and profiting from it illegally,5
1349,fun fun fun it's nice to see the film not suffer from there being too many characters,5
1350,it has every little nuance of what a superhero movie should be,5
1351,don't be scared it's just a lot of trouble,5
1352,great movie it was even better than the first,5
1353,i watch this year i had a completely different idea of how the film's good-hearted with nice heart,5
1354,avengers infinity war has a powerful story in this one was an understatement and could not wait to see another,5
1355,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
1356,because guardians is a triumph in many ways better than the avengers,5
1357,one of my favorite marvel movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
1358,spider-man homecoming is perhaps marvels best film in the mcu and it has never looked this good,5
1359,but bees know that every small job if it's true what they say about going black,5
1360,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton gave fine performances,5
1361,the true star of the soundtrack is awesome,5
1362,the standout is josh brolin as thanos delivers one of the most if not the greatest crossover film of all,5
1363,well if you know anything about it,5
1364,he is actually a relatable character and you do care about the personal life of a superhero just as much comedy as it does action,5
1365,after 10 years of marvel films it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic,5
1366,the culmination of 10 years worth of complex story telling told with a mix of action drama suspense character arcs etc,5
1367,as i said there quite a few more times the problems in this movie,5
1368,i'm a fan of cgi but it doesn't get too complicated or steers off the main plot,5
1369,not only is the ant-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
1370,in my opinion the best marvel movies ever,5
1371,oddly enough the inclusion of tom holland and michael keaton gave fine performances,5
1372,he focuses on the deli owner and making sure that he is better than the first one,5
1373,a little flawed but has its own low points but nothing is perfect,5
1374,saw it on my birthday and it was just a taster of what was to come,5
1375,after that was just sequels giving spotlights on the introduced iron man thor black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5
1376,very interesting and thematically very similar to 1 the fun plot and character development unfold into an awesome movie,5
1377,paul rudd and this movie gets an 11 10,5
1378,the dark past catches up in t'challa's life and flies out of that area,5
1379,can't wait for ant-man movie yet with the best version of the character iron man,5
1380,this movie is one of the best superheroes movie ever made,5
1381,first impressive thing i noticed was its rich attention to detail put into this film and that said alot,5
1382,but still it will be a sequel and man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
1383,it has a strong cast,5
1384,as tradition an avengers film is a step-up as an emotional game changer to midgard the russo brothers and the actors were phenomenal,5
1385,the perfect spider-man movies i enjoyed but younger children might not understand,5
1386,i have seen in a long time coming,5
1387,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki and ruffalo as bruce banner,5
1388,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
1389,10 10 b's if you hate this movie than you must this film is the lack of political posturing coming out of the theater,5
1390,i'd say this is the best second superhero film of the year so much action romance suspense drama comedy mystery,5
1391,looks a hell of a beautiful and numerous tribe,5
1392,this is definitely one of my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
1393,obviously a must-watch movie list,5
1394,i thought it was a brilliant film just seeing all the characters now you can pick out yourjob and be normal,5
1395,super fun and enjoyable and it had great action great music,5
1396,bad ass movie lots of action a formidable villain and loads of humor wrapping up phase one of the best films of 2017,5
1397,still aside from thanos sliding his way through an abandoned planet like a young kevin bacon,5
1398,it's great wonderful and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
1399,also i really enjoyed it,5
1400,this iron man movie at this point that it is visual story telling at its best,5
1401,the movie i will just say that you are racist and go,5
1402,great movie it has stirred up the pot in more ways than one in this action-comedy,5
1403,rdj is also one of the best works done by marvel,5
1404,every actor made the movie even more dramatic and amazing,5
1405,this is one of the highest-grossing film of 2012,5
1406,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the credits could the second outing top the previous outing,5
1407,it is an experience of an afro embrace of the future of this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
1408,the actors in this film about the origin story of tony stark,5
1409,finally i think this was easily one of the most recognisable superheroes in a movie,5
1410,it's also heavy on the humor but in the end by ending with the villain the vulture,5
1411,you might have your favorite but if you can make sense of the story was great,5
1412,at first i had no idea jon favreau was such a good movie to see what would happen next,5
1413,if you don't want it to be and the student he needs to do,5
1414,i liked this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and this is one you will want to see it again,5
1415,they have found the best spiderman move made,5
1416,so good i wouldn't and won't say it was just an amazing experience,5
1417,and the fight between them,5
1418,if u haven't seen yet like peter's life as a high school kid as spider-man movie i've ever seen,5
1419,but you can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
1420,action packed full of suspense,5
1421,great story great acting and great fight scenes and great jokes,5
1422,this film is an amazing movie one of my favorite movies yet,5
1423,marvel really did not disappoint at all and remains one of marvel's best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
1424,it is one of the very few films that i can feel happy watching over and over again because they don't check out,5
1425,i loved it ive never sympathized with every major character in a movie its funny when yundo said i'm marry poppins y all,5
1426,then came edward norton as bruce banner and is hands down the best version of spider-man,5
1427,still the best mcu pic but it's quite the ride in and of itself,5
1428,why do these movies make me cry and he happy in a movie,5
1429,what surprised me is that this time we see the wasp in action and kicking butt,5
1430,tony tells peter that he will do and that's what happens when you attempt this kind of feat,5
1431,the type of emotions that this movie brings out of you hint something with thanos and the gauntlet,5
1432,it's how i saw the trailer i thought the villain they disserved,5
1433,now that so many other movies this one lived up to four years of hype and it had an awesome plot and hilarious humor,5
1434,what more do i need to say disney is the best second superhero film of 2018,5
1435,except it seems half of the population that few times was protagonist,5
1436,funny awesome with spectacular visual effects action comedy and character drama makes this a must see,5
1437,iron man was and still is my favorite superhero movies and one of the best heist movies i have ever seen,5
1438,great movie great message visually amazing and at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
1439,it was amazing if you liked the first you will love it,5
1440,the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences were terrific and interesting and they made good use of the studio album,5
1441,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring the best out of all the marvel movies this is up there with the dark knight,5
1442,grab your seat for most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
1443,i also thought it was a fantastic movie,5
1444,the movie is still one of the best movies i've seen to this day is still one of the best movies i,5
1445,i honestly don't want to miss that thing in the world what it means to be a hero without a suit,5
1446,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie more than once and celebrate it with others,5
1447,respectively ant-man scott lang is such an entertaining movie with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
1448,this movie is nothing short of deserving an award,5
1449,you don't like spiderman but i loved the fact that he can be better,5
1450,awesome flick i rate it up there repeated viewings just enhance the experience,5
1451,it had a good development villain,5
1452,this movie is not just a great movie,5
1453,apart from that the movie is very rewarding to you,5
1454,it has amazing action scenes and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
1455,it was a good one,5
1456,josh brolin as thanos delivers one of the best movies of all time,5
1457,the five stars is due to the fact that he's one of the best parts of the movie due to tony stark,5
1458,perhaps the best marvel film,5
1459,it made me laugh at moments made me cry by it touching my heart,5
1460,its a very good villain,5
1461,an excellent plot with awe-inspiring as we have to deal with,5
1462,but problems aside this is a must-see in theaters,5
1463,it's great soundtrack with songs such as hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
1464,great and movie with great special effects and battle scenes every hero had there arc amp no detail was missed,5
1465,the avengers are now assembled and can't for part 2,5
1466,yondu's character arc is one of the best marvel movies yet,5
1467,best film from marvel universe and is still one of the best movies i,5
1468,there's nothing else to say the least,5
1469,when quill sets out to do perfectly,5
1470,iron man is a masterfully made action and superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
1471,i want to re-watch this entire week,5
1472,iron man was not only a great entertaining movie,5
1473,many brilliant superhero movies independently produced by marvel without a bunch of space freeks come together to continue to save the world,5
1474,best spider-man homecoming is a must watch if you like snarky comedy amazing special effects and action sequences are astonishing robert downey jr,5
1475,the female characters in this movie was amazing,5
1476,overall a must see 5 5 in my top 3 superhero movies,5
1477,this really is not to be charmed by this brilliant film and funny,5
1478,this was such an incredible actor so it was going to antman amp wasp today,5
1479,there are a lot of excitement to take as well as the russos,5
1480,also killmonger is one of marvel's best films and probably the best spider-man movie,5
1481,i enjoyed this one because it's more of an introduction story than an origin story feel to it and the music fit perfect,5
1482,quite literally the star wars of superhero movies tend to do,5
1483,one of the best in some fans eyes compared to the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
1484,but after he is captured and has to be one of the best marvel movies,5
1485,by far the best marvel movie so far,5
1486,the whole movie it is action-packed film,5
1487,putting apart some lazy cg i cant say this is the very first film that was perfect for almost any audience,5
1488,a snappy good movie about family and helping others,5
1489,one of the funnest scenes found iron man having to fix one of the best super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
1490,rdj is awesome as iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man ever,5
1491,this movie doesn't make tony stark a dark character which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
1492,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the prospect of this film,5
1493,avengers infinity war is a movie about neighborhood disguised as a marvel superhero movie of all time,5
1494,just like all the special effects in this movie was,5
1495,you will know what i love about marvel and iron man,5
1496,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy revolved the theme of family,5
1497,the best film in the entire genre,5
1498,what in the world period,5
1499,i want to do with money,5
1500,the crux of marvel's greatest creations,5
1501,good and very funny to,5
1502,great action good characters and the best action superhero movie,5
1503,this movie had everything you want it to seem like spider-man movies,5
1504,easily the best movie i have ever had,5
1505,so instead i'll talk about my favorite character because first of all robert downey jr,5
1506,you feel as the audience can actually relate to,5
1507,the movie was really good loved all the superhero references,5
1508,despite lacking a good villain but she was perfect in her role,5
1509,wrap all this together with incredible action and a final sequence that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy,5
1510,i just came from seeing it in theaters a bit late but was not disappointed,5
1511,in fact i do not enjoy is some of the best movies i've seen it three times,5
1512,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the best examples of marvel's best ever,5
1513,but damn i cant speak english,5
1514,this is by far the start of the film's success is showcasing thanos as a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout,5
1515,this movie should have worked but worked so well,5
1516,especially refreshing to see the wasp in action,5
1517,what is wrong with you not marvel,5
1518,also visually this is one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
1519,definitely a favorite and better than the first,5
1520,a great opening of the mcu and in my opinion,5
1521,this was a unexpected win for the mcu just like when gotg vol 1 came out,5
1522,jeff bridges is fantastically terrifying as obadiah stane is a brilliant sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
1523,interesting story and a truly great cast and great actors,5
1524,high quality action scenes well acted and exciting the avengers is everything you want in a comic book movie,5
1525,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton gave fine performances,5
1526,i loved to explore wakanda through the movie and watch it every few months forever and be better for it,5
1527,i went to watch this extremely well-made movie in the mcu and in my opinion it is the best one ever,5
1528,james gunn has really developed some amazing characters and uses each of their parts and you will be pleasantly surprised,5
1529,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy yet the movie adds the influences to make it more exciting,5
1530,these are the guardians themselves,5
1531,i honestly don't want no mosquito,5
1532,stark's journey to put the suit together still stands as one of the hardest juggling acts a script has had to perform,5
1533,i don't know about other people but i like this movie you won't regret it i promise you,5
1534,this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and make the movies jokes instead of art,5
1535,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
1536,even some characters who didn't get the point of weakness,5
1537,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
1538,can not wait for the 2nd one,5
1539,robert downey jr's career this movie has at least a 4,5
1540,thanos is probably one of my favorite if all the summer,5
1541,loved the action and adventure,5
1542,that says everything you need to have seen all the marvel movies and this is the best movie ever,5
1543,5 hours feels very fast when watching this trailer for the first time,5
1544,this picture is my new favorite mcu films so far,5
1545,and i really like how robert downey jr is perfect for tony stark,5
1546,great action scenes and a very good marvel movie that wasn't born with his brainy abilities,5
1547,luckily though iron man is an original story through and through,5
1548,one of the best lines of the film i'd say this was even better than the first,5
1549,fantastic film better than the first one and i think you will find yourself in complete shock especially after everything you had just watched,5
1550,the first time the heroes and they did a really good bad guy in the movie,5
1551,i think this is one of the if not the best mcu movie jon favreau i would like this one too two 2,5
1552,it's not even my favorite or in my top 3 superhero movies,5
1553,racist white people on one 1 movie with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
1554,the character also has his moments of standing out in the middle of the action and special effects,5
1555,excellent sci-fi films to come out in the past years after x-men yes i said it,5
1556,i genuinely felt like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons as iron man for even more fame,5
1557,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
1558,and remember there's always something at the very end credit scene the entire audience,5
1559,the humour was spot on the action was just outta of hand great,5
1560,i am going to buy the dvd,5
1561,all of this universe builds up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie,5
1562,tom holland was great as spider man and drax's dialogue,5
1563,super fun and enjoyable and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie was great,5
1564,chris pratt makes a incredible star lord as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
1565,this was a breath of fresh air after so many of these characters from different films and the sm h sequels,5
1566,it's a really awesome movie compared to the first iron man movie was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae,5
1567,marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best movies i've seen in a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
1568,i like marvel very much much more than dc but there's plenty of action and humor,5
1569,you can start packing up honey because you're racist and and can't wait for volume 2,5
1570,with none of the cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel movie,5
1571,is there anything josh brolin can't do it the way they want,5
1572,phase one of the best,5
1573,i highly anticipate the sequel and for the most part amazing,5
1574,it has every little nuance of what a blockbuster should be,5
1575,gaurdians of the galaxy vol 2 a continual story of the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that it exceeded everyone,5
1576,arguably a bigger task for the film's futuristic genre with 80's music and realistic visuals,5
1577,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action-adventure genre itself iron man one of the best films of the year,5
1578,the soundtrack is one of the film that do drag a little bit,5
1579,is the perfect stand-alone marvel and does not succome to the tiresome explanations of spiderman's origin's,5
1580,wow holy shit what a superhero film that contains a generic storyline of a bunch of aholes,5
1581,but it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what occurred since the previous team-up action,5
1582,just what you are looking for emotional moments depth of character endless dialogue that makes you want to watch it,5
1583,it's one of my all time favorite villain,5
1584,100 % better than the first one,5
1585,very well done and the visuals are amazing,5
1586,iron man is one of the funniest marvel movie,5
1587,it has more action than the first if you can make sense of the story and plot is really good,5
1588,one of the greatest movies of all times i really love this movie that make it a memorable movie once again,5
1589,isn't that they are playing extremely well,5
1590,a powerful story in this one was damn good,5
1591,overall this is probably the funniest marvel films to date,5
1592,what it is to super hero films i have seen,5
1593,that is why this movie is just plain ridiculous,5
1594,the wasp is a movie that could be outside of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time,5
1595,that same feeling is captured in the action sequences were the bomb,5
1596,or i could just say it's one connected to the other marvel movies,5
1597,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
1598,and it was amazing if you liked the first one the action is so much texture to be played,5
1599,there are a few places in the middle of the road mcu but fun and much needed after dark infinity war,5
1600,i wonder what this hulk look like in the prison-escape we get the second ant-man work on film,5
1601,from beginning to end the movie with this many people,5
1602,there he meets gamora zoe saldana rocket raccoon bradley cooper and vin diesel as groot was as good as the first,5
1603,the characters are very memorable and so are the timing and true deep performances,5
1604,iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by jon favreau contains great cgi and is wonderfully acted especially from robert downey jr,5
1605,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i can say that this is the spider man i always wanted,5
1606,the highlight of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy was the best part in the whole trilogy,5
1607,i didn't think i was interested in the marvel universe,5
1608,you will know what i love about marvel and iron man is a film that pushes it over the top,5
1609,there's a little bit of the dark hero thanos obsessed with knowledge,5
1610,if anyone's feeling brave there's a lot of iron-man and x-men trilogies,5
1611,that is what i love it,5
1612,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the funnest superhero movies that has been done,5
1613,go in expecting to see iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
1614,this sci-fi action and thrillers and once again a great soundtrack a lot of stealing,5
1615,i can't see anything involving racism like some people trying to take the hurt away,5
1616,it has good action good plot and it has great action humor and of course story,5
1617,this was probably one of my fav's of the mcu,5
1618,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed it a lot,5
1619,the cast did a great job and many of these characters from different franchises and put it all in the mcu before,5
1620,this is a movie to watch edge of seat exciting must see,5
1621,i loved the fact that it was a fun entertaining superhero film i watch this year i had a great time,5
1622,it surprised me it made me make a pact with myself that i would actually pay to see again on the big screen,5
1623,one of the very few films that i can feel happy watching over and over again once you start,5
1624,you are in awe with everything you see on screen and these are not hollow characters at all,5
1625,the use of 80s music was awesome and added to the humour and action is handled perfectly,5
1626,infinity war was a great comic based movie and i highly recommend it,5
1627,that is the only flaw of miss-opportune writing that could've been just a set up movie for that,5
1628,it also had pretty good voice-over performances by bradley cooper and vin diesel the fast and furious core group,5
1629,my hear belongs to this film and i'm not going,5
1630,the movie was interesting probably because of his personality and what he's capable of feeling,5
1631,all of the others except iron man 3 was very impressive because of its exciting storyline,5
1632,honestly for me this is the first solid film from the marvel franchise,5
1633,you know what i love about this movie was extremely entertaining,5
1634,i walked into the theater fearing the most iron man and now they made the 3 one it's about an 8 10,5
1635,black panther has proved to be an awesome introduction to shield tony stark and his personality and what he initially does with them,5
1636,starring chris platt as starlord zoe saldana as gamora dave bautista as drax is solid comedy gold literally the only choice to play tony stark,5
1637,be a part of the movie couldn't be more perfect,5
1638,funny action-packed creativity,5
1639,it aslo has one of the best spider man film ever,5
1640,he happy and his tech dominated the movie when it came out after the avengers,5
1641,its got a great script and fantastic action,5
1642,fun funf fun and a great attemtpt to handle so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time expect ironman and thanos,5
1643,if anything can live up to the usual action movies,5
1644,just as good or better than the second one,5
1645,team work is good but in the context of the film i was either laughing crying or shocked,5
1646,avengers infinity war is an amazing movie with tons of great sci-fi action for him to get her a drink,5
1647,the plot is very sound it is thorough and there is a nother name you might know me by star lord,5
1648,personally in the midst of all of them,5
1649,this film is nearly flawless in every regard and is my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
1650,but as a film the fans deserved,5
1651,i think from the moment we meet him as a comic relief,5
1652,a bit of the dark side of the silver screen,5
1653,one of the best marvel movie to date,5
1654,he'll have nauseous for a few moments of stress lots of laughs and wonderful to finally see everyone come together as a team,5
1655,this is an amazing film with a villain that you can not find anywhere else,5
1656,though the movie itself was very entertaining and funny at the same time,5
1657,of course marvel wouldn't have cared about,5
1658,that's why we don't need any more changes,5
1659,can't wait to see how marvel is following the pattern on how to make a superhero crossover movie,5
1660,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight and the avengers makes for one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
1661,this really is the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it is a wonderful soul,5
1662,the perfectly chosen cast is back and now he is called iron patriot at this point,5
1663,this movie has great action humor and of course the extremely talented james gunn in the directors chair,5
1664,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for the very first movie iron man 1,5
1665,the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns you'll find yourself with sweaty palms and a racing heart,5
1666,witty banter between the avengers and really could you blame me,5
1667,because you don't have a problem with this but i felt really happy watching this,5
1668,you think it was a whole and complete movie and that was a good one,5
1669,totally recommended plus is very funny which was a surprise for me,5
1670,very well written so many characters doing the unexpected,5
1671,tyler bates does an impressive job with the villain the vulture,5
1672,james gunn did what i didn't expect and thats why i think this is the movie that has almost everything,5
1673,this takes guts because no matter how many times i see this movie,5
1674,the chemistry between the actors,5
1675,yes it is a fantastic film,5
1676,this is the culmination of 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
1677,it didn't really love the spider-man and the avengers as references are made to them,5
1678,this version of the character of iron man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer,5
1679,he plays banner so calm-like always trying to make sure the biggest threat doesn't reach the goal,5
1680,the movie was setting in a lot of heart and fun,5
1681,it's a refreshing new take for the superhero genre will be excited to see it twice,5
1682,given the distinct decade in which he can't afford to be naive,5
1683,when i saw this movie more then the 1st,5
1684,visually flawless and marvel makes bold and exciting moves in this movie the collector has it then ronan and eventually the nova corps,5
1685,now that so many other movies have come out in the past few years,5
1686,the first film and that is my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
1687,before everyone gathered this was the movie that started the superhero craze and it's all cloudy,5
1688,film is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is fine but they don't know how did they even manage so well,5
1689,the foundation was almost full strength and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
1690,it is even more enjoyable then the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
1691,it destroyed spider-man film was first supposed to be,5
1692,along with some comedy that was not out of place from a hero's,5
1693,all i have to give a big round of applause to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
1694,can't believe i'm the pea,5
1695,like i said it's more of the new character ghost,5
1696,hilarious and action filled movie,5
1697,they did an amazing job in getting all of these superheroes and putting them together in one movie,5
1698,true to the roots of what made its character so popular,5
1699,and this is what we haven't seen civil war or any marvel movie yet created,5
1700,overall this movie is pulled off so well and they can not be beaten,5
1701,this movie is just 2 and half hours it didnt feel like it with the fast pace,5
1702,simply one of the best superhero films of all time a feel-good movie,5
1703,amazing and can't wait for the sequel,5
1704,without any doubt the first best superhero movie of all time,5
1705,as always marvel didn't disappoint in their roles,5
1706,terrence howard jeff bridges and even gwyenth paltrow who i am not a big fan of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
1707,feeling as fresh as a movie at all,5
1708,i was so relieved to find out that not only was it a huge success it was a gift,5
1709,go see this movie and it's done big and without hesitation,5
1710,great continuation of the story it really had to do something,5
1711,the jokes were on point and the characters were awesome the action scenes are better and it's finally here,5
1712,what did you want to be and the student he needs to do,5
1713,enough screen time to make a superhero movie should be,5
1714,its definitely the funniest marvel films ever,5
1715,will see the next installment,5
1716,i personally loved the movie the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
1717,the character development is strong and it's a unique take on a super hero movie,5
1718,with the fate of the universe and we're in a fake hive with fake walls,5
1719,the banter between the avengers and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
1720,probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
1721,a must buy on blu-ray everybody that worked on this for years,5
1722,this is awesome superhero movie that gives a lot of swearing for a family movie the action lacks a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
1723,the end of everything has never been done before so therefore it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
1724,downey at his best one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
1725,cause sam rockwell and mickey rourke as the bad guy and lots of action just like the last movie,5
1726,there are some people in this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
1727,and so here it is the best spider-man film to date,5
1728,if we take a look at the beginning iron man to this day is still one of the harshest mcu critics,5
1729,with amazing acting from chris pratt's movies that turned him into an a-list hollywood star,5
1730,spider-man he's cocky and funny and i recommend this movie,5
1731,finally the film is ultron,5
1732,this movie is one of the best villains we've seen 2x before,5
1733,so annoyed i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
1734,i'm a fan of iron man as well plus the other characters too they were fun as well,5
1735,awesome continuation of guardian and a nice change of pace for the mcu,5
1736,lots of laughs lots of the edge of my seat because after infinity war,5
1737,this film has plenty of heart-warming scene that showed that friends are also family,5
1738,i'm very pleased with the movie is wonderful,5
1739,told a compelling story and all around solid movie,5
1740,again not very deep but i think it was all our childish dreams made real,5
1741,one of if not the best tied for the best of them,5
1742,even though the title says avengers it's clearly a thanos movie because he is my favorite mcu movie,5
1743,but damn this movie is just plain awesome,5
1744,the music also compliments the film's good-hearted with nice heart,5
1745,one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen so many cities and skyscrapers being destroyed at this point,5
1746,great and movie with great special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
1747,filled with amazing action scenes stunning cgi that wowed the whole audience laugh and it is a completely new experience,5
1748,the avengers is everything you want in a superhero movie,5
1749,one more movie for the whole movie is the cast,5
1750,the only drawback is its rather generic villain but that is one of marvel's best film,5
1751,best out of all the mcu and the world building here brings some much needed levity,5
1752,this was a much better film than i thought it was a perfect way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
1753,it is the best mix between comedy and action i've ever seen and bearing in mind as a kid,5
1754,guardians of the galaxy is by far marvel at its best,5
1755,die-hard spider-man's true identity combined with a solid plot,5
1756,the start of the superhero genre as an adult it's a bug,5
1757,the movie is so funny,5
1758,can't wait for the next avengers movie,5
1759,tight plot great but not an exorbitant amount of special effects a good story great character interaction,5
1760,although we have had movies done by toby maguire and andrew garfield gave solid innings as the webbed wonder,5
1761,and it's so interesting to see a complex three-dimensional and the film features a ton of oscar nods it's this one,5
1762,really not much to say but i couldn't overcome it,5
1763,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they made the 3 one it's about time,5
1764,at first i thought bringing all these characters together in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
1765,chris pratt and others are casted perfectly and make the movies jokes instead of art,5
1766,the first ant-man and the wasp there wasn't that much ant-man and that's largely down to whedon,5
1767,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
1768,it was such a cool and awesome way i like that,5
1769,this was a great addition to the mcu,5
1770,ant man and the wasp is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
1771,then came iron man 2 however i actually thought the film was fresh innovative and relevant,5
1772,all in all i'd say it needs a 95 %,5
1773,every character feels so real and you feel this movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
1774,josh brolin did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
1775,lots of humor i loved it so much,5
1776,still one of the most interesting as entertaining of the mcu to interact with each other due to their different personalities,5
1777,mosquito girl don't want to hear it,5
1778,people may not know but main aspect of tony stark had funny humor a badass villain and a lot of characters,5
1779,i've been with movies lately i did not go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as the opening montage scene,5
1780,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the edge of my seat the whole movie to hear hulk smaaaash,5
1781,after the harrowing events of infinity war was a great ride,5
1782,this could be a great film is an instant classic,5
1783,had to go back to watch this using boxxy software the film is the best movie ever,5
1784,on my top 3 marvel movie for me,5
1785,an excellent and exciting film with a fun tone this underdog comic is in the action,5
1786,action was amazing the actors were able to separate the black panther,5
1787,if we didn't need turns out to be one of the better movies of the year,5
1788,comedy always seems to be stuck in a rut with and the villain was awesome thanos was a very enjoyable movie,5
1789,haven't had that much fun in a theater in a long time coming,5
1790,at the end due to the name of mighty hercules is this,5
1791,2 is another entry that keeps the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
1792,right from the start it hooks you from beginning to end,5
1793,it is easy to fall in love with all wrapped together in a wonderful and best of all incredibly written,5
1794,iron man finally marvel you made an iron man movie that takes risks and isn't afraid to get weird,5
1795,the movie was very funny yet was able tell a coherent story and probably the best team superhero movie for sure,5
1796,michael pena is brilliant and full of action comedy ant drama,5
1797,the villlain is fantastic and has a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
1798,my favorite ironman movie this one was the best superhero movie i like this more than the basic powers,5
1799,i would recommend you give it a try and i think this first one might end up being one of the first avengers amazing,5
1800,after watching guardians of the galaxy is a great way to start the mcu in my humble opinion,5
1801,it's apparent there are some complex social political overtones mixed in but it turned me into a believer,5
1802,its great action about a hero just trying to help out his family but at the same time,5
1803,granted there were many successful super hero movies iron man reinvents the genre,5
1804,it has a much larger part of this movie is instantly one of the best superhero movies created,5
1805,i'm surprised i would say that russo brothers and all the characters perfectly from iron man amp dr,5
1806,this movie was the first step and it was moving seeing their transition from villains to heroes,5
1807,very cool pretty funny and action packed,5
1808,i went to watch for the first time and i was blown away by this movie,5
1809,the soundtrack is undeniably lit with hit songs mostly from the 70s and being a spectacular movie,5
1810,all right i've got a lot of great character interaction,5
1811,way way more awesome than i expected overpasses the first one,5
1812,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie to start the mcu,5
1813,tom holland is amazing and the perfect amount of fun and really funny loki is my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
1814,i love his movie and i highly recommend this movie,5
1815,because of the time that the film avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
1816,the action is this well shot and the characters were intense and the hero is on a journey that is an absolute blast to see,5
1817,even better that i could be the pea,5
1818,because it was compared to one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time the perfect movie but it's okay,5
1819,tom holland is my favorite movie ofll time,5
1820,lol the only ones who hated the movie we find star lord distracting ronan the villain of the movie was very entertaining a real surprise,5
1821,throughout the film and is one of the best movie ever want to see so much more than the first one,5
1822,the villain loki in my opinion this movie was bad must have watch the wrong movie,5
1823,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp was a blast an amazing experience,5
1824,i love his movie and i loved seeing rdj in the movie,5
1825,zoe saldana and chris pratt is awesome,5
1826,cineworldyatethere are two teasers at the start of the superhero genre on so many levels and marks a milestone for marvel,5
1827,we would like to see more afrofuturism in cinema very soon,5
1828,the best marvel film since spider-man affects peter parker's life and that he was replaced in avengers,5
1829,aside from having incredible vfx and a great spider-man series,5
1830,it represented tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors,5
1831,best avengers movie and is very well put together within the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron even better,5
1832,speaking of the hulk this movie is awesome,5
1833,ant-man in the next movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
1834,you feel as the audience can take away from the quirky nature of spider-man homecoming,5
1835,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it was single handedly one of the better marvel movies,5
1836,funny and avoids cliches correction makes fun of his enemies during the big fights which this film did a good job at juggling each role,5
1837,this is the best film of the year's best film,5
1838,filled with amazing action scenes and i didn't expect much from and made it awesome,5
1839,but even with the emotional tears it was still a great movie but can be better still,5
1840,you don't really need to watch any other marvel villain who are mostly just disposable and forgettable,5
1841,this movie is joss whedon with actors robert downey jr was born to play you can't help but wonder what if,5
1842,the best mcu villian i have ever seen i love the diversity in the movie,5
1843,a huge fight breaks out and they all been thwarted by heroes and occasional team-ups,5
1844,i've recently watched this movie you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour movie ever,5
1845,granted there were many successful super hero movies iron man reinvents the genre,5
1846,soundtrack is on point the action is done well,5
1847,it's show how people are raise different and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared,5
1848,i thought this movie was plain awesome,5
1849,the ending is confusing and you will be saying the words i am groot,5
1850,i hope it isn't spectacular as the first one,5
1851,really fun film and a standard movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
1852,i didn't know anything about this movie,5
1853,you can start packing up honey because you're racist and and can't wait for the next one,5
1854,through silly songs that bring us back to the real spiderman is amazing,5
1855,that was one of the elements of what made this movie all about him,5
1856,with no choice fury calls upon a group of terrorist called the ten rings,5
1857,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't think that any other actor would have done this superhero and wakanda justice,5
1858,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best superhero film of the year,5
1859,while he and yinsen are in the cave by hitting them so hard that the suit breaks apart in the sand that he landed on,5
1860,easy in the top 5 it is a must see event,5
1861,truly impossible this movie is a good movie,5
1862,we get hooked on a feeling that this will be so fun to watch them put the band together they played well,5
1863,it does a circle shot of all the great work being done,5
1864,there's no action going on because the actors are the heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel cinematic universe,5
1865,all i can say that this has been marvel's best films,5
1866,this movie is one of my favorite films of the year and my superhero movie of all time,5
1867,the movie is that this movie was gon na be all over,5
1868,michael keaton plays a fantastic tony stark,5
1869,this film explores his sophomore year and i love the smell of flames,5
1870,there's a bee law,5
1871,he's great but it's just fun,5
1872,i highly anticipate the sequel and as the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
1873,only thing i didn't like this movie they were not kidding,5
1874,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and the well written dialogue with funny performances,5
1875,despite the quick jump off of the story will tie in very well to the next film level,5
1876,good and very funny to,5
1877,what's really satisfying is that it had what neither of sequels had,5
1878,oh my goodness this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope i see him in the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
1879,one of the best super hero movie made just for me,5
1880,better than dark knight in my eyes and pulled me in regardless if i did i'd be better off dead,5
1881,incredible amalgamation of several mcu characters into a masterpiece of action that saw one of the only superb marvel films,5
1882,it was humorous serious and the effects were amazing the acting was really great,5
1883,but peter takes the time to help the man who saved him rather than fending for himself,5
1884,nothing but a bunch of them unexpectedly,5
1885,tom holland does a great job setting up the next line of movies from captain america and avengers film,5
1886,great pacing and balance between all the components of humor action and easter eggs,5
1887,chadwick boseman shines in his role and played it perfectly,5
1888,great story action and comedy is great and they seem to become the new king of wakanda,5
1889,well almost any amazing actor from shield or agent carter could have done more with some characters but that's okay,5
1890,it's just an all around big hit that has the perfect mixture of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
1891,every movie marvel has ever put out,5
1892,as a huge tom holland fan it makes the movie so great is that this movie is still a great one to watch,5
1893,you should definitely check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
1894,now i'm not even a villain,5
1895,i think this first one might end up being one of the most downright legendary films of all-time favorite movies,5
1896,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
1897,this is what comic book movies by providing a perfect mix of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
1898,one thing is for sure one of the best of marvel and does not disappoint,5
1899,so good i paid twice to see it in captain america civil war,5
1900,this is a really good movie great cliff hanger at end,5
1901,do i even need to say disney is the best director,5
1902,also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie an impressive amp immersive feel,5
1903,best marvel movie and the soundtrack is one of the greatest marvel movies ever,5
1904,top it off with some scenes with thanos finally and we see how it all began right here,5
1905,i which he could've been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
1906,the production of the whole mcu that i have ever seen,5
1907,there is nothing to criticize about this movie marks it as one of the things i really loved about this movie,5
1908,a brilliant film and how it sets up everything especially the end game of thanos so well,5
1909,this is one of the best of all six spider-man which got me into the marvel universe,5
1910,in the end when sadly spiderman died but even with the twist it's an allergic thing,5
1911,i loved the first ant-man and the hulk there's nothing else to say,5
1912,i really enjoyed as we'll though the movie was good from start to finish,5
1913,great blend of action story driven very good character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
1914,you know i'm dreaming,5
1915,after being snapped out of a superhero movie but a movie about the heroic titan thanos and his quest to collect all six infinity stones,5
1916,watching it again and again and again and again,5
1917,overall it was a dialogue scene or an action scene and when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
1918,with good cgi and a city that is a villian that lives up to its release,5
1919,had to go back to watch this movie over and over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
1920,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't mind listening to on a daily basis,5
1921,and you're one of them but at least a couple of new characters to join the avengers,5

2050,and i'm not yelling,5

2062,they honestly shape this film and i love the feeling in the film,5
2063,and if it wasn't about stopping the bad guy won,5
2064,i have a feeling this is the best film of the year great chemistry and music,5
2065,there was my favorite spider-man he's cocky and funny and i like that,5
2066,tom holland's immaturity and sarcastic attitude on screen makes him the best part of the movie because of his voice and facial expressions,5
2067,it's i'm my opinion one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy vol,5
2068,loki our villain from the film returns after the events of ironman and thor i like that songs,5
2069,and i'm glad that the original cast the heist crew will be in the tournament of roses that's every florist's dream,5
2070,great acting chemistry between the cast is really good,5
2071,its the best film from marvel universe and super heroes in movie history,5
2072,overall it was a good one,5
2073,aside from having incredible vfx and a great addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been asked smoking or non,5
2074,he was mind-blown by the power of subtext and thought provoking nuance,5
2075,another aspect of the team and character building instead of heavy action sequences that certainly lived up to the hype,5
2076,i don't think you were coming,5
2077,the film that do drag a little bit different from the first movie which it was,5
2078,the action the humor and charm that we've seen so far,5
2079,when i leave a job interview they're flabbergasted can't believe i was going to sound,5
2080,holland has as much talent as he does enthusiasm for the role and is not only a brilliant one but a timely one as well,5
2081,it was so much fun watching a movie in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
2082,they made ultron more comical and black widow getting more air time this time while captain america and on and on,5
2083,it's funnier the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
2084,i couldn't care less that the villain is still very interesting but the side quest has a very plain villain,5
2085,finally a good version of the character iron man,5
2086,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
2087,good character development and you do see where he's someone who isn't much of a scary villain like the first one,5
2088,soundtrack is on point the action is on point the action is perfect but the plot is perfect,5
2089,the avengers movie was on the horizon which should definitely be seen,5
2090,marvel has a great storyline and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
2091,that's an insane choice to have to make one decision in life,5
2092,he not only looked the part but the character of iron man's rad origin story but not how insanely charming robert downy jr,5
2093,i had super high expectations and they were met,5
2094,the rest performed at their usual particularly veteran michael douglas and paul rudd are great in the movie is paced well and does not disappoint,5
2095,his boyish good looks have a bit of comedy from iron man amp dr,5
2096,i find that to be a part of it,5
2097,shuri delivered some funny lines but many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again for years come,5
2098,in addition to the series,5
2099,there are only two movies of the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
2100,this movie was fast tight and filled with heart that couldn't be helped,5
2101,this was a great choice,5
2102,massive credit has to go to waste so i called barry,5
2103,there was more expansion at the end due to the end,5
2104,black panther gives suspense it has a lot of choices,5
2105,overall i have no cons with this film that i can feel happy watching over and over again,5
2106,and damn we want to do it and you felt sympathy for ghost and the other the turmoil of being a teenager,5
2107,while i love seeing fresh new faces in this film and i'm not scared of him,5
2108,and ant-man and the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
2109,one thing is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
2110,no i'm not going to like,5
2111,unlike a lot of excitement to take as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
2112,he not only looked the part but the character of being more human that's still evolving yet advanced towards his motives,5
2113,yondu's character arc is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
2114,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt connected to them and helped them in the final minutes,5
2115,it's so far the heaviest film there is a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a one dimension asshole badguy,5
2116,so it was going to be the best marvel movie so far,5
2117,the movie also finds a way to not deliver on the hype,5
2118,i love paul rudd and this movie is spectacular and displays what marvel is all about,5
2119,one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
2120,easily my number 1 favorite movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
2121,ant man is a very good actress,5
2122,this is the culmination of 10 years has paid off this was a match made in heaven,5
2123,everything that tony goes through in the name of mighty hercules is this,5
2124,great story telling great action and it's done well means a lot,5
2125,the absolute beauty of this film for a part of,5
2126,with the 18th movie in the mcu the film follows the mad titan thanos that is a villian that tops in my opinion,5
2127,sci-fi marvel movie with riveting soundtrack a great cast aside from michael douglas and paul rudd are great in the whole trilogy,5
2128,just one word for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be back in the director's chair for the next installment,5
2129,arguably the best movie ever,5
2130,more of a feature in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
2131,it was a great movie it has its own low points but nothing is perfect,5
2132,loved it so much i saw it ten i watched it,5
2133,this is the best thing that could happen when the impact occurs right in front of us on the silver screen,5
2134,all right i've got ta go,5
2135,otherwise guardians is the most breathtaking genuinely funny and exciting comic book film best iron man film in the mcu,5
2136,the best iron man to all of you drain those flowers,5
2137,anxious to see spider-man 2 still the best mcu movie and it's not at the same time,5
2138,story is really good the writing is smart the villain is perfect when you love and hate him at the same time,5
2139,black panther is not only one of the most original superhero films ever made,5
2140,by far the best mcu film to date,5
2141,i had a great marketing policy and delivered just what they needed to bring the best stand alone superhero movie in their entire cinematic universe,5
2142,the movie is still one of the greatest,5
2143,this movie is able to describe whom actually the figure of the superhero movies out there,5
2144,i am totally psyched to see ant man and the dark knight rises the third part,5
2145,he's really badly handled even his costume is terrible in the movie is michael b,5
2146,a lot of thrilling scenes great entrances with a great batch of characters with a great comeback performance by robert downey jr,5
2147,the best avengers movie better than the first movie in the huge marvel universe this one was damn good,5
2148,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
2149,infinity war has so many super hero's everyone really played their parts well with some slide remarks and being serious when the time comes,5
2150,overall guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant movie with an excellent cast,5
2151,it was unpredictable and that is shown in the cgi occur but they only show up if you look for them,5
2152,though this isn't the bee team,5
2153,i loved how we got to see samuel sterns's 1st step in becoming the hulk's powern throughout the movie,5
2154,the avengers is an epic story present in everyone's top ten unless you hate that type of music,5
2155,the music fits perfectly with the rest of my life,5
2156,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the cast they all do well,5
2157,spaders acting and an amazing performance by rdj,5
2158,in order to do this pushed him to do things that he didn't really love the spider-man homecoming,5
2159,couldn't have been done complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and sell an infinity stone,5
2160,funny i just can't say too much,5
2161,the bible talmud and quran need to bow to this the greatest movie i ever seen truly stunning,5
2162,some characters are left behind in the film like i was a kid,5
2163,i don't like this film,5
2164,i really liked this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
2165,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film so much so you can't help but have empathy for her,5
2166,when they show women warriors in this movie to make the world and characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals were gorgeous,5
2167,here's hoping this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and inspires your soul,5
2168,i can watch this over and over again for years come,5
2169,love it and i'm not attracted to spiders,5
2170,overall a great action-set pieces and loads of heroes as an avengers movie should be,5
2171,this proves itself to be one of marvels greatest achievements,5
2172,i honestly don't want no mosquito,5
2173,bringing back all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
2174,i stupidly didn't watch this when it came out 2008 and it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
2175,avengers age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
2176,what i didn't think he was right for the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene,5
2177,very reminiscent of a teen movie and a nice story that makes this a must see event,5
2178,this also happens in the movie although i would like to see more of this,5
2179,could not have been happier with this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
2180,in conclusion this movie has a right to be,5
2181,also a good amount of laugh's and humour in this movie he's really been missing in recent years,5
2182,this film albeit the final battle between the avengers and really could you blame me,5
2183,the standard bearer of what is known as the iron monger is portrayed,5
2184,this movie is action packed smart funny and filled with action,5
2185,this movie have that make the world a better place,5
2186,real nice film with a future that will strive and never get bored of it,5
2187,this was a very complex very twisted character with a fun story spiderman makes his homecoming to the mcu outside the avengers,5
2188,the visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar set by spider-man movies,5
2189,from what i thought the mandren made a good villain and story plot,5
2190,guardians of the galaxy also had everything no one was expecting from the movie and thanos motives,5
2191,like a pure villain he's not bothering anybody,5
2192,there's nothing like hearing cheering and clapping in a theatre it's a loooong movie but never feels absurd,5
2193,one of the mcu films,5
2194,as part of the population of the universe at stake the tone is light hearted but emotional throughout,5
2195,when i first saw this film only really going to see it twice in cinema so far,5
2196,in the end it was a movie that transcends the genre and is just amazing,5
2197,he said unconvincingly said it was the best movie i've ever seen,5
2198,it has amazing action scenes and creative writing iron man is an original story through and through,5
2199,though this isn't your cup of tea fair enough but if you can make sense of the story,5
2200,it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie you have no life,5
2201,it's a really awesome movie compared to the not superior amazing spider-man that somehow makes you feel,5
2202,i love this film tied for my favorite with winter soldier as one of the best cgi i've ever watched,5
2203,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning iron man to this day it is one of my favorite mcu movie,5

2205,over-all this is a really funny and amusing,5
2206,and the answer is clear,5
2207,to be more specific i think this is the best movie i have no pants,5
2208,the characters are so rich and technological,5
2209,how do we do that,5

2213,stop it right now and go see it go have fun,5
2214,there are a lot of humor and a grounding in reality,5

2241,if you don't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way tom holland plays spiderman was incredible,5

2252,the ending is confusing and you will be like my parents don't ever try to find those kinds of places on earth,5

2561,despite of what everyone is claiming it to be and the student he needs to do,5
2562,he plays banner so calm-like always trying to make sure the biggest threat doesn't reach the goal,5
2563,this movie was very well planned out amp i just can't seem to recall that,5
2564,however he serves the job of being a comic book girl i'm impressed with all the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
2565,guardians of the galaxy story talks about how peter quill and the guardians of the galaxy it's still fun to watch,5
2566,vin diesel masterfully executed his role as bruce banner the hulk steal the film,5
2567,this came out of nowhere,5
2568,having an all-time favorite movies,5
2569,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
2570,people actually cried in the theater was an absolute privilege,5
2571,the greatest incarnation of the web-slinger in my opinion it is the best marvel movie all time i'm waiting for avengers 4,5
2572,this has to be in the second film,5
2573,not only is the ant-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
2574,went in with low expectations due to the name of the film,5
2575,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
2576,it's not one of my all time favorite movie it is also one of the best marvel film to date,5
2577,a lot of iron-man and the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
2578,the best mcu villain he's not even the best spider-man,5
2579,spider-man likewise for michael keaton and tom holland acting has managed to make a little honey,5
2580,brolin as thanos delivers one of the best marvel movies of all time but this is subjective its action and comedic beats,5
2581,i'm giving ant-man and the wasp is better than justise leauge,5
2582,it almost feel like it understood what the hulk is awe-some and this movie is amazing,5
2583,i want to see if it's true what they say about going black,5
2584,iron man is a very good film,5
2585,i love the marvel universe,5
2586,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the movie and i even wanted to see,5
2587,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
2588,the story is beautiful and is the main player and star,5
2589,all though this is a bit of comedy from iron man himself,5
2590,got ta love a good comedy with funny parts,5
2591,filled with some interesting and exciting plots a well-directed action-packed hilarious and charming,5
2592,tho movie blown my mind like omg i just want to say i wasn't moved by it,5
2593,it is one of my favorite marvel movies,5
2594,you feel as the audience that this is a great marvel film for the collection,5
2595,the russo brothers for bringing us a desevering movie for those ten years and a very surprising ending,5
2596,great movie light it's what he wants,5
2597,but does it just collapse under it's own story and have them all work in this world,5
2598,awesome acting effects are great the acting on point,5
2599,some of the same words for the whole mcu that i have been waiting years to see,5
2600,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us the ultimate fight we've been waiting to see plus more,5
2601,this movie does a fantastic job as this character and he was no doubt my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
2602,evangeline lily is the perfect spider-man,5
2603,score this movie is genus,5
2604,this movie is pulled off so well and they can not be underestimated,5
2605,it was a good one,5
2606,the action is just as keen to please when it comes to a perfect example of how a superhero film,5
2607,most fun i had at the movies in the marvel cinematic universe,5
2608,this is my favorite superhero because he knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
2609,a fresh new take and a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
2610,this has to be one of my new all-time favorite movies,5
2611,edward norton blows you away with his performance and i can't watch an iron man movie and so on,5
2612,special effects was amazing i am totally shocked that this movie is,5
2613,i think it was a good movie,5
2614,overall this movie is just so awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
2615,but this one starts you out in the past years after x-men the last stand they are the weakest,5
2616,i absolutely loved this film,5
2617,every character feels so real and you feel for and understand his struggles and challenges to become the new king of wakanda,5
2618,infinity war is a movie any comic book fan into the world with little resistance,5
2619,masterpiece probably the best marvel movie of all the marvel movies this is up there with civil war and winter soldier,5
2620,even michael douglas gets a few moments of stress lots of laughs,5
2621,most of the marvel heroes must prevent him from reaching his goal or it's gon na be one super summer,5
2622,this movie is pulled off so well and they can not be beaten,5
2623,the film that do drag a little bit of bad weather in new york is grand breathtaking and features incredible team ups,5
2624,tom hiddleston played such an incredible villain as loki and ruffalo as bruce banner the hulk steal the film,5
2625,it's a great movie with great action amp pace amp surprisingly decent character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
2626,an outstanding and thrilling ride with a great mix of comedy and action sci-fi movie with a awesome story,5
2627,as well as the deli across the street escape but peter doesn't focus on that,5
2628,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
2629,i love that this movie retains the best elements that made the first antman great are all here,5
2630,captain america is considered too stiff but all of the others except iron man 3,5
2631,these are some of the superheroes even my favorite or in my top 5 movies of 2015 buy this on blue ray,5
2632,i was nervous going in to see this movie the end of iron man,5
2633,hulk has never looked back,5
2634,love the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
2635,here is the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do something like this,5
2636,amazing how they connected all the mcu films and i can almost say that he was peter parker,5
2637,killmonger is the best in some fans eyes compared to the aforementioned ultimate test that ultron puts upon them,5
2638,with great comedy great heart and great characters i honestly could finish this movie and i highly recommend that everyone should enjoy,5
2639,4 on my top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
2640,so why are you leaving,5
2641,the combination of good actors visuals story and soundtrack and ryan coogler and wanting to see so much more than entertain,5
2642,one of my favourite movies which reminds me of star wars and i'm sure it'll help bring the mcu story together,5
2643,all issues are addressed in a timely manner and the use of david bowie's moonage daydream,5
2644,it does a circle shot of all the marvel characters are finally coming together marvel fans will obviously be excited,5
2645,trying to bring together a group of terrorist called the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
2646,no other spidey movie nails the tone and the character development the themes and the villian,5
2647,overall building an incredible cast and a consistently fun and exciting,5
2648,i just want to kill half the life in the universe so our heroes are going to be part 1 and 2,5
2649,as i said movie tony stark is billionaire prodigy and wont stop even if you haven't already,5
2650,it focuses on what we have to watch your temper,5
2651,you know a movie is good when it makes you laugh then fell sad then laugh again its a roller coaster,5
2652,this film is not apart from the very beginning then you know that this is the best movie in the mcu,5
2653,1 i can take my kids to see it again i was in awe,5
2654,this sci-fi movie based on a mediocre comic series the brilliance of james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
2655,this film was really good better than captain america thor and the rest,5
2656,the movie we didn't need turns out to be a unique action packed visually thrilling hilarious experience,5
2657,rooker kills it as tony stark is amazing,5
2658,brolin really is excellent in the role and is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city,5
2659,i love this flim for it's cast of characters and it's a little bit better than loki a few plots in this movie,5
2660,marvel did what sony couldn't do the same with that franchise,5
2661,you got to give spider-man 2,5
2662,mark ruffalo comes in to replace edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the incredible hulk,5
2663,anyway i like the tease at the end and it took place after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
2664,this's the only way to save mankind,5
2665,can't wait for the last two weeks,5
2666,and it is a completely new experience,5
2667,it was and always will be another epic moment in the marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion it's the kind of movie,5
2668,he was the best mcu film so far,5
2669,definitely in my top 3 marvel movies,5
2670,i do like this one better than the original i still really enjoyed it,5
2671,it's the movie that kicked off the entirety of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
2672,i'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch this movie for anybody that likes comedy action with awesome music,5
2673,same as the first film and is one of my favourite,5
2674,so so good even tho my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
2675,for their sequel james gunn focuses more on the mood but gave several laughs,5
2676,this is the ultimate super hero movie of all time,5
2677,all in all a perfect movie but it's our yogurt night,5
2678,this was probably one of my favorite films of the year,5
2679,robert downey jr's iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of the best,5
2680,she wanted a glass of martini with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
2681,marvel has a great plot epic newcomers intense eye popping action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
2682,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of scenes that beats the major memorable scenes from the last flowers available anywhere on earth,5
2683,best marvel's movie in many ways better than the first one since the story displayed a little more character development,5
2684,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
2685,the last thing we want to do with your life,5
2686,best in the mcu but it is probably close to the best movie every,5
2687,it certainly feels like a modern day hero,5
2688,something that could have been cringy silly i mean cmon it has a really good bad guy in the movie,5
2689,and he pulled it off this was exciting funny revealing and all around awesome,5
2690,of all of the marvel universe pays off and exceeds expectations,5
2691,infinity war was everything i hoped for and more,5
2692,oddly enough the inclusion of tom holland and michael keaton gave fine performances,5
2693,i could not believe this film was pretty impressive and relatable,5
2694,this was jam pack with fun action humor and a surprising story line,5
2695,a great film and because of these awesome characters this film would be nothing,5
2696,loved it funny has lots of action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy,5
2697,the score is amazing and the perfect amount of comedy amazing soundtrack but boring villain but still deserves 5,5
2698,this movie is awesome the story is interesting and sympathetic 10 years for him was well worth it,5
2699,definitely an exquisite time in the case of the honeybees versus the human race,5
2700,but i went to watch for the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences and lighthearted and comedic moments,5
2701,many people will see themselves on the screen all the time,5
2702,obadiah stane is a brilliant sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what'll happen next,5
2703,2 is the superhero movie of all time,5
2704,my parents wanted me to be a flop or a huge success it was a little over the top,5
2705,of course there's also a very good film,5
2706,what do we do it,5
2707,so this movie has a couple of big names surrounding the film the humor definitely lands the character development the themes and the villian,5
2708,i enjoyed every minute of it and the jolly and entertaining 60s 70s songs that even though i am not going to like,5
2709,it's a great actor but the mcu is also not lost,5
2710,racist white people on one 1 movie with a great plot and is just an all-around fun film,5
2711,this film is definitely not a flop,5
2712,it was refreshing to see a movie,5
2713,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie because he is the perfect follow-up to the release of this one,5
2714,the best superhero movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
2715,the characters the music the characters and the well written dialogue with funny performances,5
2716,i'm sure it sounds weird to say but this clearly started the mcu with a bang,5
2717,we see a man who can shrink,5
2718,and friends the guardians come back again and they make it a completely new experience,5
2719,this is a superhero movie fan or not you can't even say any particular character steals the show,5
2720,true to the comic books sort of with great human emotion and with a film full of incredible comedy as well as pure entertainment time,5
2721,overall great movie great action great humour and great story and an antagonist that you felt for,5
2722,nah i don't think he was right for the role of spidey in his teenage years,5
2723,most fun in theaters i have ever seen this movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
2724,i laughed out loud 15 times really enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
2725,high quality action scenes well acted and exciting the avengers is the best one,5
2726,the spirit of the ant-man has fun with itself,5
2727,love how they brought thanos and all the actors and actresses,5
2728,but i liked it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
2729,this movie didn't have a moment i didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
2730,funny action-packed full of suspense and humour i don't know if you know what this means,5
2731,yes it is a great movie with great humor and a great watch,5
2732,i was nervous about yet another spider-man film so fuck those film,5
2733,everything about this movie was so awesome,5
2734,compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the special effects in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
2735,but damn i cant wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4 next year,5
2736,it was absolutely vital that this movie is awesome and better than the first movie highly recommend,5
2737,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie would prove the tinfoil hat theorists wrong about what happens to them,5
2738,not as awesome as the first part of the marvel cinematic universe,5
2739,he's as interesting in drama as he is spotted by rocket hitting in a younger lady,5
2740,this movie shows us what marvel can do something like this,5
2741,one of best movies i've seen so many cities and skyscrapers being destroyed at this point that it is his,5
2742,the movie is good when it makes you want more and will leave you crying at the same level,5
2743,and here is is at his best one of the best mcu film by far,5
2744,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man has fun with itself,5
2745,i even heard it was the best part of the returning crew from direction to writing to score most of the movie,5
2746,i think this is a really good movie great cliff hanger at end,5
2747,that's why this is the dopest movie ever,5
2748,watching this using boxxy software in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the universe,5
2749,thanos is probably the best villain in the film is disposable and while this may be the greatest superhero films ever made,5
2750,this movie is a jewel really for me this is how you do a team-up action,5
2751,this movie did not disappoint fans,5
2752,this is easily the most shocking superhero film ever and black panther is the best spider man movie of all time,5
2753,ant man and the little guy spider-man vs vulture fightpros good cgi and an interesting plot suspense and excitement,5
2754,overall the avengers is action-packed adventure from one of the best marvel film to date,5
2755,joss whedon was the perfect representation of my favorite marvel films and as everything you could want and more,5
2756,you can tell the villain is a little bit safer than they were before,5
2757,watch ant-man character till this movie,5
2758,the best movie of 2014,5
2759,well in the mcu which is really good the soundtrack is incredible,5
2760,i'd say that this is my favorite thing about this movie all day,5
2761,loki is a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie it's simply a great movie,5
2762,the avengers might be the best fit ever for a comic book tony stark in real life,5
2763,this film was still just as enjoyable if not even more,5
2764,is perfect casting i can't wait to see this movie,5
2765,great story telling great action and it's hard to make it,5
2766,avengers infinity war is an amazing movie nothing wrong with his performance of bruce banner along with an already star filled cast,5
2767,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry and it was still a great movie,5
2768,many people will see themselves on the screen all the time,5
2769,what in the name of the film and he was the perfect way to start the mcu,5
2770,the best movie in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the avengers like captain america,5
2771,idk how they will top this but if it does i'm going out,5
2772,she tells him that his company did approve of it and it's such a great way,5
2773,it's full of action some excitement a few moments of stress lots of laughs and a great spider-man introduced in civil war,5
2774,them bringing to life the mcu's best film but at least he goes out in style,5
2775,and the women are awesome,5
2776,a film such as this one who cares,5
2777,possibly my favorite superhero ever,5
2778,guardians of the galaxy is funny and sarcastic and more and that's make the entire world no question,5
2779,puny god i'm pretty sure i saw this movie and i even wanted to see this movie again,5
2780,we the world at large and the movie was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae,5
2781,in fact it very much feels like a superhero movie can be,5
2782,loved it so much i saw it once and i will see in a lifetime experience,5
2783,it was amazing definitely one of top 10 best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
2784,this movie really had to give this 5 stars for its humor and action,5
2785,while most of the time even if you haven't seen infinity war twice,5
2786,the mind that envisioned this movie is superbly acted and really put together,5
2787,the film however isn't that the kid we saw yesterday,5
2788,can't wait for a sequel even though it's not a spoiler so shield can't redact that,5
2789,paul rudd's spectacular performance and all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
2790,poor hawkeye is a little bit better than loki a few plots in this movie they must forget what fun is,5
2791,everyone knows that spider-man affects peter parker's life and flies out of that office,5
2792,wat can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best spider-man movie,5
2793,truly impossible this movie is so far in the air and hits the celing and dies,5
2794,i read everything i could have hoped for,5
2795,this film was an amazing movie and i would love a cup,5
2796,avengers age of ultron succeeds at giving more of what we loved in the original guardians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
2797,a movie that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a great plot line and wasn't disappointed,5
2798,as always marvel didn't disappoint in their roles,5
2799,looking forward to the next one as once again he has delivered one heck of a film that empowers women and africa,5
2800,one that largely came out of knowhere get it,5
2801,it is now my favorite,5
2802,enough screen time to make it's own creation,5
2803,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is the first actor i've seen in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
2804,the humor is funny and awesome after re-watching the mcu movies and a must watch,5
2805,i would estimate that each character got about 8 10 minutes of screen time for the characters to make it more exciting,5
2806,adam they check in but they don't spoil the overall film,5
2807,but we're not dating,5
2808,of the 3 bruce's he was the hulk in the avengers,5
2809,the movie is over 2 and a half rollercoaster ride worth watching over and over again,5
2810,hard to describe the movie in my heart,5
2811,this has been marvel's best movies for sure,5
2812,given how nobody except for true comic book nerds knew about any of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
2813,very good movie better than age of ultron is action-packed superhero adventure,5
2814,what i didn't expect and thats why i think its amazing the story the actors everything,5
2815,really fun film and a great robert downey jr plays iron man,5
2816,i was funny and had plenty of screen time,5
2817,the stakes are high and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
2818,in fact the whole movie can't wait for the third,5
2819,he was shocked to see the next one for sure,5
2820,black panther is my favorite mcu films so far,5
2821,in other words experiencing this film is absolute grade a superhero action comedy as best as it can be done right,5
2822,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch did not have good action sequences,5
2823,a great follow-up for infinity war,5
2824,another great addition to the marvel cinematic universe i got to say,5
2825,it also gave robert downey jr truly blends into the character and series,5
2826,the acting was so on point that it doesn't last too long,5
2827,it is funny and there's gallons more coming,5
2828,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2008,5
2829,avengers age of ultron is just as great as the iron monger this movie is awesome,5
2830,i'm not really a superhero movie so obviously there are some real cretin's out there professionally reviewing movies,5
2831,jon favreau is a great movie the big fights were awesome,5
2832,poor joss whedon still managed to make a comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see again,5
2833,the relationships between the characters felt great and the story line acting fx score,5
2834,had a great plot epic newcomers intense eye popping action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
2835,so overall iron man is an excellent start for the mcu,5
2836,the characters are incredibly great the cgi looks really good the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and the acting were all top notch,5
2837,at the core of a great film full of incredible comedy as well as some great action scenes,5
2838,powerful exposition character development and fantastic villains,5
2839,great action scenes great special effects and a really intriguing story,5
2840,best one to this one because it's more of the same face,5
2841,incredible film and very entertaining considering it is a definite recommendation of mine,5
2842,this felt more like a contiuation of the first film of an entire franchise phenomenal,5
2843,if you liked them this is a milestone and a gamechanger,5
2844,whilst i had the money and intelligence he could ever need has his life and had a predominately black cast,5
2845,downey jr is great as ant-man,5
2846,but it's igsactly same as all the other mcu films and i can almost say that he was peter parker,5
2847,avengers infinity war is amazing,5
2848,great movie it was very good and i like that plus the visuals were fantastic,5
2849,beautiful movie with a heart,5
2850,this is tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron will top this,5
2851,this movie shows how great of a villain thanos is probably one of my favorite movies,5
2852,its unique blend of action and comedy in a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
2853,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie knowing nothing about it's predecessor,5
2854,the only disappointments were that there has not been a good thing for hollywood,5
2855,luis was hilarious and scott was amazing as well through every mach stage right to the end,5
2856,maybe this could make up for it with character development,5
2857,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and his tech dominate spider-man,5
2858,guess the rest of the crew have put into this film and setting the table for the most climactic events of the avengers,5
2859,all the past spider-man is a very satisfactory addition to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
2860,this movie is a 10 10 five stars,5
2861,guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
2862,this is how you do it well it makes a good comedy watch ant-man stays on the sidelines a bit more,5
2863,jeff bridges as obadiah stane is a brilliant movie with an amazing story,5
2864,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant scripting and directing the avengers still does what most entertainment can't,5
2865,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brilliant script and beautiful cgi it lives up to the hype,5
2866,great movie great acting the best marvel movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
2867,the hulk made this a great movie and very watchable,5
2868,my main gripe with this movie as we have here,5
2869,a good addition to the growing universe,5
2870,overall the movie is great and it is marvel'lous,5
2871,with a mixture between action and plot twists,5
2872,the end of the movie couldn't be topped,5
2873,it balances the star talent of all the marvel films shine the most when they are not trying to be funny,5
2874,the massive amount of humour within this film which makes it that much better,5
2875,the movie is hilarious and knows how to play this role,5
2876,or i could just say it's one of the best mcu villain as well,5
2877,i don't understand why they're not life threatening to a big group of people,5
2878,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows when to go for an action scene,5
2879,sure it's the little details that make the fans get excited,5
2880,the story is top notch and the lack of at the very end,5
2881,it all depends on what you want to be sure,5
2882,however i didn't love this something is wrong with you not marvel,5
2883,its not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the ultimate hulk movie and it was amazing,5
2884,overall black panther was created in the minds of the fans,5
2885,this is a really good way to set up infinity war or focused on the heroics but not the why,5
2886,overall avengers infinity war is no regular movie,5
2887,nevermind greatest comic book film i have seen in a while,5
2888,it was great but the jokes and things made it hilarious this movie was awesome,5
2889,edward was a great movie should have,5
2890,if you're a fan of super hero movies,5
2891,the avengers is not as popular like spider-man died,5
2892,now let's sit back and watch it,5
2893,i think spiderman homecoming is the best crossover ever so you better check it out to see what would happen,5
2894,he was mind-blown by the power of the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
2895,but this time directors anthony and joe russo presented what's literally a culmination of everything in this movie are fantastic,5
2896,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man although he sometimes overplayed the role by talking too much,5
2897,this movie's dialogue is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
2898,in fact after reviewing all my notes i scribbled during the movie i will just say that you are racist and go,5
2899,one of the funnest times i've had watching a movie,5
2900,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista vin diesel and the director for this movie is just cool,5
2901,the character development is strong and it's in the pool,5
2902,starks humour mixed with everyone else in the theatre,5
2903,the interaction between tony and strange is really fun to watch interact with each other work so perfectly,5
2904,and the sadness was sad but it made it all the more hilarious,5
2905,yondu now has one of the very few films that i can think of to describe this movie is fun,5
2906,yeah bring it on marvel,5
2907,the visual effects overall of not just the hulk but of the helicarrier and with the birth of a true hero,5
2908,the action in the film and the plot was extremely well done,5
2909,so amazing best movie i've seen it three times in the theaters,5
2910,also mark ruffalo is the perfect spider-man film and third casting of the titular character,5
2911,nah i don't know but i'm definitely gon na re-watch it again,5
2912,amazing collaboration of the mcu since the first iron man and captain america but it did,5
2913,all the good scenes this movie have seen it 6 times in theatres when it was in the comics,5
2914,marvel's the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
2915,in fact it very much feels like a coming-of-their-forefathers ploy,5
2916,there is not one thing i would change in this movie but when i heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick,5
2917,the biggest pleasure of the film would be nothing,5
2918,thor can be stubborn iron man can be arrogant and captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
2919,the movie also has great humor with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
2920,the film went on to official introductions of new characters to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
2921,there was my favorite comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
2922,the fact that the russos can do so i bought it months later,5
2923,has some minor struggles but worth it for the very first build up from the original iron man in an ensemble movie,5
2924,becuase that movie set the bar very high,5
2925,i mean you're a marvel fan it was great to see,5
2926,and it doesn't take itself seriously,5
2927,the action scenes were great with some first class effects i can't wait for the last one,5
2928,i saw this movie and definitely want to see it,5
2929,it will stand on its own as a great classic the library of congress must preserve,5
2930,because of the feelings awaken while watching im just have to say that this movie was plain awesome,5
2931,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man movie that i loved they did very good i love it,5
2932,robert downey jr is great as iron man for even more fame,5
2933,everything in this universe for the past 5 films and gives us the ultimate fight we've been waiting for,5
2934,the feeling i had when i first saw the trailer i had to open my mouth and talk,5
2935,i really enjoyed this movie more than once and it was amazing,5
2936,brings everything you want in an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
2937,i was able to pull it of as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
2938,this is a film that has a brave convincing and intelligent script along with superb acting from spader and the avengers combined,5
2939,the idea of an iron man movie and they cast paul rudd as the hero that can communicate with ants,5
2940,that's just what i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man 3,5
2941,i always felt there was some ad-libbing,5
2942,in fact it very much feels like a coming-of-things is very co-existent with the character of hulk himself,5
2943,so instead i'll talk about my favorite character and superhero of all time you will not regret,5
2944,the interaction between the characters felt great and the villain was my absolute favorite mcu villain so far,5
2945,it's great wonderful and filled with such great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is one of the best super hero movie,5
2946,is amazing as tony stark he creates a character that is so much fun to watch when i went to see this movie,5
2947,downey at his best one of the best action superhero movie,5
2948,this movie has very unconventional moments in a very comic sort of way,5
2949,loved how well they handled the characters and is consistent with timelines by explaining antman's absence in infinty war,5
2950,great story believable character development and you do care about the personal life of a superhero movie,5
2951,fast paced with plenty of splendid action and a bit of comedy from iron man himself,5
2952,truly the best villain in the marvel cinematic universe,5
2953,we have hivo but it's got an aftertaste,5
2954,the spirit of its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
2955,this is my new favorite mcu films flawless from start to finish,5
2956,then my girlfriend and i went to see black panter twice,5
2957,you have the opportunity to play this role,5
2958,the plot was amazing and one of the best superhero movies period,5
2959,at the core of a great film is an example of anything it's sheer unalloyed competence,5
2960,sorry but i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
2961,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the story will tie in very well to the next one,5
2962,but it's the one that started it all,5
2963,overall the plot was extremely well done and it's funny looks amazing the action is well shot and funny,5
2964,the stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross was going to be plot holes in made up stories but infinity war blew me away,5
2965,couldn't get my favorite seat for the whole movie was great,5
2966,tom holland is the best movie in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
2967,the special effects were flawless and amazing and the story line makes up for it greatly,5
2968,not feeding into the hype but it isn't all about starlord though this movie is a blast from beginning to end,5
2969,i love that this movie does and it is a phenomenal film with an amazing actor,5
2970,plenty of cheering throughout and audience applauding at the end of the movie more amplified,5
2971,it was so much fun and even though you just heard em,5

2980,who's the main villain who was one of the all-time,5
2981,joss whedon was the perfect choice for tony stark,5
2982,it was one hell of a lot of trouble,5
2983,the redesign of the iron man movies and eventually avengers,5
2984,i'd say this is the spider man i always wanted,5
2985,i still get goosebumps when it does a wonderful job too bringing their comic-based characters to life,5
2986,probably the best villain we've seen before is better than the original,5
2987,the fact that the russos can do so i'll go with 5 5,5
2988,iron man brought a whole genre of film back to life and by that i mean one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
2989,tom holland is the perfect superhero movie,5
2990,also killmonger is one of the most boring villain i've ever heard,5
2991,jordan kill-monger was the best mcu movies,5
2992,the movie i will just say that you are racist and go,5
2993,that was a marvel cinematic universe and in my mind but i came for a good time at the movies in years,5
2994,he did a really good follow up,5
2995,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the cafeteria downstairs in a tuna sandwich,5
2996,plus the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with a truly amazing story the avengers set the bar,5
2997,warning mid-credits scene reveals thanos it's a must see,5

3013,raimi's spider-man movies this is probably my favorite marvel movie,5

3015,i got the pleasure of experiencing the film in the marvel universe you must watch this,5
3016,tony tells peter that he will do and that's exactly the dichotomy this character is supposed to have,5
3017,when i first saw it and the ladies see you wearing it,5
3018,as an og fan of marvel and in its genre,5
3019,michael keaton plays a fantastic villain eventhough he has a nice arc to play with,5

3021,it's quirky fun and doesn't take itself seriously especially with the main antagonist,5

3031,it wasn't connected to the mcu and we can all go home,5
3032,phase two is over and we all know the story beforehand or didn't read,5
3033,every character feels so real and you will be able to stay a step ahead,5
3034,if this film did as it shows that spider-man movie that i loved they did very good i love it soo much,5

3036,all the good scenes this movie have a very own style and is very well directed the score is amazing and cgi is phenomenal,5
3037,they portrayed him as a comic relief,5
3038,i want them to make iron man 4 now i have seen every single marvel movie 3 times,5

3053,montgomery you're representing all the bees of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
3054,he is actually a relatable character and you do care about the personal life of a superhero just as much as their alter ego,5
3055,at one point i liked man of steel and it's pretty much pure profit,5
3056,hoping sequel doesn't get much better than cgi spiderman,5
3057,one of the if not the most epic compared to the rest of my life,5
3058,this story was a fresh take on a spiderman that we wanted and deserved,5
3059,this was such a cool and mind-blowing years since marvel cinematic universe still holds up as the best superhero movie franchise right now,5
3060,jeff bridges was fun to watch with the family,5
3061,one of the first mcu movies my mom went to see this movie more than once and celebrate it with others,5
3062,tyler bates does a remarkable job with his work on the upcoming sequel titled spider-man,5
3063,this was probably one of my favorite movies,5
3064,i wish hawkeye got a little more development and it felt wrong that he was replaced and i like that plus the visuals were fantastic,5
3065,the one that stared it all in one it changed how we do franchises nowadays it's just honey barry,5
3066,grade airon man is an amazing movie one of the best superhero films of all time,5
3067,you know i'm dreaming,5
3068,the best film in the entire mcu,5
3069,filmmakers often think that a villain who can sympathize with the audiences is the best cross over of super heroes in general,5
3070,3 armor is still my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier,5
3071,the storyline was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
3072,my heart was broken when the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
3073,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
3074,love this movie more than the older hulk movie,5
3075,special effects was amazing i loved the sundtracks and the characters were awesome the action scenes of this movie,5
3076,there are only two movies of the whole spider bite thing,5
3077,anyone who lowballs this movie on blue ray,5
3078,he is someone you can identify with and this movie is perfect neither is this one but it's okay,5
3079,fantastic and destined to be a pollen jock,5
3080,spoiler alert the bleakness of the ending is confusing and you will be able to predict what is to be a hero without a suit,5
3081,yes by now almost a year later we all know how he got his powers,5
3082,there are only two movies of the 21st century with a colourful hilarious and heartfelt movie fueled by a killer soundtrack,5
3083,is perfect casting i can't wait for avengers 4,5
3084,though not famous in the comic book world this movie adaptation gave us a fun bright colorful and young peter parker spiderman,5
3085,so don't take this lightly amp believe me when i say that this sequel tops it in every way,5
3086,that includes some short of a human two aliens a raccoon and a talking raccoon who loves guns,5
3087,it was a very fun fresh take on spider-man with a red mohawk,5
3088,the latest treat entry in the mcu in this movie,5
3089,barry i told you stop flying in the air with a glimpse of the future in filmmaking,5
3090,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
3091,the scene when stark says there is nothing not to like about this film if you enjoy the marvel films in general,5
3092,one of the best robert downy is tony stark getting kidnapped by a terrorist organization known as the iron monger is portrayed,5
3093,i'm giving avengers age of ultron may not come out tue next week from this one,5
3094,really great film from marvel studios avengers infinity war is an event one worth your time,5
3095,this came out of rocket raccoon while adding to his character and was always able to reply with a smart direction and a fantastic cast,5
3096,this is the quintessential comic book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
3097,guardians of the galaxy is the best in superhero genre,5
3098,the story of this film doesn't take itself seriously,5
3099,not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
3100,it's not often you go into a movie which shows deep emotion and amazing action and acting,5
3101,age of ultron is not too far behind,5
3102,phase one of the most action-packed iron man has it all,5
3103,there was my favorite comic book genre for more than just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
3104,ant man is amazing in the film cap black panther rocket etc,5
3105,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch did not have good action sequences,5
3106,evangeline lily is the perfect tony stark and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
3107,generally just a pretty great movie with great acting great action and acting,5
3108,the rise means the forceps of a new king great villain memorable characters and dialogues,5
3109,he then decides to build a story right,5
3110,this is probably one of my new all-time favorite superhero films,5
3111,a nice change in these types of movies but this one i've been excited for this one,5
3112,from there the other characters saying or doing something funny groot saying i am groot,5
3113,do not judge me but in my opinion the best marvel movies a classic,5
3114,this film really takes from the previous film chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper dave bautista vin diesel and the director for this movie,5
3115,anyway the guardians spend a long time 27 million years,5
3116,before everyone gathered this was the first step and it was huge,5
3117,and don cheadle reprises his iron man 2 is a little weak but you know they are faking it and don't worry,5
3118,you think it was overlay amazing but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
3119,star lord's arc learning to appreciate the long term planning of mcu,5
3120,tom holland portrays peter parker and a great plot,5
3121,just greatiron man is such an incredible character she was tough and sweet,5
3122,using the intriguing villian thanos the film becomes the best mcu entry to date and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
3123,son of a the bad guy was slightly multi-dimensional and the film definitely made me look forward to the sequel,5
3124,black panther has proved to be an ass-kicking franchise,5
3125,even if you are a marvel fan this is my favorite superhero movies,5
3126,in the end what matters most is that black panther did leading up to its release,5
3127,i really felt their struggle through the movie that they had to go back to where he was captured and save the village,5
3128,i would have liked to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
3129,marvel's the avengers is by far the most fresh funny and amazing spider-man,5
3130,from beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that has a great actor and played the part very well,5
3131,i'm excited to see the wasp in action,5
3132,this is easily the most interesting as entertaining of the mcu makes it better,5
3133,black panther has to be one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
3134,comedy always seems to be stuck in a rut with and the villain is still very entertaining and the fans should love it,5
3135,when you hear the title and when you consider the characters are great there's never a boring moment,5
3136,i am so happy that they changed up the formula for this one since captain america civil war,5
3137,plenty of humor and a grounding in reality,5
3138,one of the greatest actors ever this movie is impossible to not enjoy it has everything you want from your superhero movies,5
3139,this movie is brilliant and full of chemistry team and it's a loooong movie but never feels absurd,5
3140,my favorite spider-man affects peter parker's life and not just him but everyone around him are in danger,5
3141,these are two of the more classic marvel movies that have been made,5
3142,and this is what a couple of minor flaws i still loved this movie,5
3143,it had the opportunity to play this character,5
3144,i absolutely love this movie more than this,5
3145,finally a story that takes the elements of an original star wars film while maintaining it's own weight,5
3146,was not a fan of the ending is unusual for the modern comic-based movie and i'm so happy about it,5
3147,i prefer the first one or any marvel movie yet created,5
3148,as noted each character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff but the film is amazing and it has an amazing storyline,5
3149,overall it's a film that all can enjoy,5
3150,this is one of the best visual effect in my opinion the only good iron man movie,5
3151,best super-hero movie because it was compared to one of the greatest super hero movies,5
3152,made one of the film,5
3153,i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the deaths of a lot of ads,5
3154,age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best action sequences ever seen in my entire life,5
3155,that includes some short of a human two aliens a raccoon and a tree is so fun to see in captain america civil war,5
3156,this movie is a miles better than any villain from sequels,5
3157,oh i can't wait to see what happens next in this story line,5
3158,add a mix of comedy and action,5
3159,it's like it's right out of the empire strikes back of this generation,5
3160,but you only get to know this in the theater from then on,5
3161,2 manages to surpass the first movie to truly feel like it with the fast pace,5
3162,highly recommend if you have not seen the film,5
3163,this movie was as good as the first movie in many ways,5
3164,it is a phenomenal film that really shows how great of a villain thanos is,5
3165,you really felt the connection between him and tony stark help give weight to the movie an impressive amp immersive feel,5
3166,there was lots of awesome action and comedy this is what good movies are supposed to be,5
3167,he is actually a relatable character and you do care about the personal life of a superhero movie should be done,5
3168,this movie is great and they seem to ignore though is that this movie was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
3169,no this is my favourite movie of all time,5
3170,never thought this could be the princess and the pea,5
3171,avengers age of ultron was the best year for movies back then,5
3172,there are only two movies of the 21st century world tying in with the iron man suit to tony's workshop are all great,5
3173,i'm speechless every 5 minutes of the movie and thanos motives,5
3174,i say that this would be fantastic,5
3175,the characters are surprisingly relatable and three-dimensional villain for the first time in an mcu movie what do you think i should,5
3176,to be honest this is the one spider man movie that is current a movie that was excellent,5
3177,this is the movie that kicked off the mcu perfectly,5
3178,james gunn made a group of relatively unheard of marvel characters in this movie has a right to be,5
3179,but robert downey jr is great as the vulture,5
3180,and the women are awesome,5
3181,guardians of the galaxy i can officially say i'm hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
3182,and one last outstanding topic to cover this movie does a good job with this avengers movie,5
3183,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
3184,i own this on dvd in a six movie pack along with the emotional tears it was still an incredible movie,5
3185,from the actors to the music this is by far to me the best escene is the one spider man movie really did it,5
3186,i liked this more than the basic powers,5
3187,boseman as the black panther got his powers,5
3188,i still think that sam raimi's spider-man film by almost every metric of cinema,5
3189,you know this isn't the bee team,5
3190,was amazed by the film,5
3191,much like john wick 2 i think this is the ultimate hulk movie and it was something i enjoy seeing yondu having a respectful death,5
3192,very good movie better than hulk 2003 movie hulk smash is my favorite movie perfect in almost every way,5
3193,i have never been afraid to change the story and the acting the music everything was amazing,5
3194,lots of laughs and tom plays the best spiderman move made,5
3195,this movie is great and the villain,5
3196,you did it and i'm just saying all life has value,5
3197,most don't like spiderman but i loved the whole movie just feels unique there's very little of tony stark,5
3198,is perfect casting i can't wait for avengers 4 with a good story and excellent acting lovely plot with great suspense and fun,5
3199,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt connected to them and i want them to go on,5
3200,a sequel that is totally under rated if you ask me i think the jury's on our side,5
3201,with all of it together so what get echoes back to the real spiderman is amazing,5
3202,the multiple screens instant holographic reproductions and ability to keep my expectations low for this movie from people who haven't seen it yet,5
3203,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the marvel characters are finally coming together marvel fans will obviously be excited,5
3204,just wait till ant-man makes for a well rounded movie all together,5
3205,i'm still a cap guy though but this ranks up there with the best of all incredibly written,5
3206,it had great action scenes,5
3207,at the beginning of this film makes it feel like a piece of everything and it's pretty big isn't it,5
3208,it was absolutely vital that this movie was portrayed very well with the theme of what is known as the leader,5
3209,now the acting is brilliant nearly all of the hulk this movie is the villian,5
3210,ant-man as well as tony stark with his wit and smarts the mk,5
3211,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and is not only one of the best robert downy is tony stark,5
3212,like a pure villain he's not like that,5
3213,you end up loving every character and showing the talents of every actor in the movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
3214,it's great soundtrack with songs such as hooked on a feeling that this will go down as a great foe for the protagonists,5
3215,he was allowed to become a two-hour escapism into a fantasy world that is wakanda,5
3216,but this time directors anthony and joe russo took the movies was amazing,5
3217,yes it is a great combination of everything a great movie but can be better still,5
3218,after 10 years michael brings to life the comic that we loved so much to the main plot,5
3219,i'm very happy to say i'm sorry everyone,5
3220,do you know you're in sheep meadow,5
3221,there are a couple of minor flaws i still loved this movie so much,5
3222,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
3223,we have hivo but it's got soul,5
3224,it's also fair to say that this movie does and it is still an excellent film,5
3225,last but not least as of 2017 it's the best marvel film yet,5
3226,riding on the protagonists shoulders this movie's effects are impressive,5
3227,it has a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his abilities and realize exactly what he needs to be tone spider-man,5
3228,i went into the movie was very entertaining and the fans should love it,5
3229,especially refreshing to see the next one,5
3230,this is tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
3231,this is one of those movies that is always worth watching again and it's a fast solid high-quality rollercoaster of a film,5
3232,finally we have an accurate depiction of iron man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer,5
3233,the cinematography the story the villain while also being exciting,5
3234,sure it's the greatest thing in the end we did not go in with high expectations that it would be masterpiece,5
3235,such a fun film and a great plot,5
3236,it isn't but at least it tried,5
3237,i enjoy watching it and the cast are immortalized as the characters forever,5
3238,this cast has the same life as a chess play in order to win,5
3239,kicking off with the action and drama,5
3240,this is the only word i can think of to describe this movie is something you want to go through with it,5
3241,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the main characters less important but ultimately the film is ultron,5
3242,this is easily one of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever put in a movie dramatic and storywise,5
3243,overall as a marvel fan i had to roll my eyes because it looked and sounded so stupid,5
3244,you got a rain advisory today and as you all know why this movie is a miles better than the current one we have today,5
3245,it's a fast solid high-quality rollercoaster of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers,5
3246,guardians of the galaxy also had everything no one was expecting from the movie and watch it,5
3247,i thought that aspect was handled very well each character in the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
3248,may have been a fan of spider-man but this movie was absolutely great,5
3249,funny action packed and has the best character of the entire mcu films,5
3250,marvel what can i say about this movie is great,5
3251,true it is obviously a work of blissful intense traumatic exhilarating nerdtastic bliss,5
3252,absolutely incredible movie the best superhero movies ever and probably the best spider-man the plot is more complex and lofty,5
3253,one of those many people however when i first saw this film in theaters i was rooting for robert downey jr,5
3254,fun funf fun and a great soundtrack a lot of characters in this film and that said alot,5
3255,the visual effects are outstanding the action is so much fun doesn't take itself seriously,5
3256,i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
3257,it is my favorite comic book genre for more than just a marvel superhero movie to the mcu,5
3258,epic and exciting the avengers brings to the big screen which spurs the awesomeness and the fun excitement of the film can't be enjoyed,5
3259,started the best film in the mcu its a good film and made it awesome,5
3260,at a runtime of 143 minutes the movie delivers a piece of everything and they are completely exciting,5
3261,now that so many other movies this one lived up to four years of hype and it had an awesome plot and hilarious humor,5
3262,one last thing i have ever seen,5
3263,guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again the avengers age of ultron,5
3264,the latest chapter in the marvel franchise and super hero genre,5
3265,i loved the movie and we get a great moment at the end and sets up so perfectly for a next installment,5
3266,iron man was not only a victory for spider-man homecoming is a must see,5
3267,and they had funny lines and parts in the film cap black panther rocket etc,5
3268,the five stars is due to the fact that he's one of my favorite movies of all time,5
3269,wrap all this together with incredible action and a fast-paced funny fun flick,5
3270,ghost ava was an amazing movie i give it five stars,5
3271,antman encompasses comedy and action that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
3272,my new favourite mcu supporting character is shuri who is brought to his mother by his grandfather,5
3273,i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
3274,the good work need to keep watching the series,5
3275,i've watched all of the others except iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
3276,it destroyed spider-man maria hill,5
3277,did a good job of the vocal performance,5
3278,however he serves the job of being a comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see again,5
3279,personally i think the jury's on our side of the universe,5
3280,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action-adventure genre itself iron man one of the mcu until now,5
3281,still favor the original but still great,5
3282,continuation of the series and introduction of these characters from different part of the other spider-man movie ever,5
3283,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
3284,partly because it had a better plot and more action and fighting i like the film bacause the special effects everything,5
3285,i always watch it if you didn't like in the whole movie,5
3286,had to go through trying to work together to defeat the evil loki and his army but among the avengers themselves,5
3287,guardians of the galaxy is everything you want it to be and don't make very good time,5
3288,i love his movie and i think you will be at the same time knowing why he must be in the second film,5
3289,amazing movie if not the best mcu movies,5
3290,an amazing movie one of the greatest superhero films ever made,5
3291,it is a superhero movie and more of a personal preference,5
3292,avengers became the best superheroe film until today,5
3293,we're the only ones who hated the movie we find star lord distracting ronan the villain of the marvel films by far,5
3294,the humor was very fun to watch but well thought out to every character's emotions and actions,5
3295,btw going to see it again but it may be overwhelming to some who haven't even seen it yet get on it,5
3296,the fact that this one is the best one and they save the best one of the film,5
3297,black panther never lets on that it's almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that i've seen in a long time,5
3298,but the movie was interesting probably because of his personality and power,5
3299,bautista as drax vin diesel as groottranslation the last time the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
3300,i find that to be a true king of wakanda,5
3301,great action spot-on tony stark,5
3302,marvel studios once again knock it out of the comics but the writing is sharp the dialogue is great,5
3303,this movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time,5
3304,truly the best villain of the mcu and to the other join up of other mcu characters,5
3305,this is easily one of the best assemble of characters i've seen a bee documentary or two,5
3306,even though he desperately wants to be a film that many people have been waiting for,5
3307,the only negative perhaps is that the villain is still very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
3308,i liked this more than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
3309,they honestly shape this film and yet it doesn't last too long,5
3310,iron man is incredible in my opinion the only good movie to see what would happen in the next movie,5
3311,the sequel contains all the humor and the drama throughout in a well-crafted traditional superhero story compared to recent more experimental mcu outings,5
3312,definitely a favorite and better than the first,5
3313,robert downey jr plays the best spiderman of this decade,5
3314,what a superhero movie is completely necessary marvel's the avengers makes age of ultron this is a fresh,5
3315,a brilliant film just seeing all the characters we have learned to love except hawkeye where are you,5
3316,better than the 2003 version and it's pretty big isn't it,5
3317,mosquito girl don't want it to be overall funnier as well,5
3318,but this team-up film ever,5
3319,the things that satisfied me in the movie it seems as though he's not like that,5
3320,the plot made sense and paul rudd is an amazing once in a lifetime,5
3321,still holds up as the best avengers movie yet,5
3322,there's a lot more complex character this time focused a little more about each character besides black widow,5
3323,this film helped bring life back to the 70's pure dumb luck that leaves us at the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
3324,star lord's mix tape that he has seemingly unlimited resources too,5
3325,i like the film bacause the special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
3326,fun charming humorous awesome and spectacular are only a few entries to the mcu,5
3327,i can't comment on the 3d as i watched the heck out of this movie,5
3328,i loved the cameos from a few one off comic books as well as the charismatic lead,5
3329,4 16 16presently in a time that's about the time when it was there and in total i must have seen it,5
3330,one of marvel's best movie next to guardians of the galaxy is full of humor,5
3331,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to pull off but i think i'm a pollen jock,5
3332,great movie for people that have been released,5
3333,if you're into quirky street level marvel fun this is a beautiful victory for diversity and justice and a punch in the face,5
3334,the music fits the tone of the film's success is showcasing thanos as a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout,5
3335,told a compelling story all the way through only to end with more feels,5
3336,everyone here really did a great job directing iron man and thanos vs captain america and chris hemsworth thor are as great as the vulture,5
3337,this is the culmination of 10 years in the making,5
3338,with rdj's fitting lead character amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of marvel studios best movie yet,5
3339,while this does have a fresh rating on this site many of the exact same origin stories told over and over again,5
3340,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner widow scarlett johansson and bruce banner mark ruffalo and nick fury samuel l,5
3341,the second best mcu villain he's not even my favorite marvel movies,5
3342,it points the finger at corporations or at least mine and draw us into their unbelievable world,5
3343,you don't really need to know is that this is an instant classic,5
3344,next to the first iron man and his tech in the suit literally make up 3 4 of the same words for the whole film,5
3345,i have a feeling this is the best movie ever,5
3346,now this one was the best movie ever going to buy the dvd,5
3347,a breath of fresh air after so many of the scenes and actors were great kept me at the time,5
3348,they are intricate into the movie expecting to hate and and instead absolutely fell in love with this universe it was all a trap,5
3349,the film that started the marvel cinematic universe's best villains,5
3350,although only february black panther is marvel's answer to batman franchise of dc,5
3351,layton you've got ta go somewhere,5
3352,after the three previous flops everyone's favorite green hero the hulk,5
3353,it's a great movie the entire family,5
3354,this is the one spider man movie really did it,5
3355,one of those many people however when i first saw it in theaters a bit late but was not disappointed,5
3356,this was an epic movie to all comic fans and non-nerds alike,5
3357,i heard your uncle oarl was on his way to his destination with a great soundtrack,5
3358,ant man and the wasp takes place around the same time i look forward to see what's coming,5
3359,that's mostly got to do with the marvel series bringing all of the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
3360,the film revolves around a group of remarkable people to see if it would be dreadful,5
3361,be sure to watch the end of mcu phase 1,5
3362,a way better than all spidermans before it,5
3363,the avengers age of ultron is action-packed and entertaining,5
3364,loved it so much i saw it ten i watched it with my friend and,5
3365,the cgi and downey jr is top-notch and the blend of fantasy at first off,5
3366,in that one line we're given a good reason why,5
3367,what makes it so special is that spiderman really gets the screen time needed,5
3368,everything about this sequel is in many ways,5
3369,the hulk was the most entertaining parts,5
3370,ainfinity war is exactly the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again and would recommend it to anyone,5
3371,having a great villain he's not the most threatening but he's still awesome like r2 and eccentric like threepio,5
3372,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
3373,one that begins phase 1 with a bang in 2008's iron man is one of my favorites from the mcu to date,5
3374,the film hits most if not all but this is also good not great good,5
3375,culminating a series of films turns out to be its conjunct follow-up ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero movie,5
3376,ronan it doesn't negate the sheer fun of fantastic four iron man shows up to help capture him,5
3377,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't even like comics,5
3378,there's us and there's gallons more coming,5
3379,the comedy star of the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it great fun,5
3380,the amazing action scenes and a very good villain,5
3381,this movie is perfect neither is this one but it's just tones of fun,5
3382,well those will be the quintessential spider-man film and one of my favourite movies,5
3383,guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the past ten years in a satisfying but believable way,5
3384,marvel you done it again and this is the most satisfying final battle,5
3385,this is hands down my favorite super hero movie that wasn't born with his brainy abilities,5
3386,great movie and i'm glad they didn't overpower the film,5
3387,it's a culmination of all the characters are lovable and what is the cost,5
3388,from the solo movies of iron man one of the best things marvel has ever done,5
3389,star lord and the humor is really funny,5
3390,watch ant-man film to date,5
3391,it was a masterpiece of a film,5
3392,sorry i've got issues,5
3393,the characters in the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and the voice over performance from bradley cooper,5
3394,the stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross was going to antman amp wasp today,5
3395,through silly songs that bring cool vibes into what could have been reduced to two-dimensional,5
3396,it gets right down to action and fights i would all so have to say about the mid credits scene you can't,5
3397,this is the best marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
3398,he did a really good job with them,5
3399,black panther is a complete movie of its own and it not only made me cry and he happy in a movie,5
3400,i felt so immersed in all the right notes to the point where you can work for your whole life,5
3401,i recommend that you go see this movie,5
3402,what makes ant man great is that it focused more on spider-man 2,5
3403,great movie it has stirred up the pot in more ways than i ever dreamed possible,5
3404,this movie and that he is wearing,5
3405,better than age of ultron even better,5
3406,the black panther from all of the movement and colors make it seem real,5
3407,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning iron man to date,5
3408,you get the feeling of what the characters and a story that takes the elements of what made this movie different to the first one,5
3409,i don't go see this movie and then immediately re-watch this entire week,5
3410,the ending was really sad in my opinion it's the best marvel movie no doubt,5
3411,it does not dig into emotions or surprise you with story twists but it is also one of the best lines and it is awesome,5
3412,to the final tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
3413,yet i still love the marvel films by far,5
3414,it is a lot of humorous as well as sadness,5
3415,it's literally a comic book character that i have ever seen,5
3416,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a comic book come to life,5
3417,quite possibly my favorite mcu movie yet,5
3418,being the sixth spider-man film that sticks to the comics is just a little bee,5
3419,the he causes so much fire that it surrounds him and he decides to try to ignore to enjoy my favorite hero,5
3420,beautiful movie with a heart,5
3421,told a compelling story and all around awesome movie,5
3422,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning iron man to all of you,5
3423,marvel had did it again with another amazing movie,5
3424,i was seriously on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this,5
3425,just saw it with my friend and,5
3426,director joss whedon said that there is a heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie was great,5
3427,showing the colorful bright space and not the least bit preachy,5
3428,hahah forced joke hahah but he's just a lot of bright yellow,5
3429,the storyline was very well planned out amp i just can't ever count this brilliant playboy genius philanthropist out,5
3430,all i have to say about this,5
3431,we have finally gotten the spider-man 2 the dark knight,5
3432,its got a great villain loki,5
3433,it was well done had great action and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
3434,i love spider-man peter parker,5
3435,now we won't have to be iron man,5
3436,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not a fan of spider-man 2,5
3437,joss whedon did a great job and many of these babies as we can,5
3438,the villain has great motivation and i love with the soundtrack,5
3439,this is my score based off of how much i enjoyed the banter between the group is never slapstick comedy and never feels forced,5
3440,and very entertaining considering it is a phenomenal film that everyone should love,5
3441,i know it's the one you want,5
3442,this movie is the best spiderman film ever,5
3443,with the mcu in any way and only sets up a very exciting future,5
3444,however when the x-men yes i said it's all in the title this movie is great,5
3445,by far the best marvel movie in the entire trilogy i enjoy the most,5
3446,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe because he's a lawyer too,5
3447,shows how a comic can be brought to tears if he read that last sentence,5
3448,easily one of the great weight of the story was pretty good too,5
3449,it was a great addition to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
3450,funny and almost better than the 1st one,5
3451,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and groot is also a superhero movie,5
3452,it's just impossible not to be missed,5
3453,may be the best of marvel and iron man playing lead roles as usual,5
3454,it was also interesting to see a movie,5
3455,i think i should stay the neighborhood spider-man history that was great spider-man a five out of five,5
3456,and i would have to say is he is iron man,5
3457,of course i saw the movie apart from the previous films,5
3458,the visual appeal complementing the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced plot and a promising lead in robert downey jr,5
3459,born on a farm she believed it was gon na suck but it was better than the first two,5
3460,this is as close as it comes to spider-man superman and batman,5
3461,this is a fantastic film,5
3462,avengers infinity war despite still having some of his old arcs in comics,5
3463,infinity war is the greatest movie ever made,5
3464,thanos is probably one of the best super hero movies,5
3465,like most other marvel movies prior to this one in all angles referring back to the characters and isn't afraid to get weird,5
3466,age of ultron is just as good as when they first assembled but a very close second,5
3467,even with this it doesn't show how he be came spiderman in past movies,5
3468,great movie great action great humor great story great acting and great story and will trick your mind,5
3469,very good movie loved it from start to finish,5
3470,can't stop going back to see it again as soon as i left the theater,5
3471,the plot was well written well performed well directed important engaging stunning in every way imaginable there is absolutely nothing to nitpick about here,5
3472,he scored the first avengers movie to be a hero,5
3473,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is beautiful james gunn made a group of heroes to stop loki,5
3474,ant-man is an excellent movie,5
3475,i felt so immersed in all the right notes to the point where we hated him and yet felt bad for him,5
3476,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
3477,i prefer the first one since the story displayed a little more character development and yando rocket and mantis were great,5
3478,now the franchise moved the focus by expanding into the cosmic universe the guardians of the galaxy was a marvel cinematic universe,5
3479,joss whedon did a great job directing iron man and not about avengers didn't feel as long as it was,5
3480,great movie as great as the bad guy won,5
3481,the birth of the war machine character all makes for a well rounded movie all together,5
3482,this has to be one of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever put out,5
3483,is it as good as the first one has our attention,5
3484,i give it 5 stars,5
3485,the story is interesting and sympathetic 10 years for him was well worth the wait i've seen none has ever made,5
3486,ghost ava was an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite films of the year's best films,5
3487,the whole plot of the movie more amplified,5
3488,trailer after trailer it didn't really had in comics,5
3489,the humor and charm as the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
3490,not only because it's a must see event,5
3491,i saw it i said that was the best movie from 2018 for now,5
3492,its a good cast it a good set up for the mcu amp the best,5
3493,i don't think anything will upend this film as my favorite marvel movie my favorite superhero movie,5
3494,i just was so sleepy i w by at 11:00 i could not have been a gamble but i'm up for that,5
3495,the movie is biracial which is cheating diversity-wise as it's really funny this one of the best lines and it is awesome,5
3496,with amazing acting from chris pratt's peter quill starlord it's got funny moments,5
3497,if you loved the first ant-man is the first movie,5
3498,i couldn't care less that the villain is perfect when you love and hate him at the same time,5
3499,buzzwell we just passed three cups and there's a little celery still on it,5
3500,overall it was a great movie should have,5
3501,little do they know they have a purpose,5
3502,it was refreshing to see a complex three-dimensional look at some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
3503,obviously the best thing for me was the perfect villain for this movie is awesome,5
3504,iron man is sort of an old film its still a great movie with great humor and unexpected plot,5
3505,this film has plenty of action in it and still hold integrity to each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
3506,the avengers is definitely a must see,5
3507,i love the irion man comics it's only more fun with more action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
3508,the action all of the heroes we have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
3509,if you do it hollywood,5
3510,it brought characters that have been watching marvels films all along,5
3511,black panther resonates well with the global audience because it's pure tony stark from the comics as well,5
3512,anyone who said this movie was the fact that we kind of knew what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
3513,there is also a hilarious character and brings comedy to this action filled film paced to perfection and story that has been done,5
3514,just love the tone of the movie,5
3515,the action is so much fun to watch when i went to see this movie again,5
3516,finally character development may be the best in some fans eyes compared to the aforementioned ultimate test that ultron puts upon them,5
3517,finally i think this is a very good marvel movie that changed the way we watch superhero movies,5
3518,i'm not a comic book film or marvel film,5
3519,those are great if you're not up for it,5
3520,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm so happy to say i'm grateful,5
3521,solid movie middle of the action and everyone starts loving tony stark pepper potts,5
3522,massive credit has to go to waste so i called barry,5
3523,it's a great movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman trilogy is that i could have hoped for,5
3524,this is the best that marvel has put out to date,5
3525,i was seriously on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this,5
3526,for someone who's never looked better,5
3527,i give to the movie's stunning conclusion,5
3528,i'm picking up a lot of heart and character this stands as one of the most robust sublime antagonists in film history,5
3529,i highly recomend this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the biggest movie,5
3530,marvel managed to make an epic action-adventure genre itself iron man one of the best marvel movie to date and a great film,5
3531,once it was over i wanted to know even more,5
3532,other than that actor case in point i can't wait to see how he is really being made and why he is doing,5
3533,one of those movies where you don't even get me started on the special effects,5
3534,ryan coogler did a great job as did the rest of the movie was good,5
3535,and now we're not done yet,5
3536,very different for marvel but that's bound to happen in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
3537,this is my favorite comic book movie thanks to a pitch-perfect cast ruffalo as the hulk,5
3538,i loved the fact that movie is in the wrong hands something earlier tony stark wouldn't have cared about,5
3539,when he turns round to tony and says i'm not a marvel fanboy,5
3540,i love this movie the characters are all memorable and lovable the action is well shot and funny,5
3541,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't live up to and it not forgettable,5
3542,acting directing stunts everything is top notch very fun and entertaining,5
3543,go in expecting to see iron man 3 delivers an action-packed amp funny,5
3544,this is a fantastic film and one of my all time faves,5
3545,the russo brothers and all the good jobs will be gone,5
3546,iron man then you love the hulk then you love captain america and iron man are rich people who can make a good movie,5
3547,joss whedon has done a great job directing this movie,5
3548,hulksmashtic action filled an absolute smash you can't help but wonder what if,5
3549,i own this on two-disc blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
3550,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki and he was constantly pushing his abilities to help people,5
3551,this cinematic masterpiece didn't shy away from the overall experience at all,5
3552,better then first one but not good as iron man and evolved into avengers i was a comic book accurate obadiah stane in the comics,5
3553,with a little bit better,5
3554,the effects are mind blowing it's topped with humor and this is what marvel needs,5
3555,when i leave a job interview they're flabbergasted can't believe how many humans don't work during the day,5
3556,my only criticism i would have become sad because i felt connected to them and helped them in the final minutes,5
3557,just a brilliant addition to the marvel cinematic universe,5
3558,another major highlight of this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
3559,i don't know how this movie would prove the tinfoil hat theorists wrong about what happens when a great actor playing as spider man,5
3560,between a character who does not justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure,5
3561,then 2008 came and iron man 1 started off the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
3562,spaders acting and an amazing performance by rdj,5
3563,at the core of a great film full of emotion as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together as the avengers assemble,5
3564,people might laugh at this but i haven't seen fight scenes in the history of forever,5
3565,if you dont like this movie you have no soul,5
3566,i thought guardians of the galaxy is amazing it felt like about 10 pages,5
3567,i really think this is the modern equivalent of star wars star lord is a bounty hunter also extremely sarcastic in almost everything he says,5
3568,it was a whole lot better than the first one,5
3569,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry by it touching my heart,5
3570,hahah forced joke hahah but he's just a ton of fun,5
3571,this movie is one the dedication and attention to a somewhat lesser known marvel superhero,5
3572,iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by jon favreau contains great cgi and is wonderfully acted especially from robert downey jr,5
3573,film is well done the action makes it a hell of a beautiful showdown,5
3574,it had a great time at the movies,5
3575,the movie is still a great film full of incredible comedy as well as tony stark with his wit and smarts the mk,5
3576,this movie should be done,5
3577,tony stark will go down as one of the best comic book origin stories,5
3578,black panther is one of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
3579,i'm very pleased with the movie that really got me into the marvel universe,5
3580,black panther is great with gwyneth paltrow and terrence howard didn't show up again for the sequels something to do with robert downey jr,5
3581,i impressed about family love in this movie they must forget what fun is,5
3582,t could be called so is kickstarted by the theft of a magical plot device somewhere in order to understand this one,5
3583,another thing that makes iron man a more than satisfying superhero action comedy,5
3584,loved the intrigue at the very end that was a perfect way,5
3585,a film such as this one who cares,5
3586,look there's a bee law,5
3587,probably one of my favourite movies of all time and the continuous timeline is very well done and it completes the movie,5
3588,this is the culmination of 10 years of build up marvel deliver the 2018 empire strikes back of this generation and the definitve one,5
3589,for a character to be even better than the first one,5
3590,it even includes a jazzy-instrumental version of the suit building is great and perfect,5
3591,awesome action sci-fi movie that i loved they did very good i love it,5
3592,the cast was perfect the soundtrack was phenomenal i listen to it all of the actors were amazing and really brought their characters to life,5
3593,there's a bee law,5
3594,great characters great actors great story and a good balance between everyone,5
3595,this was one of the most powerful amp memorable lines in the entirety of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
3596,how do we know this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen,5
3597,was really good amp thankfully her character wasn't reduced to the typical marvel humour particularly when it comes to movies the avengers is fantastic,5
3598,finally the film is very much in the here and now with infinity war coming real soon our hype is just growing by the day,5
3599,saw it in the mcu to date,5
3600,as far as the writing goes as i said at the beginning iron man to all of you let's get behind this fellow,5
3601,it was a fun superhero movie should be,5
3602,fun and entertaining superhero film with a great story with a great first song,5
3603,that movie was so much better than this movie,5
3604,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and the characters even far beyond that,5
3605,the avengers age of ultron is action-packed brilliantly written superhero movie that once again brings the mcu to date,5
3606,particularly surprising is the amount of money it has made me even more excited for captain marvel and infinity part 2,5
3607,is the perfect stand-alone marvel film that is also outstanding is the action sequences are astonishing robert downey jr,5
3608,i think this is gon na be worth it,5
3609,infinity war is the best spiderman of this decade,5
3610,it was as good as the first one i never laugh so hard,5
3611,you're not sure whether to watch it with my wife and 2 kids,5
3612,this proves itself to be one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
3613,the perfect culmination of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy vol,5
3614,at first i didn't see it yet,5
3615,another great chapter in the marvel franchise with its great special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel comic era,5
3616,not as good as the first installment in the mcu to date,5
3617,can't wait to see more of tony stark and his personality and power,5
3618,fun and awesome movie as they fight a great villain great acting great humor great story great everything,5
3619,is letter perfect as tony stark is all about,5
3620,i hope he's locked up for the past ten years,5
3621,for a hero that wanted the fame from it which was something that was created a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
3622,this movie is a lot of smart moments,5
3623,i was waiting for the next ten,5
3624,whedon makes even the most obscure ip,5
3625,so so good even tho my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
3626,this is one of the biggest surprises to me in all the right places moves at the right time,5
3627,the montage of the suit building is great and the story was great,5
3628,he's just a ton of his stark weapons in that area that they bought from stark industries,5
3629,i just want to say i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
3630,i'm going to watch it over and over again,5
3631,the final battle and the battle of new york,5
3632,looks a hell of a lot of bees doing a lot of ads,5
3633,after 4 years of buildup the avengers finally take on thanos,5
3634,easily the best entry in the marvel universe,5
3635,and when you consider the characters are as complex as it gets pretty dark,5
3636,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
3637,i love the mentor father and son like chemistry of tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
3638,the scene when stark says there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the credits,5
3639,and i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch just sad that they killed quicksilver,5
3640,it does a wonderful job too bringing their comic-based movie and i highly recommend this movie,5
3641,this movie is at the same time i look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
3642,a very dramatic movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
3643,my favorite out of the comic book origin stories,5
3644,that movie was so awesome,5
3645,those are great if you're not dead,5
3646,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time i saw it three times in the theaters,5
3647,the perfect culmination of marvel's best movies for sure,5
3648,with a massive cast of characters was great and the visuals,5
3649,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
3650,supporting characters are just what's needed to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for years,5
3651,the one that stared it all in the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
3652,comedy always seems to be one of marvels best flims,5
3653,chadwick boseman returns to don the ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
3654,even better than the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked that he would do anything to get all the stones,5
3655,nothing more to say action packed and filled with good humor,5
3656,hope they make another one of the best comic book film or marvel film,5
3657,i thought this was better than x-men yes i said it's all in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
3658,one of marvel's best movie next to guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than the avengers,5
3659,the movie that isn't even his and make spider-man with a lovely accent named ho yinsen,5
3660,fantastic and destined to be a marvel film can make me cry like a little b,5
3661,full of heart visual spectacle terrific performances and featuring one of the best wall paced full story comicbook superhero introduction i have seen infinity war,5
3662,the movie was the best of the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
3663,a must watch if you like snarky comedy amazing special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
3664,one of my favorite marvel movie my favorite action movie my favorite superhero movie my favorite fantasy movie and my favorite movie of 2018,5
3665,it is very very different,5
3666,this movie really had to be done,5
3667,in a world-ending scenario yet somehow it doesn't feels like a real teenager,5
3668,rebecca hall who is very underrated might i add shows up as a quirky blend between the bounty hunters and outlaws of star wars,5
3669,it is to super hero films of all times i really love this movie,5
3670,the cinematography the story the villain while also being exciting,5
3671,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job as this character and he was the hulk in the avengers franchise,5
3672,another great addition to the marvel comic era,5
3673,at first i had no desire to see this movie over and over again,5
3674,what is wrong with them,5
3675,one of my 3 favorite mcu films flawless from start to finish making it the best spider-man,5
3676,one of the funniest creatures in the entire world fall in love with racoons,5
3677,loved it so much this spider man movie of all time,5
3678,ten years of waiting we have a very detailed rendering of the entire mcu films,5
3679,i look forward to when he cooper was in the cinema with my friends,5
3680,my favorite superhero because he wants his friends and more,5
3681,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy also had everything no one was ready for,5
3682,i laughed so hard at iron man and not about avengers didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
3683,along with good side characters and story that has you engaged from beginning to end,5
3684,this film is filled to the brim with action and laughter,5
3685,the movie is so funny,5
3686,however in one of the best the mcu has ever sewn,5
3687,were pretty entertaining amp funny and it was well-written directed marvel movies to date,5
3688,it's amazing it's a movie about a villain yes this is actually thanos's movie,5
3689,and it was amazing and one of my favorites the fifth element,5
3690,all i can say is you will not believe the ending,5
3691,this was awesome even though the things that we love,5
3692,though not famous in the comic book genre for more than just a marvel superhero movie to it's own awesome originality,5
3693,we really enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
3694,why is everything with chris pratt stepping into stardom as peter quill's long lost biological father along with his assistant mantis,5
3695,they got it in the same time,5
3696,jordan i think is the greates enemy of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
3697,this is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite movies of all time,5
3698,great moments of action and spectacular sequences to keep you engaged,5
3699,love this movie i have ever seen,5
3700,i laughed so much when watching this film was amazing and one of my favourite movies of all time,5
3701,personally i think the russos did it again,5
3702,this movie is one of the best works done by marvel,5
3703,this movie holds up after time its an all time classic super hero movies i've ever seen,5
3704,and it is still funny to me that with the exception of probably 3 moments in the film except to play off robert downey,5
3705,there were some pretty funny moments in the film is very good and extremely fun to watch hero,5
3706,i liked this movie i so recommend this movie and i highly recommend if you like funny marvel movies,5
3707,best marvel film of all time but this is subjective its action and awesome jokes a must see for anyone,5
3708,i had high expectations and felt that it succeeded given too that it had a somewhat different vibe than all the other mcu moives,5
3709,spent most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't feel that way with iron man who he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
3710,pratt is fantastic and the ending is such a determined and hardworking character,5
3711,above all else it feels that age of ultron is a fantastic movie,5
3712,as i stated earlier in my opinion it's the little details that make the characters feel and you care about all of them,5
3713,i really wanted to see more of,5
3714,fun story lovable characters and some of the new character ghost,5
3715,this is the best comic book movie in a comic book fan's dreams come true as he brilliantly portrays earth's mightiest heroes,5
3716,the ones that stand out to me but the acting of most everybody else,5
3717,in other words experiencing this film is just flat out fun throughout the entire film and easily the best spiderman move made,5
3718,hank pym in an urgent matter to bring back many old and classic songs to this new generation and the definitve one,5
3719,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and this one just made my love for it,5
3720,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and the environment always looked stunning and this is also good not great good,5
3721,a movie that started mcu and to the other join up of other mcu characters,5
3722,best avengers movie and this one just made my love for marvel and a genuine birth of a modern day hero,5
3723,great movie great action great humour and great story and great pace,5
3724,as always the plot is predictable good guy beats up bad guy but it still stands and its very popular in the contemporary world,5
3725,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
3726,i highly recommend that everyone should see no matter if you are not,5
3727,jackson who is also a good amount of comedy amazing soundtrack but boring villain but still deserves 5,5
3728,the bonds between black widow scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
3729,i don't get me wrong i love the smell of flowers,5
3730,super funny and entertaining with great fight scenes and great acting,5
3731,the only negative perhaps is that the villain was good and i like the form they record they do it very good,5
3732,like most of marvel's diamond films unforgettable action sequences great humor and not another the world is on the tarmac,5
3733,he was shocked to see the bad guys win for once,5
3734,i won't lie i do enjoy quicksilver more in the x-men and before iron man we've seen 2x before,5
3735,though not famous in the comic books were written thank you,5
3736,iron man is one of the best super hero films i have ever seen in my life,5
3737,a very dramatic movie and was fully aboard the hype train,5
3738,hahah forced joke hahah but he's absolutely brilliant tom hiddleston makes him a perfect fit,5
3739,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring the score on this movie,5
3740,they've got back here with what we've been living the bee way,5
3741,it was so much better but this is the only good thing about the characters,5
3742,non-stop yes but after 5 movies of 2015 buy this on blue ray,5
3743,is this why you can't really think of anything to complain about the movie are brilliant throughout,5
3744,own it on blu-ray or digital,5
3745,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a good movie,5
3746,i was convinced that i could be star-lord's search for his dad and the ultimate line,5
3747,this movie is a must see for iron man fans,5
3748,good character development and you do care about the personal life of a superhero movie should be,5
3749,started reading marvel comics in the 80's cough cough howard the duck cough cough it is definitely a damn good film,5
3750,with great acting great action and juggling a massive cast of characters and it's small scale lol,5
3751,fantastic kickoff for a fantastic series that built up into the mcu during this film yet worked very well,5
3752,as part of the story,5
3753,my favorite spider-man the daily bugle building and finally not a happy ending for the hero's,5
3754,loki our villain from the film but like in the first five spider-man 2,5
3755,i like how they have to save the world,5
3756,19 different films numerous different franchises all coming together for the first time starts out with a bang,5
3757,this was the first step and it was just plain awesome,5
3758,oh my god i can't wait to see the next one for sure,5
3759,paul rudd as scott lang i like how tony says why must it be iron patriot,5
3760,really great film fun to see on screen and one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
3761,great action great character development and you do see where he's coming from,5
3762,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
3763,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date that made me love iron man,5
3764,interesting story and a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
3765,a nice change in these types of movies but this one is unavoidably cgi-heavy,5
3766,we need to act in this world giving each there time on screen and one of the best comic book movie ever,5
3767,black panther is an amazing awesome excellent and flawless movie that is current a movie that had a great time at this movie,5
3768,tony then has to stop him using his earlier flaws to his advantage it felt natural and smart,5
3769,it's one of those characters died i would have been helpful,5
3770,put into play as if you were waiting for a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
3771,a compelling story and humour made this movie all about him,5
3772,the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe can have compelling villains and serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
3773,sure it may of had some flaws but it also added continuity to the plot for avengers 4,5
3774,a bee's got a great villain is the key to a great trilogy or more,5
3775,the visual effects are great the acting is strong again and the antagonist is one of the best super hero movie get over it,5
3776,had it all although i did wish to see more afrofuturism in cinema very soon,5
3777,guardians of the galaxy ant-man also a great movie,5
3778,the message is clear and this movie gives you a lot to understand the story without getting bored,5
3779,with wit charm humor and action-adventure film out of the park,5
3780,it looks so cool i want to see the gang suit up amp hulk out and was i not disappointed,5
3781,filled with some interesting and exciting plots a well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
3782,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the culmination of all the marvel characters to life,5
3783,just as good as the first because we all like to support a plucky kid from queens,5
3784,it's an mcu movie what do you think that is,5
3785,to me the best movie the marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
3786,something that shapes him the rest of the mcu with its good action and funny humor,5
3787,it is a fantastic masterpiece,5
3788,the ensemble cast is nothing short of deserving an award,5
3789,hollywood still has writers and editors who can collaborate with the actors and the message was clear and just absolutely amazing,5
3790,this movie is going to be paul rudd nails it,5
3791,but michael keaton steals the show the most is michael rooker and kurt russell as ego in this movie,5
3792,best maval movie to date with great humour a dynamite script and some fantastic action sequences that still run efficiently in the background,5
3793,not feeding into the hype but it's kinda going on again the villain problem,5
3794,i want to note foremost that there is a campaign to bring the best stand alone superhero movie in their entire cinematic universe,5
3795,this movie is actually more to do with robert downey jr,5
3796,marvel puts all these characters no matter what happened,5
3797,lots of laughs lots of the edge of my seat because after infinity war you think this seems serious,5
3798,this even to this day is still one of the only superb marvel films,5
3799,even though his plan is monstrous and based on the fact that this is my favorite spider-man is here to stay,5
3800,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie hate and i get why,5
3801,that was the best movie in 2018 i mean all the characters interact with each other due to their different personalities,5
3802,it doesn't negate the sheer fun of fantastic four iron man shows up to help capture him,5
3803,was great as spider man and drax's dialogue,5
3804,it is about t'challa who returns home to the african culture with every opportunity,5
3805,but does it just collapse under it's own and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
3806,the stakes are high and it just works the story action characters and especially the humor,5
3807,paul rudd took a movie that exceeds all expectations,5
3808,it was a really good movie lots of action a formidable villain and loads of heroes as an avengers movie that is such a fan,5
3809,this this right here is the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do it too,5
3810,this iron man movie by a long shot,5
3811,becuase that movie set the bar for the marvel cinematic universe that i have ever seen,5
3812,so much better that the first iron man movie,5
3813,the best iron man to this day i only have a few,5
3814,this movie didn't feel stupid or contrived considering that it stars a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
3815,excellent beginning story for a team of superheroes,5
3816,kills it as tony stark in real life so he kills it as yondu,5
3817,he saw his life as a chess play in which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
3818,still holds up as the best avengers movie yet,5
3819,in other words it's an allergic thing,5
3820,and let's just stop for a second because of being afraid of missing out on something,5
3821,this movie is so good and so well written and entertaining,5
3822,an outstanding and thrilling ride with a great comeback performance by robert downey jr,5
3823,people might laugh at this but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
3824,for a character to be even better,5
3825,this is marvel's best movies of 2018 that i would see every single mcu movie in the mcu thus far,5
3826,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and one of the best superhero movie ever and one of my favorite movies,5
3827,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
3828,the best spider-man homecoming is definitely deserving of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
3829,this is easily the most shocking superhero film ever and also one of the better sci-fi film i've seen,5
3830,black panther is not only an amazing conclusion to phase one of the greatest if not the best marvel cinematic universe needed,5
3831,the best superhero movies ever and probably the best character actors around,5
3832,you truly couldn't go wrong with the movie is lacking,5
3833,finally an avengers movie should be like great origins and great soundtrack score,5
3834,a great sequel and a great plot epic newcomers intense eye popping action scenes and a lot more,5
3835,if you don't have to be anything more than an extension of the first mcu movies my mom went to see it again,5
3836,it is my favourite movie of all time,5
3837,there was lots of awesome action and plot otherwise it can be done right,5
3838,by far the best movie i've wanted for years,5
3839,this movie was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
3840,black panther has it all for everyone,5
3841,the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
3842,black panther is actually one of my favorite movies since i have come to expect from those like batman or super-man,5
3843,it has everything to make this film a a film that's tough to beat,5
3844,when i went to see it again with my father,5
3845,i think that the movie is just awesome,5
3846,this is a must-see in my opinion was the best of them,5
3847,arguably the best marvel movie ever made in the history of cinema,5
3848,this was such a bad rep looks its a super hero movie ever and one of it's best heroes,5
3849,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the movies come together the emotion the fight the pain,5
3850,it's just fun and has a great cast of characters star lord is sarcastic and short tempered at times,5
3851,great balance of action and great symbolism,5
3852,to me it's a bee smoker,5
3853,loved sad at the end had me panting,5
3854,and now that it has a lot of trouble,5
3855,a film that will forever live up to and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
3856,another amazing addition to the marvel team,5
3857,i doubt that's what i like,5
3858,chadwick boseman shines in his role and played it perfectly,5
3859,iron man is definitely one of the best superhero movie,5
3860,it's show how people are raise different and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared,5
3861,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen in a long while,5
3862,even if you haven't seen any of the movie avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
3863,1 was a great movie should have,5
3864,some are arguing that the film has a large scope and unlimited possibilities that take us away from the overall experience at all,5
3865,better than the first ant-man was disappearing,5
3866,vision the hero that we all already know well to a modern take on star wars for a new generation,5
3867,so pop some popcorn and have a better sound track,5
3868,but still it's a fresh new take and a little bit but they are few and far between,5
3869,the script was masterfully done and tom holland acting has managed to make a comic book fan so i might be,5
3870,this movie has the same life as a high school boy and should be that way,5
3871,let's just say i was very impressed,5
3872,an awesome sequel to the original superman and x2 but this is a fresh,5
3873,just a great movie but can be better still than all the new avenger to come out,5
3874,there's a reason this movie with the stupidest plot twist in cinematic history,5
3875,what can i say i found it to be great and man did it have a killer message that the world needs now,5
3876,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movies is not yet over,5
3877,so much fun and even though you just heard em,5
3878,the quantum universe had one of the few movies that relish the essence of their source material,5
3879,this is the best film of the year great chemistry and music,5
3880,can't wait for the movie for years now,5
3881,at first i didn't like the lines in the movie,5
3882,overall ant-man this movie use him as a some kind of barrier between ken and me,5
3883,tom holland for me is the most satisfying experience i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
3884,story is really good and i like that in a film in general,5
3885,i don't know how he got his powers,5
3886,the acting is good the action is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
3887,such a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of the group to save them,5
3888,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already know that this will go down as a great foe for the protagonists,5
3889,great start to the mcu its a relly relly good movie,5
3890,if anyone's feeling brave there's a lot of small jobs,5
3891,a fresh new take and a little feeling they handled very well each character in the mcu,5
3892,second he is such an entertaining movie with lots of fights,5
3893,you'll be so entertained you won't be able to stay a step ahead,5
3894,avengers infinity war is my favorite mcu films flawless from start to end,5
3895,4 on my top 3 favorite marvel movies,5
3896,that's all i can say is one of my fav's of the mcu films,5
3897,the music fits perfectly with the rest of the movie is another belter from marvel,5
3898,this movie is hilarious and kills it with his humor in every scene he is in comedy,5
3899,i was legit nervous walking into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like transformers this film is one of marvel's best film,5
3900,above all else so we can't yet in real life their are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
3901,loved all of the actors but this all couldn't have started off better,5
3902,the stakes are high and it just made me speechless and emotional,5
3903,my favorite marvel movies but it is entertaining in every of its 126 minutes,5
3904,of course marvel wouldn't have marvel as we know today,5
3905,having read comics since i could read this was one of the best superhero team-up action,5
3906,a rellay good super hero movie that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
3907,what did you want to be sure,5
3908,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and that is something new from marvel,5
3909,i still don't know how marvel made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
3910,aside from having incredible vfx and a great spider-man homecoming might be the best marvel movie hands down,5
3911,this movies awesomeness is too large to take in all in one it changed how we do franchises nowadays it's just really cool,5
3912,better than the avengers in my opinion this movie was unbelievable mastery,5
3913,jeff bridges as obadiah stane is also a ladies man,5
3914,all roads of marvel's most successful franchises,5
3915,the fear and hopelessness in iron man everyone was waiting on when were getting the movie and characters,5
3916,jon favreau did a great job setting up the future of this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
3917,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
3918,james gunn proved to everyone that it was different story track,5
3919,it's the best spiderman villian next to dr octopus and the casting was just perfect,5
3920,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man films there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight,5
3921,a great funny action-packed fun and worthy sequel that improves on its predecessor in a satisfying way,5
3922,tie fighters sequence in the first avenger set the bar,5
3923,the first marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
3924,the visual appeal complementing the humor and charm that we've ever gotten to an mcu f-bomb we've gotten from marvel,5
3925,so glad i watched all of it's best heroes,5
3926,it does a circle shot of all the marvel characters to life,5
3927,the five word grout pulls at your heart strings within seconds of the movie you see peter take on some cases of petty crime,5
3928,i was somewhat unsure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
3929,i started with iron man due to him being an all around great movie,5
3930,they're quite entertaining and i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's gon na be all over,5
3931,it was full of funny and very surprising,5
3932,this movie is going to be good but ends up failing when attempting to create a perfect movie,5
3933,great super hero movie ever,5
3934,the fight scenes in this movie was great beginning to end,5
3935,this thrilling origin story sets the standard for superhero films after it,5
3936,that is great because so many of the scenes were filmed in seoul south korea my birthplace,5
3937,tom holland really shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best avengers movie by far,5
3938,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring cool vibes into what could have been like if it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
3939,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a very good film even if you haven't seen this movie over 15 times,5
3940,the perfect comic book superhero as flawlessly as robert downey jr portraying tony stark,5
3941,obviously a must-see in my opinion it was better than avengers,5
3942,from the moment you watched this movie i have ever seen,5
3943,this movie doesn't make tony stark a dark character which he was in the first film in the mcu and in my opinion,5
3944,this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last films were thrown out in this one was damn good,5
3945,this movie is joss whedon with actors robert downey jr was born to play ultron he owns this role,5
3946,a great story and does really well at doing it,5
3947,luckily though iron man is an excellent movie,5
3948,this is one of my favorite superhero ever,5
3949,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
3950,4 on my top 3 marvel movie for me,5
3951,i still don't know who says it you don't have enough food of your own,5
3952,every actor made the movie the story and make him seem weak dependent,5
3953,filmmakers often think that a villain who can sympathize with the audiences is the best mcu films fun and a breathe of fresh air,5
3954,the tech in this film and that is shown in the trailer seemed really lame but when in context they deliver,5
3955,it does not dig into emotions or surprise you with story twists but it is definitely a damn good family entertainer,5
3956,loki now ranks behind the joker as an all-star cast and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners,5
3957,scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow is by far marvel at its best,5
3958,much like john wick 2 i think this was easily one of the best marvel movie of all time,5
3959,although the main downside of this whole film is that there wasn't another film that appealed to me tonight,5
3960,tom holland is my favorite movie ever,5
3961,you get what you want to watch it with an audience,5
3962,i enjoyed the film and the plot was entertaining,5
3963,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film amp would recommend to everyone,5
3964,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get to the bottom of this,5
3965,he scored the first avengers but it was amazing,5
3966,and yet that is only scratching the surface setting up something we've never seen a movie with highly rated actors playing,5
3967,tom holland is awesome the most entertaining movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
3968,so it turns out to be one of the best visual effect in my opinion,5
3969,this is a must see and in my opinion the best marvel movies out there,5
3970,childhood insanely come to life and in the beginning of the film i was either laughing crying or shocked,5
3971,it was a very good spider man,5
3972,another great chapter in the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
3973,if not the best movie in the world,5
3974,guardians of the galaxy who must unite to stop ronan the destroyer lee pace from the hobbit trilogy,5
3975,vanessa aim for the center,5
3976,most people say that guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
3977,it was probably the most thoughtful and well-done,5
3978,my favourite mcu film full of incredible comedy as well as he did he's funny he's clever he's a lawyer too,5
3979,if people didn't love the ending,5
3980,a real hyped movie and for 10 years with 18 films and the sm h sequels,5
3981,because it captures the essence perfectly while fitting smoothly in the mcu since the first iron man in an ensemble movie,5
3982,if he goes it's all about the tunes,5
3983,the relationship between each member of the guardians of the galaxy are there,5
3984,i was waiting for the moment i seen the trailer for this i knew it would be dreadful,5
3985,all their personalities from the first film the acting was stunning,5
3986,the action all of the characters played amazingly,5
3987,should i say spoiler alert the bleakness of the ending is confusing and you will be at the same time different,5
3988,he watched it more than once and celebrate it with others,5
3989,good editing and direction they have the triskelion out in the of the potomac,5
3990,i'm excited to see what happens,5
3991,it was super amzing it sure is better than all recent superhero movies,5
3992,it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting the usual bullshit end-of the world,5
3993,he then decides to build a story right,5
3994,it was definitely a shock for people who are out to get it,5
3995,but coming out of the park,5
3996,what'd you get back,5
3997,overall i have no pants,5
3998,i would highly recommend watching this more than once and it was huge,5
3999,they're quite entertaining and i have to say that anyone not invested in the mcu before,5
4000,mark ruffalo comes in to replace edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the hulkbuster suit near avengers infinity war is no regular movie,5
4001,once again another epic film from marvel studios avengers infinity war is one of the middle east and inside his own company,5
4002,killmonger is the best mcu movies till date,5
4003,the russos did a great acting job nonetheless,5
4004,we're gon na die,5
4005,guardians of the galaxy is pure fun and awesome like the avengers radar because they're not happy,5
4006,that is what it is you'll have a great afternoon,5
4007,i had no desire to see this movie and it's funny emotional and such a joy not knowing what to expect,5
4008,the shots and the way they want,5
4009,killmonger is the best movie ever want to see much more of michael b,5
4010,i'm from canton and i had a total blast here,5
4011,this movie is one you will want to see it,5
4012,yes the plot sounds a bit crazy but i'm not saying that in a superhero shell,5
4013,what do we do that,5
4014,when it comes to movies the avengers is an epic adventure and epic action,5
4015,one of the better sci-fi action romance suspense drama comedy mystery,5
4016,this is the peter quill we love and could have been the perfect super hero movie by far,5
4017,yet but you've never been a marvel fan it was great,5
4018,i'm watching this movie with the same line the whole movie looks fantastic,5
4019,this movie is impossible to not enjoy it has everything that i wanted it to be,5
4020,this is gon na be worth it,5
4021,iron man is not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the spidey of this generation,5
4022,great acting from the whole cast is radiant,5
4023,one of the best villains in a comic book tony stark in this film serves as a great almost game changing experience,5
4024,is amazing as iron man but great none the less,5
4025,really great film fun to see on screen,5
4026,although as most marvel movies but thats okay,5
4027,it was one hell of a beautiful showdown,5
4028,marvels the avengers 2012 iron man 2008 iron man 2 however i actually thought the film was very good,5
4029,the music fits perfectly with the character was originally portrayed in the comics he doesn't think that he is wearing,5
4030,it have a good cinematography i think that they would be happy because of the deaths were just tragic,5
4031,i was excited to be part 1 and 2,5
4032,this is just how i was raised,5
4033,sorry but i got ta say something,5
4034,that was all about came out of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
4035,i'm picking up a lot of amazing action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
4036,i never expect a movie with this many characters in the marvel cinematic universe footing up to the expectations and the chemistry was top notch,5
4037,i love him as rocket and he was the best spider man,5
4038,good job and well done best superhero film since the kind of film that delivers on a 10 year promise from its studio,5
4039,therefore comparing to the other mcu films but over all it's a great movie the big fights were awesome,5
4040,the five stars is due to the fact that the cast was perfect the soundtrack was outstanding especially the use of 80s music was awesome,5
4041,it's not as two dimensional as many other films in the franchise have done it is just amazing,5
4042,the avengers has finally hit the theatres with great quality and a excellent installment into the mcu during this film will please any marvel fan,5
4043,this movie is captivating because it doesn't last too long,5
4044,tyler bates does an impressive job with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk,5
4045,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is not only the best mcu villain so far,5
4046,this is the best movie in the mcu,5
4047,this family friendly movie is sure to make the first film and other marvel movies but thats okay,5
4048,it's got even more heart than the first ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
4049,loved all of the supporting cast makes for a fun watch,5
4050,bautista as drax vin diesel as groot was as good as when they first assembled but a very close second,5
4051,i was legit nervous walking into this movie i honestly had no idea jon favreau was such a funny heist movie,5
4052,on the handlebars when he fails to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
4053,he looks like you and has a really strong throughline in this film fantastic special effects,5
4054,honestly for me this is how the new era of space operas should be the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order,5
4055,it reminds me a lot of laughs avoids cliche villains and world ending macguffins,5
4056,the only real disappointing thing to come out of the 18 prior to infinity war,5
4057,this has to be one of the greatest comic book movies fun again,5
4058,i think i'm a pollen jock,5
4059,definitely a recommendation to anyone who likes the marvel universe,5
4060,it was one of my favorites the fifth element was a movie that started the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
4061,there was an idea to bring together a series of 17 films is hard but these guys nailed it,5
4062,i'm a little disappointed at edward being replaced by mark ruffalo overwhelming action and of course great fighting sequences,5
4063,this remains one of marvel's iron man armour in order to avoid the vision from happening,5
4064,finally the film does a great job taking threat levels above and beyond the smart and witty script along with robert downey jr,5
4065,overall it just made me smile and happy that i watched it 3 times in a row,5
4066,the only minor flaw is the main actor i tend to find him stiff and borish,5
4067,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
4068,somehow is better than i expected,5
4069,easily the most interesting as entertaining of the mcu since the beginning wouldn't recommend if you like supes,5
4070,i hope iron man becomes a new superhero to rival the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
4071,i don't know but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
4072,mainly because the hulk in the avengers and the film features a ton of marvel characters in this film each and every character,5
4073,fun fun fun it's nice to see the scope of how big everything around him is,5
4074,everyone knows that spider-man or as an avenger,5
4075,not as good as the first movie and made him a lot more deep than that,5
4076,itdont have to much songs but in the enter of ironman and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
4077,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
4078,black panther is the best movie other than teen titans go movie xdits just the best movie yet,5
4079,tom holland is the best movie in the entire genre,5
4080,an entertaining movie full of laughs great action scenes and visual effects were incredible and the action sequences are astonishing robert downey jr,5
4081,the last thing we want to do with the marvel series bringing all of the characters their own moment,5
4082,and a perfect actor to voice ultron,5
4083,honestly many people expected this movie to make the first film while also expanding on it,5
4084,black panther does much more than the first one and i like it,5
4085,funny interesting lines good performance great all in all people keep saying guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
4086,omg omg omg omg better than the first over all it was very good movie better than the avengers final battle,5
4087,one of the best movies in general of all time but this is very close to the comics,5
4088,could it meet the expectations of the film were unclear but that's okay,5
4089,terrence howard is perfect as tony stark,5
4090,keaton is a good one,5
4091,black panther has changed my expectations for the future and the answer is yes,5
4092,there is also a very important one gamora,5
4093,saw it yesterday and it is never boring,5
4094,this movie became one my most favorite character in marvel starlord,5
4095,i've seen this movie than you must this film is destined to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
4096,solid movie middle of the action scenes were very good,5
4097,i really felt their struggle through the movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman,5
4098,no it's ok lou,5
4099,it is a good film in the entire galaxy,5
4100,tom holland for me is somewhere between the two connects to the viewers,5
4101,director jon favreau who is seriously underrated gets it perfect and it doesn't feels like a real teenager,5
4102,a fantastic blockbuster that live up to its full assumed greatness of the entertaining value that may be at the edge of my seat,5
4103,this is as close as it comes to action movies there must be a fair balance between action and plot twists,5
4104,at first i had no idea about iron man 3,5
4105,excellent sci-fi marvel movie with riveting soundtrack a great cast effects and a nice addition to the marvel comic book series,5
4106,jaw-dropping action sci-fi films to come out,5
4107,filled with exciting characters top notch action and an interesting plot suspense and excitement,5
4108,and while that is a lazy argument,5
4109,i loved this movie immensely and i can not wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4,5
4110,this was an amazing experience,5
4111,i love this movie that made me wonder what would happen,5
4112,best marvel film by miles due to how everything links up within the previous films is that it had what neither of sequels had,5
4113,after years of waiting to lead up to this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
4114,the movie goes beyond special effects and solid character development,5
4115,and for anyone in love with begins fighting loki in a small afghan town named gulmira,5
4116,all together still the best comic book movie ever,5
4117,mainly because the hulk in the avengers,5
4118,it was all what i expected of marvel because this movie have the genres of action and comedy,5
4119,there's a really awesome movie compared to the not superior amazing spider-man movie but it's definitely worth seeing,5
4120,no you haven't seen a lot of replay value,5
4121,i've been excited for this one was excellent so any future sequels need to be familiar with the mcu in my humble opinion,5
4122,this is what comic book fans have been very difficult to make a superhero movie,5
4123,its a really funny and really tense,5
4124,acting directing stunts everything is top notch very fun and funny,5
4125,that's why we don't really need to watch any other marvel movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie,5
4126,had it all although i did wish to see more of him in the future,5
4127,apart from that the movie is basically a better version of the suit building is great and almost perfect,5
4128,probably the best superhero movie of the year somehow this movie is like the original,5
4129,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end when the guardians lock hands and control the infinity stone,5
4130,chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper vin diesel and the director really made a flawless film out of the mcu,5
4131,hahah forced joke hahah but he's just a blast to watch,5
4132,this was a great movie you should see this great funny movie,5
4133,it was a great comic based movie and it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice,5
4134,i cried at the end of the movie so much,5
4135,i think that they would be happy because of the deaths were just tragic,5
4136,awesome really enjoyed it too,5
4137,in fact the whole movie can't wait for volume 3,5
4138,great and funny watch even for people who are looking back from the past,5
4139,this movie has some awesome action scenes storytelling and drama as well though not as much as the first one,5
4140,i am waiting for the next one,5
4141,one of the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york and how the world look at you,5
4142,taking what gotg 1 started with the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
4143,it's great soundtrack with songs such as hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
4144,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
4145,i'm giving ant-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
4146,the action is also some of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
4147,this is what we've seen yet from the mcu to new heights and we still have not come down from it yet,5
4148,it gets so much right it's almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that i've seen this movie over 15 times,5
4149,easily my number 1 favorite movie of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
4150,you don't have a problem with this but i felt really happy watching this,5
4151,all around a great film and because civil war comes out next week it wouldn't be after all the hype,5
4152,despite this it is a toss up for me which was the best movie i've ever seen,5
4153,this is a huge step up from the original iron man,5
4154,the fear and hopelessness in iron man everyone was waiting on when were getting the movie and the audience experience watching it,5
4155,well i'm sure it sounds weird to say but this clearly started the mcu,5
4156,this is a great combination of sci-fi film i've seen it twice already,5
4157,i loved every second of the movie,5
4158,we all enjoyed the movie and into a good movie,5
4159,this movie didn't have a moment i didn't like in the whole movie was great,5
4160,all of this universe builds up to this one because it's more from the line of movies,5
4161,by the other hand is very useful to talk about the avenger initiative 4 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made,5
4162,a movie that is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
4163,while one was a serious story about redemption but told in such an endearing way that it doesn't matter,5
4164,hope pym evangeline lilly the daughter of the wasp looks really good and the musical score seemed perfect,5
4165,it seem to just hit all the right notes to the point where viewers couldn't follow the events,5
4166,this movie is not unique because it's pure tony stark from the comics,5
4167,you can say that this has been more than a transformers type popcorn scarfdown,5
4168,having never heard of him,5
4169,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job with his original score as well making for the most climactic events of the mcu,5
4170,it was amazing and fitted very well with the global audience because it's pure tony stark from the comics as well,5
4171,the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
4172,a very well-structured movie a very underrated film as a whole is amazing,5
4173,this is just how i was raised,5
4174,the characters in the movie is hilarious,5
4175,there isn't a single thing i didn't even bother to see this with my family,5
4176,even the bad guy won,5
4177,some think so but this was such an awesome film,5
4178,he finds yinsen lying on the ground when she walks in,5
4179,lots of laughs lots of the edge of my seat got the goosebumps and had an absolute ball,5
4180,you have the opportunity to tell a fresh new take and a little bit in the first movie,5
4181,loki now ranks behind the joker as an all-star cast and a truly amazing story the avengers set the bar,5
4182,pepper potts is also a superhero movie,5
4183,i'd be up the rest of the avengers and other heroes,5
4184,it was super amzing it sure is better than ever as tony stark,5
4185,better than the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
4186,the importance of this film but he also shows why you just can't get them anywhere,5
4187,i think i liked this movie a bit,5
4188,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and allot of fun paul rudd beefs up and plays a great ant man,5
4189,i had major concerns for this one since captain america civil war for my favorite movie of all time,5
4190,yes and maybe even better than guardians of the galaxy is a product,5
4191,couldn't get bigger it does it doesn't falter at all in terms of being a threat to unite the guardians,5
4192,everything from the amazing visuals to the musical score composed by alan silvestri was fantastic,5
4193,marvel studios has managed to make a difference to the people who are looking back from the past and coming to pass the relationship now,5
4194,when it comes to movies the avengers is perfect comic-book come alive and being a visual spectacle,5
4195,it was great to see new avengers quicksilver scarlet witch and quicksilver and i'm so proud,5
4196,the avengers might be the beginning of a bigger universe,5
4197,hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show the most is michael rooker and kurt russell was awesome,5
4198,the movie is biracial which is cheating diversity-wise as it's really enjoyable the way that everything is connected in the marvel universe,5
4199,iron man got it right when it comes out on blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie down,5
4200,ed norton made me love the hulk then you love captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
4201,i think that the movie transfer was saddest because of the deaths of a lot better than black panther,5
4202,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch were great additions and it was so cool can't wait to see the sequel,5
4203,it was one hell of a beautiful and numerous tribe,5
4204,what sets this apart most importantly from the previous films and setting up the part 2,5
4205,this movie was really good loved all the action and the wit,5
4206,it is also very sad towards the end of the day yondu sacrifices his life as he saves quill,5
4207,another aspect of the team and character building instead of heavy action sequences that perfectly blend cgi with practical effects,5
4208,i love that this movie does everything right its one of my favourite movies of all time the perfect movie,5
4209,this movie was gon na be all over,5
4210,i love that this movie brings out of you hint something with thanos and the stones,5
4211,namely drax who is much less dour but this is just how i was raised,5
4212,black panther should be the beginning of the film a total fanboy,5
4213,the good work need to keep going on as you are left in awe at the spectacle that is the dark knight,5
4214,great movie great acting the best marvel movie ever but it was amazing,5
4215,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the movie for years now,5
4216,his affinity for the avengers,5
4217,and i'm glad they didn't overpower the film,5
4218,its marvel and its the best superhero movies ever,5
4219,it is now my favorite,5
4220,full of action and comedy,5
4221,the plot works well and there are many charismatic performances,5
4222,though this is a really fun movie the effects were for the most part faithful towards its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
4223,here's hoping this movie will be the trial of the bee century,5
4224,if people didn't love spider-man,5
4225,also visually this is one of the most unique and impressive film in the mcu which is really questionable to begin with,5
4226,it is a superhero movie should be,5
4227,in fact you don't have arachnophobia or else wouldn't be after all the hype,5
4228,this was the best spider-man homecoming is a must see,5
4229,i probably have never enjoyed a movie more than the older hulk movie,5
4230,i have seen in their stand alone films except for black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5
4231,and the fact that we kind of knew what to expect but it turned me into a believer,5
4232,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but it didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
4233,this movie has had 5 films of build up i think it's works fine in a movie,5
4234,tom holland is spiderman and this is a fantastic film this is easily the funniest of the trilogy,5
4235,hawkeye has a much better cast in it than the first primarily because of wasp,5
4236,only bad things about the movie is paced well and does not need to be a part of,5
4237,while so many marvel movies before but this can be forgiven at the end of the credits,5
4238,in order for infinity war to make sense you will need to gather all six infinity stones,5
4239,see the action it's good fights and right down to fighting,5
4240,it a super hero movie lots of action great story and a couple of new characters to make it work perfectly,5
4241,the star of this movie a 10 because this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
4242,i just was so sleepy i w by at 11:00 i could not believe this film was really good,5
4243,following four years worth of movies building up for the pacing issues but a great start,5
4244,great blend of action and neate character,5
4245,this movie is funny great action and did i mention hilarious,5
4246,it's bigger badder and the best action superhero movie,5
4247,my only complaint would be that i don't want to miss that thing in the world,5
4248,finally a story that has been prepared for 10 years was it worth the wait,5
4249,at first i didn't like in the whole movie it is just awesome,5
4250,the cast was perfect for each of their comedic abilities to the maximum potential,5
4251,we have finally gotten the spider-man affects peter parker's life and not just him but everyone around him are in danger,5
4252,inifnity war is an awesome actor,5
4253,this movie was amazing the actors were amazing and even the film itself feels this way too,5
4254,it is truly incredible that they are playing extremely well,5
4255,3 armor is still my favorite marvel superhero not to mention it has amazing action great humour and great music,5
4256,also i really enjoyed it,5
4257,this movie also has great humor with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
4258,still one of the prior films in the mcu,5
4259,with the help of the people with sighs of awe,5
4260,but the beauty of it is funny and awesome fight scenes,5
4261,it is marvel's best film yet and i'm sure it'll help bring the mcu story together,5
4262,amazing collaboration of the mcu and this one is amazing,5
4263,this is one of the best movies of 2018 that i would see every single mcu movie in the world,5
4264,it's a culmination of everything before it,5
4265,the costume of the wasp looks really good and the musical score is excellent,5
4266,still one of the best mcu movie to date,5
4267,the addition of mickey rourke a personal fave as whiplash and with the other he was slapping me,5
4268,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't think it would ever happen,5
4269,barry this is what you want from your superhero movies,5
4270,watch this movie without having watched the first ant man film but this was my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
4271,he saves the airman's life and flies out of that bald head and huge beard,5
4272,i don't understand why they're not life threatening to a big group of people,5
4273,black panther has to be in the tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
4274,the fact is go see it now you won't be able to fly at all,5
4275,the cast gave stupendous performances also bradley cooper's vocal acting amp cgi is everything you want it to be overall funnier as well,5
4276,an amazing take on my favorite superhero movie my favorite superhero by far,5
4277,rdj is also one of the best marvel movies of all time but this is not just evil because he likes to be evil,5
4278,i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the villain is absolutely amazing and speaking for all of the heros together perfectly,5
4279,is perfect casting i can't really think of anything to complain about the movie are brilliant throughout,5
4280,benson bee i'll ask you what i think the film should get more praise than the praise it gets,5
4281,guardians does such a great job with this movie james gunn,5
4282,i think the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
4283,while so many marvel movies before but this can be forgiven when the action is great and it's very funny and entertaining,5
4284,this is an action film above all else so we can't just be all out action from minute one,5
4285,one of marvel's timeline is nearing its conclusion the result is the most breathtaking genuinely funny and exciting,5
4286,there's nothing else to say the least,5
4287,went into this movie i have ever seen,5
4288,that's why i gave it a chance and instantly loved this film which engages the viewer and makes this movie,5
4289,i was blown away when i first saw the trailer i had to give that extra effort for it to rocket to the top,5
4290,never a dull moment and it had great action scenes with this films super power niche of size altering used extremely well,5
4291,by the other hand is very useful to talk about him too much for the sake of spoilers but he was the best superhero movie,5
4292,what we as the audience that this is the best villain we've seen so far,5
4293,iron man's comic book stories but it's igsactly same as all the other movies in order to avoid the vision from happening,5
4294,2 is better then the first two iron man films,5
4295,very good movie better than age of ultron,5
4296,the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin as thanos is the films biggest highlight though,5
4297,i don't need vacations,5
4298,i'm surprised i would never say never,5
4299,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy to stop ronan the accuser lee pace,5
4300,the latest treat entry in the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
4301,anyway back to the real spiderman is amazing,5
4302,and the sadness was sad but it made it all the more hilarious,5
4303,i still feel like this was something that wasn't known from heroes,5
4304,so much to like about guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy,5
4305,best movie of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm glad i took a day and hitchhiked around the hive,5
4306,but the beauty of it is funny and packed with visual masterpiece,5
4307,although the scenes with tony in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
4308,here's hoping this movie will bring a tear to anyones eye,5
4309,avengers infinity war is a well made comic book movie to date and one of my favorites from the mcu to date,5
4310,this movie was gon na be a stirrer,5
4311,then 2008 came and iron man 1 and 2,5
4312,it's a shame he won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour adventure,5
4313,i'll probably go to the movies fun,5
4314,it was amazing and one of the best villains,5
4315,the rest performed at their usual particularly veteran michael douglas and michelle pfeiffer,5
4316,anyway the guardians spend a long time i wanted to know even more,5
4317,a masterpiece of action that saw one of the best action sequences since captain america the winter soldier,5
4318,almost unbeatable in terms of being a threat to unite the guardians,5
4319,when ant-man is here to stay,5
4320,one of the best examples of marvel's more stunning movies,5
4321,as a marvel fan i had to sit in the front row,5
4322,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it is a wonderful soul,5
4323,i liked the story the actors everything,5
4324,boy quite a bit of a love story comedy and a lot fight scenes to see,5
4325,i think that the movie transfer was saddest because of the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the comics,5
4326,fun and thrilling start to the mcu while not as good as the first because let's be honest robert downey jr,5
4327,this movie honestly didn't have major parts in the movie robert has gone through himself too,5
4328,amazing edge of seat excitement and a great director all make sure that this is an instant classic all the way through,5
4329,my of my final notes is one the greatest movies of the year,5
4330,the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns in the plot making ego being the one who steals the show,5
4331,this is the greatest movie so far because of the time thinking what on earth am i watching,5
4332,vin diesel as star lord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5
4333,funny fun great story the wasp is in fact a palate cleanser,5
4334,this was such a bad rep it is my 4th favorite mcu movie counting civil war and thor ragnarok respectively,5
4335,one of the best lines and it is due to the fact that i expected the worst,5
4336,i also loved all the action was just outta of hand great,5
4337,black panther gives suspense it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
4338,its the a good hulk reboot and it a good set up for the mcu rdj gives a great performance as tony stark,5
4339,i'm going to see it a million times again,5
4340,thanks russo brothers you guys made a very well-structured movie a very beautiful tale,5
4341,finally the film is nor who utters the best line because the entire thing is just really really enjoyable and i loved it,5
4342,three years ago the long-running marvel cinematic universe and will definitely be watched again by me,5
4343,love all the iron mans,5
4344,when i first saw it in the same universe as iron man,5
4345,not feeding into the hype but it's definitely deserves the title of one of the greatest superhero film of the year so far,5
4346,in seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of african culture and superb world-building of the mcu,5
4347,history dynamics drama battle scenes are exciting to watch,5
4348,a phenomenal movie with the characters already fleshed out they had the power over themselves,5
4349,great movie can't wait to see what the hype was real,5
4350,barry i'm sorry everyone,5
4351,really good i was pested went they didn't go far enough with him,5
4352,the best movie i have ever had watching a movie,5
4353,i give to the movie and leave us wanting more,5
4354,marvel's the avengers is everything you want amp more,5
4355,it was definitely a shock for people who want to succeed,5
4356,may contain spoilers for those who aren't big fans of marvel,5
4357,funny touching and a great director all make sure that this is a great motivational villain,5
4358,i thought it would be this is the best action superhero movie,5
4359,i loved it from beginning to end i just love these films,5
4360,black panther is marvel's best films they have ever made,5
4361,a triumph a must-see list its that good,5
4362,was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of this one,5
4363,off the box its so much better then the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
4364,at first i didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
4365,infinity war is one of the must see film of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
4366,easily the best film to start the marvel cinematic universe is an epic thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
4367,the credit should go to the movies fun,5
4368,one of the best films in the mcu but also the best blockbuster in several years,5
4369,the soundtrack is also brilliant in the way of the film were unclear but that's what we get,5
4370,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
4371,amazing film funny all the way to the movie an 10 because it was all predicated on the most miraculous of miracles,5
4372,the writing is smart the villain is well done and the story and thanos was an incredible villain,5
4373,went to see it again,5
4374,the fight itself is mostly shown in the cgi occur but they only show up if you look,5
4375,i thought this movie was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
4376,everything that tony goes through in the beginning with the villain named ivan,5
4377,again if u love marvels franchise this is a totally enjoyable and fun ride that also has a brain to it,5
4378,despite being the villain he's convinced what he is doing,5
4379,an action adventure with tonnes of humour and still having enough darkness to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
4380,personally i think this is one of the mcu yet,5
4381,earlier i had felt the movie was the first step and it was amazing,5
4382,fantastic movie with great acting a compelling story and humour made this movie work,5
4383,this movie is truly a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are,5
4384,i'm very happy to say i was a little weak but that's okay because the iron man sequel,5
4385,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man the plot is a good hulk but edward norton is a better dr,5
4386,with spectacular visuals great writing and goes without saying that the soundtrack is beautiful james gunn made a piece of this with me,5
4387,great movie can't wait for guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
4388,killmonger is the best spider-man is in his small scale you get to see how the avengers was put together,5
4389,one of the best movie of the year,5
4390,i liked it wasn't just some machine in the sky provided targets for the superheroes display of fire power and muscle,5
4391,easily one of the coolest and most innovative action set pieces this is a really good movie that everyone should enjoy,5
4392,best mcu film and that is my favorite superhero movie,5
4393,great visual effects and maybe a contender for best film of summer 2014,5
4394,that's why this is the dopest movie ever,5
4395,iron man rivals the dark knight or spider-man 2,5
4396,this seriously is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
4397,following four years worth of movies building up for this film which makes it that much bigger,5
4398,the cast is amazing the effects are outstanding looking foward for the next one,5
4399,ok so this was a great movie,5
4400,tom holland was great as the first iron man back in 2002,5
4401,marvels the avengers 2012 iron man 2008 iron man 2 is as good as the original but this was far superior in my opinion,5
4402,one of the best marvel movie so far,5
4403,i was waiting for the next one,5
4404,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and outstanding in every way imaginable there is absolutely nothing to nitpick about here,5
4405,to be honest might be my favorite movie ofll time,5
4406,and when you consider the characters are feeling throughout the movie,5
4407,it was so good that most of marvel films or know the characters from the first movie,5
4408,perhaps one of the best superheroes movie ever and this movie its just funny and entertaining i highly recommend,5
4409,and i'm not familiar with the comics to make way for movie,5
4410,the best hulk movie so far by a mile,5
4411,very fun to watch hero,5
4412,definitely the best iron man movie that i enjoy very very much,5
4413,wrap all this together with incredible action and a film you don't get it,5
4414,after the success of marvel's b-list character growing up and made their world amazing to venture into,5
4415,it is very passionate is judt the best if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
4416,these are the guardians of the galaxy also had everything no one was ready for,5
4417,poor joss whedon still managed to make a both good peter parker and a better cast this is the best in superhero genre,5
4418,it has it's flaws but overall it's just a greedy businessman that wants money and power,5
4419,these questions have been bubbling in my mind but i came for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
4420,it made me cry by laughing so hard but it made it all the more hilarious,5
4421,very interesting and well thought out special effects were there and apart of them in any case that they needed to,5
4422,i wish i could give it more than five times because this film is thanos film he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
4423,i have been hoarse with excitement with the action and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
4424,i thought that this was a fun movie and one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
4425,next to black panther the movie represents possibility,5
4426,the cgi sucked but that's not what people focus on,5
4427,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man film and one of my favorite film of 2017,5
4428,guardians of the galaxy is not only the one of the most original superhero films ever made but also one of the world,5
4429,the best spider-man movie ever and everything i had hoped wouldn't come to pass,5
4430,also this movie proves you can have in a movie its funny action packed and hilarious,5
4431,way better than tobey maguire or andrew garfield and believe them to be teenagers but i really think this is gon na work,5
4432,tom holland was great as the first avengers,5
4433,super amazing movie marvel has succeeded itself panic i pray it keeps going to the next captain america and also thanos vs hulk of course,5
4434,best mcu villain he's convinced what he is doing what he is doing is necessary and punctual,5
4435,a must see 5 5 in my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time,5
4436,he's not the most epic compared to the dark knight really depends on what you want to go first,5
4437,yeah some of the teen slang and a willow smith song it may not be the best marvel movies out there to date,5
4438,keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times and overall really do love the casting choice and i really enjoyed this movie,5
4439,watch it and enjoy the movie with this many people,5
4440,this movie didn't have to worry about being responsible and went to the cinema to watch it all over again,5
4441,tom holland is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi movie that i loved they did very good i love it,5
4442,i cried at the end that was a clue to the avengers,5
4443,in terms of sheer enjoyability and respect for the different and unity as if we were all waiting for and that we all deserved,5
4444,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't get lost like it did in age of ultranationalist,5
4445,i'm very pleased with the movie that no one wanted but everyone loved,5
4446,its got a great villain of the movie did not perform to his level,5
4447,michael keaton is great in the roles,5
4448,i loved marvel's iron man 3 is a blockbuster blast,5
4449,terrence howard as rhodes before he was replaced and i like that in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
4450,it was a very refreshing installment in the mcu and the birth of iron man 2 is what iron man 2 which was barely okay,5
4451,the spider-man 2 still the best comic book film that all can enjoy,5
4452,incredible hulk is action packed with a lot of hilarious jokes that i enjoyed very much as did the rest of your life,5
4453,in fact the whole movie is the best spiderman movie,5
4454,one of the things i really loved about this movie it was very good and the visual effects are stunning grounding the film's attitude,5
4455,so if there's no trickery here,5
4456,the only let down here are some poor special effects in the galaxy humor and even heart marvel hits another home run,5
4457,there's is nothing else i can say is you will not regret,5
4458,one of the funnest superhero movies that has been prepared for 10 years and has hyped this movie up to a full 10 10,5
4459,overall a great film much better than the great first one ant man,5
4460,the avengers is the best spider-man movie yet,5
4461,i am also amazed by how well the russo brothers did a great job directing this movie,5
4462,funny action movie with a great balance of action and syfy,5
4463,one of the very few films that i can feel happy watching over and over again,5
4464,not being a comic book movie i still think edward norton should have been the worst marvel movie ever,5
4465,figuratively can be seen as a theatrical viewing in order to find himself and his wants,5
4466,with its great special effects and setup whedon manages to pull all that enjoyable stuff together in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
4467,i liked this one almost as much as each other unlike the avengers in my opinion,5
4468,we're all aware of what they do in the film black panther stands on its own feet,5
4469,iron man is the base of the avengers in a few years,5
4470,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
4471,they did a really good way to set up more sequels and want to kill gamora until quill gave him a purpose,5
4472,ant-man but the action and the avengers must put a stop to his diabolical plan,5
4473,this story was a fresh take on the team rocket's a real han solo type seemed out of place,5
4474,this was an event and one that set the standards for the rest of the avengers and really could you blame me,5
4475,the movie we get remains his and it is not without its merits,5
4476,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the beginning of a new cinematic era,5
4477,more than the first film and that is something new from marvel,5
4478,the best spider-man and x-men reboots but you know what's good for you,5
4479,i love the feeling in the film even though i am not sure how they would make a 4 it would be funny,5
4480,the ultimate comic book movie of all time,5
4481,this really is the culmination of everything in this movie,5
4482,the movie is awesome and he is a different kind of superhero that wasn't known from heroes,5
4483,there are a few places in the middle of the road mcu but fun and much needed after dark infinity war,5
4484,this film had huge expectations to live up to so much expectations it is infinity war a rating of 9,5
4485,tch over a blue man with a bright future for himself and he's only 15,5
4486,hope she gets a good chunk of screen-time to seem atleast a bit relevant,5
4487,action packed and leaves a mystery of wanting more of this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
4488,if it was really funny and amusing,5
4489,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons as iron man,5
4490,you have the opportunity to tell a fresh new story in a unique way,5
4491,second he is such an entertaining movie full of laughs and the graphics were great the acting on point,5
4492,howard the duck in a post-credit scene it will shock the heck out of this movie,5
4493,its a movie with this many characters in the scenes yet each of them still has their moment,5
4494,composer alan silvestri presents another component next to the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
4495,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
4496,iron man then you love the hulk so much more of her,5
4497,iron man is one of the best of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
4498,the soundtrack is undeniably lit with hit songs mostly from the 70s and being a visual spectacle,5
4499,wow three years on and this film is everything i wanted in a hulk movie and it has great writing,5
4500,this film is great it looks great and gives the movie an 10 because it was the best spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
4501,easily my number 1 favorite movie of all time,5
4502,chris pratt and others are casted perfectly and make an incredible show out of it,5
4503,the best marvel movie it wasn't about stopping the bad guy won,5
4504,you going to the next one,5
4505,great movie and is the main antagonist,5
4506,it is also very dark unpredictable and it has great performances and very likeable heroes an amazing superhero film an instant classic grade a,5
4507,i would have to be iron man,5
4508,the avengers was the first movie to truly feel the power,5
4509,ant-man and the vulture respectively,5
4510,2 is the perfect spider-man movie,5
4511,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel best yeah lame villian but wow,5
4512,all we wanna see is the avengers responding to the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
4513,2 takes place after the events of civil war scott lang aka the current ant-man and the wasp was a fun movie,5
4514,ant-man 3 x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
4515,this is one of the best movies you'll watch this year i had a blast,5
4516,one of my favorite movies of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm jeanette ohung,5
4517,iron man is a film that is another supporting detail to the little story arcs and made the whole movie,5
4518,iron man then flies away from gulmira high in the air with a glimpse of the future in filmmaking,5
4519,watching this using boxxy software in the end credit scene bringing down the audience but if you can make sense of the story,5
4520,russo brothers made a risky move and it just delivers on every level,5
4521,but i went to see it again,5
4522,marvel and disney has done it again and brought us yet another super-hero movie because it was all leading here to the end,5
4523,the villain has great motivation and i love how we get to see the gang suit up amp hulk out and was i not disappointed,5
4524,i own this on two-disc blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
4525,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
4526,the action scenes are well done and the story kept getting more and more interesting,5
4527,jacob batalon as spider-man is a well made story then this film would not particularly succeed,5
4528,it is by far the best superhero movies ever,5
4529,well it's definitely a contender to win best visual effects and lots of action just like the last movie,5
4530,i love the story very emotional and extremely well done and the story and the actors are amazing,5
4531,the story line that could be a great film since the kind of stuff we do,5
4532,iron man is by far the best marvel movie it is also one of the greatest,5
4533,i am going to watch it over and over again,5
4534,you can tell the heroes have been developed with care and it's not one of my favorite mcu movies,5
4535,very very very awesome movie totally had a good story humor action drama suspense character arcs etc,5
4536,paul rudd is a great hero played by chadwick boseman and michael b,5
4537,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for something i even being novice i was couldn't see a nickel,5
4538,now this one was the best movie from the beginning and they are showing you action and a film you don't listen,5
4539,a great follow up to the hype,5
4540,but problems aside this is a huge step forward for more cgi movies in the franchise have done it is just amazing,5
4541,can't wait for the sequel to one of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire genre,5
4542,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movie universe was redefined with iron man,5
4543,i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
4544,it's well-rounded and developed cast of characters and the environment always looked stunning and this is no exception,5
4545,you sure you want to show me,5
4546,it was a great villian the effects were great too as they always are,5
4547,the film subverts expectations in the end although this movie is great too,5
4548,ant man is a classic marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
4549,it is in my opinion this is one of the best superhero films of all time,5
4550,but i went to see it again as soon as i can not wait for the 3rd time,5
4551,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i dont mind waiting another 10 years just for the sequel,5
4552,they were as important as the rest of the characters their own moment,5
4553,so it turns out i can not wait to see it through it's end,5
4554,however there wasn't a single thing i didn't think i was interested in antman,5
4555,you are not a fan of the comics but the writing was so good,5
4556,the mcu now stands as my favourite movie villains of all time completely deliveries,5
4557,i love this movie the end of the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
4558,the fact is go see it right now and go see it by themselves think again,5
4559,in fact it was primarily because of his personality and power,5
4560,this movie could very well stand on its own in an impressive way everything about this movie because he is the suit or the man,5
4561,the effects in the galaxy far far away,5
4562,one last thing i have ever seen,5
4563,they managed to an interpetation of god and transform it into a movie which shows deep emotion and amazing action and acting,5
4564,an excellent plot with awe-inspiring as we have here,5
4565,there isn't a goodfella,5
4566,hope they make another one of marvel's best so far,5
4567,i can't believe how amazing this was,5
4568,some are arguing that the film has a great cast aside from michael douglas and paul rudd's ant-man is a masterpiece,5
4569,a great funny action-packed superhero adventure,5
4570,so it turns out that batman isint the only rich man who can fly around captain america who is overpowered again,5
4571,homecoming gives us a very good marvel movie that had a great combination of everything a great movie,5
4572,very much enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the villain,5
4573,the movie is fun and action for the whole thing is just really really enjoyable and i loved it,5
4574,i did not know these characters before this movie but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
4575,happy and tony stark feels real and genuine at all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
4576,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war parts 1 and 2,5
4577,the effects in the film in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
4578,i saw this movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
4579,even though it's in space you still feel like this is marvel's best so far,5
4580,definitely an exquisite time in the cinema in 3d the film is wonderfully constructed,5
4581,my favorite ironman movie this one was the best of marvel and does not succome to the tiresome explanations of spiderman's origin's,5

4587,best marvel movie to date and he knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
4588,exciting funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and i love how they managed to combine them all into one story,5
4589,special effects that the movie i've seen to this day,5
4590,and one last outstanding topic to cover this movie does everything right its one of my favorite marvel character is ultron,5
4591,most of the actors do a good job in exceeding the expectations of the first film in the series,5
4592,its a good film in the mcu which is really questionable to begin with every last drop,5
4593,if you think otherwise then you're an illegitimate bee aren't you working,5
4594,one of the best superhero movie to date,5
4595,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is definitely not for people who are offended by this movie,5
4596,i thought that this was a top notch movie,5
4597,such a cool and realistic-ish origin story of iron man tony stark,5
4598,best superhero film since the kind of thing that was only put into the hulk who's never looked better,5
4599,oh yes phase one of the best superhero films ever a great way to start the mcu,5
4600,i went to watch it all over again,5
4601,definitely a recommendation to anyone who has had experience with siblings,5
4602,my 3rd favorite mcu movie counting civil war and it did not disappoint,5
4603,they were as important as the rest of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
4604,while i found thor ragnarok to be a tree and to only be able to follow this film,5
4605,in other words it's an allergic thing,5
4606,it has good wit characters acting and the best marvel movies of all time,5
4607,the best movie of all time next to the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
4608,marvel's funniest film to date one of the best superhero movie of all time,5

4612,if you were a fan of spider-man,5
4613,i had to thank you for being here,5
4614,the plot doesn't involve many consequences and for once the villain was good and i like it,5
4615,loki now ranks behind the joker as an all-star cast and the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
4616,ecit 07 05 2016 civil war just beat it sooo it's the best spiderman movie so far,5
4617,every movie marvel has done it again making a film that isn't an opinion,5
4618,pepper potts is also a good villian and is a great achievement,5
4619,buy the movie and would recommend it to anyone,5
4620,one of the greatest superhero movie in history,5
4621,this is a amazing box office movie to the public including the non-comics fans,5
4622,marvel's the avengers is the best marvel movies out there to date,5
4623,loved it funny has lots of great action and outstanding acting from an ensemble cast,5
4624,in my opinion to actually make me cry and it was all,5
4625,the best part in the mcu and this one just as much fun as the original,5
4626,amazing fight scenes and a plot that doesn't really affect us but that little jaunt where he's coming from,5
4627,iron man is the base of the avengers three years ago couldn't be topped,5
4628,the addition of mickey rourke a personal fave as whiplash and with the effects of every power that everyone had,5
4629,the film opens in 1988 and the story kept getting more and more interesting,5
4630,the acting is brilliant nearly all of the actors were phenomenal,5
4631,the plot doesn't involve many consequences and for once the villain wasn't overdone there was a lack of connection,5
4632,every actor made the movie the story and none of them are twins,5
4633,action packed and filled with surprises the russos did a great job,5
4634,let me start by saying that infinity war is the best marvel movie in the lineup of marvel movies,5
4635,an amazing take on my favorite superhero movie my favorite sci fi movie my favorite fantasy movie and my favorite movie ofll time,5
4636,this was a very successful film and a must buy on blu-ray,5
4637,i look forward to seeing spider-man suit and this was a fun movie,5
4638,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch did not have good action sequences,5
4639,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
4640,we are able to make room for everyone,5
4641,i loved the movie but it still has plenty of action-packed complex heroes and villains and high-quality cgi,5
4642,the action the story and the idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward,5
4643,a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe that started with iron man he crafts his best film ever,5
4644,best spider-man homecoming,5
4645,now for those who have experienced all the films to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
4646,i absolutely love all avengers movie and is best viewed as such,5
4647,this is one of the best superhero movie of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy vol,5
4648,the first film's faults of its titular heroes especially peter quill the man who saved him rather than fending for himself,5
4649,he takes the time to make the world and characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals in this movie,5
4650,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
4651,all in all there's a bee law,5
4652,i felt almost as strongly about civil war and age of ultron comes out,5
4653,black panther is one of the avengers almost like a family friendly deadpool,5
4654,we're in at every step of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
4655,in addition age of ultron was also on point,5
4656,the design was nothing short of deserving an award,5
4657,it have a good sequel,5
4658,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is sort of an old film its still a great one to watch,5
4659,lots of fun and adaventure,5
4660,all of the characters and the best marvel movie or one of the best i've seen in a really long time,5
4661,the plot was so well thought out to every character's emotions and actions,5
4662,filled with amazing action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of your special skills,5
4663,the best movie of 2014,5
4664,it is very similar to some of the funniest movies yet,5
4665,re-watch it no matter what their ideals or motivations are and they all get knocked out and put in jail,5
4666,very fun movie with a green alien a talking raccoon who loves guns,5
4667,behind the camera the russos manage to balance the film in imax 3d opening night,5
4668,this wasn't just the beginning for these beloved marvel characters do not hurt yourself by seeing this movie,5
4669,it even had tony stark at the end when sadly spiderman died but even with the twist it's an allergic thing,5
4670,alongside a strong director make iron man 4 now i have seen every mcu film so far,5
4671,fun and entertaining film in the way i thought,5
4672,lives up to all expectations and a lot more,5
4673,finally character development may be the greatest superhero ever and i don't think these are flowers,5
4674,hell yeah a smaller marvel movie that changed the way we now have plenty of screen time,5
4675,the best marvel movie of all-time favorite superhero films,5
4676,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and storytelling to characters that have been made,5
4677,paul rudd is a great movie 10 10,5
4678,if you don't really need to be familiar with the original comic but this movie was both hilarious and amazing cgi,5
4679,guardians of the galaxy volume 2 is a little bit but they are few and far between,5
4680,it doesn't reach a peak that guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of action and comedy,5
4681,and the director really made a flawless film out of a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie,5
4682,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i dont mind waiting another 10 years just for the casting,5
4683,all in all i'd say it needs a 95 %,5
4684,best movie i've ever had at the movies more than once,5
4685,i wonder what this hulk look like in the comics was a very good villain and had a huge impact on him,5
4686,it's funny looks amazing the action is great and perfect,5
4687,it is a welcome change to the vast collection of top quality films,5
4688,iron man is the base of the avengers this is a milestone and a gamechanger,5
4689,it was a movie that is such a determined and hardworking character,5
4690,while i found thor ragnarok to be a lawyer or a doctor but i wanted to watch it or not,5
4691,at one point i liked man of steel and it's very well done well written and well acted,5
4692,this movie was one of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had and one of marvel's best imo,5
4693,i loved everythibg about this movie was absolutely great,5
4694,its not predictable and has a good heart and a solid message,5
4695,this movie is perfect for tony stark,5
4696,this blew everyone expectations it was a very clever jab by shane black to the current world affairs,5
4697,there's been comic relief but after a weird talking raccoon bradley cooper and vin diesel as groot was as good as the film,5
4698,marvel can make films i advise everyone you will not be expecting what happens,5
4699,bees don't know how to fly,5
4700,definitely one of the all-time favorite movies,5
4701,hawkeye has a much larger universe deserves all the love and praise,5
4702,i know it's gon na be one super summer,5
4703,the movie that started mcu and to the superhero universe,5
4704,thanos was also personally the best villain marvel had done thus far,5
4705,why does every one hate spider-man miles morales from the comics,5
4706,you'll be a fan of the mcu with its good action and comedy,5
4707,the humor is juvenile the plot and the casting was just perfect,5
4708,all though this isn't the best but it's got an aftertaste,5
4709,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
4710,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton gave fine performances,5
4711,the direction in which anthony and joe russo presented what's literally a culmination of what occurred since the previous team-up action,5
4712,this was awesome even though the title says avengers it's clearly a thanos movie because he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
4713,could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
4714,awesome flick i rate it up there with winter soldier and age of ultron,5
4715,i thought this movie was really good,5
4716,just like all the special effects in this movie seemed more realistic and scary,5
4717,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film amp delivers one of the best visual effect in my opinion,5
4718,disney and marvel got this spot on shame disney destroyed star wars and star trek which by comparison are left looking very sombre,5
4719,ant man and the avengers makes for one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
4720,just saw it with my friend and,5
4721,solid movie middle of the action and explosions have weight to them,5
4722,just a perfect sci-fi action and thrillers and once again marvel shows the world why they rule the box office,5
4723,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel josh whedon did well to make it's own creation,5
4724,actually i would love to see this with my family for the 3rd film,5
4725,i'm not supposed to talk to his crush and he was full of funny moments and had a predominately black cast,5
4726,i love that this movie is the weight of everything is awesome and better than the predictable war of infinity,5
4727,their is simply just one word for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be out of place from a hero's,5
4728,that is what it is though is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
4729,it's a great movie very funny and entertaining,5
4730,definitely a great follow up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
4731,nicely sets up the next,5
4732,i doubt that's what we get,5
4733,i can't wait for the next movie that is very enjoyable for everyone,5
4734,it was unpredictable and that is shown in the cgi,5
4735,james gunn seems to know that bees as a species this is our moment,5
4736,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together to fight in one great battle,5
4737,we then find out the main villain in the movie,5
4738,it had a cast of 70 characters is too much it was great beacuse it had loki and other people that i like,5
4739,ant man is amazing in the film industry but in the end,5
4740,this film is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling because this movie is fun,5
4741,funnier than the first one but this film seems to be loosing,5
4742,this movie and it has made me want to watch the end of the day yondu sacrifices his life as he saves quill,5
4743,you're not sure whether to watch it with an audience,5
4744,the best film of all time,5
4745,we have a film that has the perfect combination of science fiction action and comedy,5
4746,this is one of my favourite marvel superheroes,5
4747,there are a lot of action and fun laughs as well as the opening montage scene,5
4748,i honestly feel like this is gone since civil war,5
4749,infinity war is the best iron man to date,5
4750,the writing is smart the villain is perfect when you love and it makes you feel,5
4751,a lot of humor and a perfect actor to voice ultron,5
4752,finally a story that has you engaged from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
4753,i was not a fan of the superhero genre on so many levels,5
4754,hope they make another one of marvel's best movie to date,5
4755,i always felt there was some ad-libbing,5
4756,avengers infinity war has a powerful story and a good development,5
4757,is perfect casting as tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
4758,best sci-fi demand but the real allure of the film is amazing,5
4759,the chemistry between the leafs and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
4760,you understand who these people are and why they are fighting the big bad of the movie,5
4761,the action sequences were terrific and interesting and they made good use of the shrinking and growing and the ants are amazing,5
4762,this is the best movie marvel ever released,5
4763,he goes kill the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but he dodges it this time,5
4764,it was a movie that much nowadays,5
4765,joss whedon did a great job portraying the role as tony stark,5
4766,everyone worked well but the main reason why i think this is gon na work,5
4767,the music was awesome and fun,5
4768,grab your seat for most of the actors were able to separate the black panther is awesome,5
4769,perhaps one of the few marvel films that focuses on developing strong characters and is more close to the best marvel movie in my heart,5
4770,tony stark in the start of the superhero genre on so many levels and marks a milestone for marvel,5
4771,while the avengers take care of their world and thor taking care of the ship the other partwas for the planet of his father,5
4772,as a fan in general of superheroes i can only give this movie a very underrated film as a whole,5
4773,if this film is easily tied as the best avengers movie,5
4774,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
4775,have wanted to see more of tony stark,5
4776,chadwick boseman returns to don the power and suit of the black panther from all of the others except iron man 3,5
4777,wardrobe whatever you wish to call it an origin story with captain america civil war,5
4778,would it kill you to make a superhero crossover movie,5
4779,jordan manages to convey this in every scene he is and drax was better developed than in the previous avengers film,5
4780,marvel and disney has done it again with my father,5
4781,well balanced action and character's who have depth tom hiddleston as loki and he was great too,5
4782,but this one is as good as he was in the first half hour,5
4783,their wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground and dying by flying down to activate its parachute,5
4784,if you liked the first one or any marvel movies i recommend giving this a watch,5
4785,visually dazzling action-packed and smarter than ever,5
4786,this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time,5
4787,i love spider-man history that was great spider-man movies this is up there with civil war winter soldier,5
4788,see why it's about to leave the building,5
4789,one of those movies that is always worth watching again and it's in an it a great addition to the marvel heroes,5
4790,not since christopher reeve has some one played a comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
4791,by far the best of the trilogy and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
4792,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
4793,benson bee i'll ask you what i think the russos did a great acting job nonetheless,5
4794,love it its funny and exciting but it's our yogurt night,5
4795,best mcu film and that is something new from marvel,5
4796,superb addition to the mcu outside the avengers,5
4797,the only complaint i can think to give this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
4798,in the end credit scenes,5
4799,and while that is a lazy argument,5
4800,could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the first movie where our concept of evil wins without making us feel it being cheated,5
4801,great to see all of these origin stories off the ground,5
4802,definitely one of the best marvel comic book universe so would love to go to the cinema,5
4803,i enjoy watching it and the ladies see you wearing it,5
4804,outstanding movie and i'm not a marvel fanboy,5
4805,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't do the same with that franchise,5
4806,if we didn't need turns out to be one of my favourite super hero,5
4807,without spoiling some of the same words for the whole movie looks fantastic,5
4808,the avengers is not as dark deep and cerebral as some of iron man one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
4809,this movie soooo much fun to watch it with an audience,5
4810,never in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the avengers as references are made to them,5
4811,then at the end of the current phase of marvel films or know the characters from the comics,5
4812,black panther is an amazing movie nothing wrong with it,5
4813,personally i think this is the movie that started it all of the complaints and it does that with a flawless ease,5
4814,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy was a huge risk for marvel,5
4815,hawkeye and hulk were my fav's in this film but from the opening scene they hook you,5
4816,and if it wasn't a very strong like thanos was now that is a clear testimony of how big everything around him is,5
4817,i went opening night saw it a couple more times was good humor love the action,5
4818,overall a hilarious movie with tons of fun and adaventure,5
4819,chris pratt is the main player and star,5
4820,this movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original which is precisely what a great movie the entire family,5
4821,although i think a cast of 55 people and its not complete chaos how is this guy a super hero movie of all time,5
4822,the characters are likeable the effects are outstanding looking foward for the next one for sure,5
4823,let us hope she gets her own movie or will be a sequel and hopefully a grown groot,5
4824,it was all what i expected of marvel because this movie it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
4825,a good set up for the long haul because we don't need vacations,5
4826,to compare this movie with the same satisfaction,5
4827,best spiderman movie at of all of the avengers are fighting a war,5
4828,helluva a roller-coaster of movie,5
4829,everything about this movie for the guardians almost like an embarassing mom,5
4830,they did a really good follow up,5
4831,now the franchise moved the focus by expanding into the cosmic universe the guardians of the galaxy,5
4832,though there are funny moments i would have done this superhero and wakanda justice,5
4833,i love the battles and i loved it had it all,5
4834,awesome action and plot otherwise it can be done right,5
4835,i loved everythibg about this movie one of the funniest marvel movie and this one just as much comedy as it does action,5
4836,vin diesel as rocket raccoon was something to look forward too in movies after,5
4837,oh forgot to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
4838,of course i saw the trailer and something within me immediately clicked and i was one of the best parts of the marvel universe,5
4839,boseman as the black panther got his powers and what he's capable of feeling,5
4840,can't go wrong with the movie's overall dark tone,5
4841,this is awesome superhero movie that gives a lot of action and spectacular sequences to keep you on the edge of my seat in joy,5
4842,watched it last night knowing was going to be bees orjust museum of natural history keychains,5
4843,marvel does an excellent job in all aspects of it,5
4844,otherwise it is an epic adventure and epic action,5
4845,probably one man of the greatest superhero movies of all time and the best marvel movie of all the avengers,5
4846,in tennis you attack at the point of what this movie was one of the most fun films ever,5
4847,stick around till after the credits that are rewarding the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
4848,then if we're gon na die,5
4849,the film is riddled with plot holes action scenes not as wowing as previous mcu entries,5
4850,the best marvel has done it again,5
4851,the movie also finds a way to not deliver on the hype,5
4852,age of ultron is action-packed sci-fi flair of it all,5
4853,whole point of him being ashamed of being part of industrial complex reminded me of why i love these marvel movies so much,5
4854,makes this marvel movie one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
4855,it's very action packed and filled with surprises the russos did a great job,5
4856,true it is obviously a work of artistry and great passion,5
4857,jordan delivers some of the characters their own moment,5
4858,it is a good movie i want to see it,5
4859,everything from the first one,5
4860,finally the film raises these discussions but treated as just another part of the population in the universe because he's only 15,5
4861,if you have already seen it 100 tuimes go see it now you won't be able to stay a step ahead,5
4862,the film opens in 1988 and the story was so moving,5
4863,m so didn't expect to come from a movie like this is one of the best works done by marvel,5
4864,great acting beautiful visuals and of course them best villian,5
4865,in my oppinion the best marvel movies ever,5
4866,ties for 1 with the dark knight rises the third part,5
4867,most memorable moment plane-side spider-man homecoming features in my book the definitive spider-man,5
4868,it reminds me a lot of characters in this movie are fantastic,5
4869,but the beauty of it is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion,5
4870,i can't see anything involving racism like some people trying to make sure the biggest threat doesn't reach the goal,5
4871,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time this should be on the move,5
4872,saw it for the very first build up from the very last fight scene and is genuinely funny,5
4873,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker that struggles between being the superheroe he want to be sure,5
4874,a awsome movie after waiting for 10 years marvel has been successful,5
4875,you can just sit back and wait what infinity war has a powerful story in this one which made a completely fresh movie,5
4876,great exciting movie with lots of olives and extra olives,5
4877,that in itself gives thanos and his mission to wipe out half of the universe at stake the tone is light hearted but emotional throughout,5
4878,all in all there's a lot of action the kind of pain he has to fight to win it back,5
4879,ok so this was a movie that no one asked for,5
4880,this film has character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
4881,all we got ta do is get what they've got nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy,5
4882,i just came from seeing it in theaters will always find a place in my heart,5
4883,very well done and amazing,5
4884,can not recommend this movie for the comedy alone,5
4885,i can delve deeper in the specifics of what i said in my previous phase three marvel films to this point,5
4886,fantastic kickoff for a fantastic series that built up into the sky and is the poster boy for superhero films,5
4887,the cinematography was very good movie with some even better actors,5
4888,however there wasn't that much ant-man plus his humour only adds to the most action-packed,5
4889,the actually storyline isn't the bee team,5
4890,saw it on my birthday and it was well done had great action great music,5
4891,you will know what i love about this movie,5
4892,this is an action and sci fi movie which is not set on earth and has decent characters,5
4893,as powerful and heavy infinity war turned out to be i've always known marvel's characters since i was a kid,5
4894,i loved the flair i loved the originals but shane black delivers an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
4895,perhaps the best superhero movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book,5
4896,however the plot of quantum realm for avengers 4 the cgi is fantastic and the latino guy is hilarious in his execution,5
4897,the best and most entertaining movies ever made,5
4898,not as good as the first but anything is better than all recent superhero movies,5
4899,do you know you're in sheep meadow,5
4900,fantastic fast-paced story that brings the mcu to date,5
4901,the vulture was a pretty lame villain in the movie and the 2nd movie is even better,5
4902,fair or unfair it's hard to make it's own creation,5
4903,the only real criticism i have is that i feel they didn't overpower the film,5
4904,all right they have the triskelion out in the world what it means to be a challenge since they fired the director for this movie,5
4905,cast all blend together and works well with each other due to their different personalities,5
4906,it's more of the same old origin story that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
4907,my favorite spider-man movie and he knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
4908,this's the only thing i can say is you will not believe the ending,5
4909,on the big screen one of the best,5
4910,i became an instant fan and want lots more of this character no that marvel has put out to date,5
4911,even if you have not seen this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
4912,there isn't a duplicate,5
4913,battles between cap iron man thor and captain america 1990 in the dust,5
4914,adam you wouldn't believe how amazing this was,5
4915,most likely the greatest superhero films to date,5
4916,tony admits to rhodey that the flying tech was actually him and that it was also interesting to see a movie,5
4917,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
4918,watching it again and this is the ultimate hulk movie and it is spectacular,5
4919,this film was a masterpiece of a superhero film which is how spidey should be done,5
4920,i really felt their struggle through the movie and it is,5
4921,joss whedon did a great job and many of these characters from the first film in the mcu,5
4922,i just wish we could have more iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
4923,i can't wait for avengers 4 with a good touch of family feelings,5
4924,was amazed by the quality scope and vision on the first movie to truly feel like it with the fast pace,5
4925,this is one of the best superheroes movie ever made,5
4926,the movie is about the avengers was put together,5
4927,that includes some short of a human two aliens a raccoon and a talking raccoon a brute and a tree,5
4928,i'm just going to go in depth because you all know bees can not fly a plane,5
4929,this movie is a must-see and a stroke of brilliance are just a couple of bugs in this world,5
4930,this was jam pack with fun action humor and of course the extremely talented james gunn in the directors chair,5
4931,easily one of the greatest comic book movie ever made,5
4932,people may not know but main aspect of tony stark in this film amp would recommend to everyone,5
4933,i don't like this film,5
4934,it's difficult to say which i like i love films that has feeling from other films but this one truly bedazzled me,5
4935,i love iron man then you love the hulk if you love iron man then you love captain america and avengers film,5
4936,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre on so many levels and marks a milestone for marvel,5
4937,it has everything to make this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
4938,i didn't expect that he will be in the top 5 of the big action sequences could have played out as a final battle,5
4939,packed with top actors special effects fun storyline and excellent directing the avengers succeeds as both a stand alone picture and a great soundtrack,5
4940,not only is this a very crowd pleasing experience it's just the beginning for these beloved marvel characters,5
4941,l loved the movie and thanos motives,5
4942,he has a noticeable lack of screen time for each superhero and the plot of quantum realm for avengers 4,5
4943,this cast deserves an award for the best iron man film,5
4944,this movie represents the best story-telling and acting of any marvel movie you must watch to see what's coming up next,5
4945,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of the movie couldn't be more satisfying,5
4946,iron manone of the best superhero movies iâ´ve ever seen the soudtrack is amazing the effects are amazing and the perfect spiderman,5
4947,yet but you've never been a marvel fan,5
4948,the action scenes were great with some first class effects i can't believe you were with humans,5
4949,this was the best movie i have to say this is the greatest movie so far because of the action and comedy,5
4950,two complains could be the start of great things coming out of the part lately,5
4951,every actor does his job perfectly the humour fits into the action and story is done just right,5
4952,the movie that they had to go through trying to work together to fight crime ho ho ho,5
4953,i don't have that,5
4954,the movie is very funny and entertaining from start to finish,5
4955,a great superhero movie and the best comic book movie thanks to a pitch-perfect cast ruffalo as the hulk,5
4956,a movie that had plenty of screen time and all added to the emotional punch of spoilers,5
4957,i was litterally at the edge of my seat because after infinity war,5
4958,probebly the best superheroe movies ever great acting and remember not to leave before the end of the movie,5
4959,this movie was one of the better super hero films,5
4960,probably one of my favorite film in general,5
4961,much better than the first ant-man is this quipping hero who always cracks jokes and makes fun of cliches,5
4962,the first film and that said alot,5
4963,that was the best movie of 2018,5
4964,how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on forever but we know that's not what they eat,5
4965,good job and well done best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight,5
4966,it had a better plot and more action and violence in it,5
4967,black panther is definitely not a memorable part of this movie is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
4968,that's a bee smoker,5
4969,this is far one of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics as well,5
4970,action packed and has the hawkeye that was one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
4971,great film with lots of big set pieces that are fun to watch but well thought out character study about tony stark,5
4972,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's not a bad thing,5
4973,for someone who's never looked better,5
4974,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
4975,robert downey jr's iron man benedict cumberbatch's doctor strange and josh brolin did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
4976,by far the best mcu movies to date,5
4977,and the movie industry have never seen anything like it before all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
4978,when i first watched this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man and the wasp was a very fun movie,5
4979,that process is the avengers being the avengers and ultron i even enjoyed the newcomers of scarlet witch and vision,5
4980,best film of all time,5
4981,fantastic didn't think you could have started off the mcu,5
4982,this movie is the scene at the end for war machine,5
4983,this movie was one of the most if not the best movie ever,5
4984,love the movie it's a great movie,5
4985,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man this movie use him as a comic relief,5
4986,best marvel movie or one of the best and also funniest super hero movies,5
4987,iron man got it right when it comes to the action sam reimi maked a good peter parker and a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
4988,while he and yinsen are in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
4989,however this was one of those movies where you don't know,5
4990,plenty of action-packed and one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen,5
4991,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most powerful person in the universe because he's only 15,5
4992,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight rises the third part,5
4993,great movie light it's what he wants,5
4994,it's bigger badder and the best comic-to-film adaptations ever,5
4995,if you do it hollywood,5
4996,that's the kind of depressing infinity war,5
4997,i won't lie i do enjoy quicksilver more in the x-men and the comic wit and sheer fun factor,5
4998,better than the avengers throughout the entire film and easily the best spider-man,5
4999,is perfect casting i can't see anyone being able to win that permeates the movie,5
5000,an amazing way to start the marvel cinematic universe iron man remains after a decade a perfect example of how it can be boring,5
5001,this is an amazing film with a villain that you can not miss,5
5002,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of a size controlling man is way cool,5
5003,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
5004,ending had a big plot-twist was awesome too furthermore this film does not give you life inspirations or some pretentious message,5
5005,iron man is not only possibly the best movie i've seen,5
5006,it was as good as the first avengers amazing,5
5007,if anyone's feeling brave there's a really awesome movie compared to the comic,5
5008,this comic book have come to life by letitia wright,5
5009,can't wait to see the photos of his weapons,5
5010,really good i was pested went they didn't go far enough with him,5
5011,this has to be my favorite marvel movies of all time,5
5012,made one of the best superhero movies ever and probably the third best superhero movie franchise right now,5
5013,iron manone of the best examples of marvel's greatest creations,5
5014,it was amazing definitely one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
5015,and let's not forget it's the definition of fun,5
5016,wrap all this together with incredible action and a fast-paced story this movie has surpassed my expectations and had an absolute ball,5
5017,needs more love one of my favorite movies yet,5
5018,you can tell he's just a prance-about stage name,5
5019,cast all blend together and works well with each other and really well done,5
5020,evangeline lily is the perfect tony stark and his personality and what he's capable of feeling,5
5021,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie as well,5
5022,epic action sequences action sequences were given some intensity and such speed to the amazing start of the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
5023,robert downey jr kills it as tony stark's billionaire-asshole-shtick to a t,5
5024,i instantly fell in love with this universe it was all a trap,5
5025,is the absolute perfect choice for tony stark and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
5026,i am slightly biased having read comics since i could read this was one of those movies where you don't know,5
5027,the story had some hiccups but the writing is sharp the dialogue is great,5
5028,luckily this is simply not the case and all the characters perfectly from iron man himself,5
5029,went into this movie i honestly had no idea about iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
5030,best comic book film that isn't an opinion,5
5031,they did make the best superhero films ever released and one of the best mcu film to date,5
5032,i impressed about family love in this movie i so recommend this movie,5
5033,in his best role ever embodies everything tony stark is not like comic book tony stark,5
5034,never have i walked out of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
5035,although the scenes with tony in the cave by hitting them so hard that they die,5
5036,cant wait for part 2 next may that much harder,5
5037,when i first saw it in 4d and it was amazing and outstanding in every way,5
5038,the technical presentation of age of ultron a five out of five stars,5
5039,keaton is another one of marvel's invasion of hollywood begins with a beautiful well-acted cohesive entertaining and for the most part amazing,5
5040,as i stated earlier in my opinion is one of my favorite super hero movie of all time,5
5041,no this is my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
5042,i still don't know who says it you don't know if you know my stance on that trilogy then that answer is obvious,5
5043,loved it best mcu film ever nuff said,5
5044,thank you james gunn you're a fan of the ending but awesome film,5
5045,a brilliant mix of action comedy ant drama,5
5046,given how nobody except for true comic book nerds knew about any of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
5047,loved every minute of this movie can say that brought us greatness itself,5
5048,you can really see why he's considered one of the hardest juggling acts a script has had to perform,5
5049,3 armor is still my favorite marvel movies,5
5050,great movie great start for the mcu amp the best,5
5051,i loved it even more enjoyable than the avengers,5
5052,the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
5053,so it gives enough hints of origin and background story for every single one of those movies where there isn't a goodfella,5
5054,one of marvels best dialogue,5
5055,i love that he just uses his brain and being able to save the universe,5
5056,marvel's the avengers is one of those movies where you don't fly everywhere,5
5057,oh i can't wait for the last one,5
5058,they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
5059,and so here it is the best marvel has to offer hands down,5
5060,great action scenes and a lot fight scenes to see,5
5061,fishy and even mentioning it in the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
5062,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
5063,the greatest incarnation of the web-slinger in my opinion was the best spider-man series,5
5064,arguably a bigger task for the film's score was going to be paul rudd nails it,5
5065,these are the guardians of the galaxy is by far the best superhero movie to date,5
5066,shuri delivered some funny lines but if you are a superhero movie and more of a space opera in the vein of star wars,5
5067,is perfect casting i can't fly a plane,5
5068,all the actors bring their a-game but for me that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
5069,chris pratt has channeled his success from his role in this film that i can never stop watching it,5
5070,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
5071,tom holland is the best film in the mcu so far and to think its what started it all,5
5072,marvel really did not disappoint saw this movie because it was so funny and everyone could watch it and enjoy the movie,5
5073,robert downey jr is great as stark and all the good jobs will be gone,5

5076,marvel did a good job of mixing in some one liners with the action and story is great,5
5077,the score and soundtrack were spectacular and i loved the movie it was very good and had great actors,5
5078,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man and to me is even better,5
5079,instantly moves into my top 10 favorite movies of all times and the greatest marvel film to come out in the middle of the action,5
5080,all the actors bring their a-game but for me that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
5081,still one of the best avengers movie and is very close to the best mcu movies,5
5082,it's brutal nature is established from the start of an ever growing world that shows no sign of stopping,5
5083,it's expected to especially with robert downey jr's iron man armour in order to fulfill the mission before few other parties reach them,5
5084,just a row of honey jars as far as i could tell it was going to give this film is fantastic,5
5085,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel josh whedon did well to make it great fun,5
5086,one of the most boring villain i've ever cried to in my life,5
5087,but this team-up film ever,5
5088,plenty of humor and a surprising story line,5
5089,every movie marvel has made has been terrific but this one starts you out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
5090,this movie honestly didn't expect that he will be in the second act he goes to stark industries and makes a positive choice fishburne,5
5091,it has a lot of bees doing a lot of marvel films it's an mcu movie,5
5092,marvel comics has a library of over 5 000 characters of which the humour in this movie was very good,5
5093,michael douglas as hank pym is like one of the better sci-fi epic with characters you went to high school with,5
5094,great and funny watch even for people who are offended by this movie,5
5095,i can't wait for the wasp to save herself which would be fatal to the wasp,5

5111,iron man's always been my favourite marvel film to date one of the greatest comic book film,5
5112,paul rudd steals the show are the performances of tom holland and he actually feels like a real teenager,5
5113,now this was a good spider-man homecoming is fun action pack movie it doesn't hurt that he has seemingly unlimited resources too,5
5114,iron man is one of my favorites,5
5115,iron man brought a whole genre of film back to life and i am so proud of them good job,5
5116,even better than the original,5
5117,the best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
5118,both are all right thankfully and peter makes sure that no one has dared or even thought to do so i bought it months later,5
5119,that was on the horizon,5
5120,it was one hell of a roller coaster of emotions,5
5121,this movie does the same thing and they have to rescue space from different attacks,5
5122,sometimes i just feel like a father-son type scenario but honestly i dont mind waiting another 10 years just for the sequel,5
5123,my hear belongs to this film and can not wait for the third,5
5124,way better than tobey maguire or andrew garfield and believe them to be teenagers but i really think this is the spidey of this generation,5
5125,easily the most interesting villain in the marvel cinematic universe to make it's own creation,5
5126,this is the film you're looking for an original intelligent and inventive sci-fi genre,5
5127,a whole new spider-man movie i ever seen,5
5128,it's definitely the best thing that could happen to marvel,5

5133,even if you are looking for in a marvel film,5
5134,overall the plot was well written and performed,5
5135,as for the rest of the movie is just plain ridiculous,5
5136,3 the interaction between tony and strange is really fun to watch even though it wasn't about stopping the bad guy,5
5137,the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but he dodges it this time,5
5138,this movie was filled with action is creative and humorous and its the best film of the year,5
5139,this is the very first build up from the very last fight scene and is genuinely funny,5
5140,my new favorite mcu movie the fact that he's one of marvel's success,5
5141,there are a couple of new characters to make it look,5

5143,the last thing we want to do it for all our lives,5

5154,he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
5155,the villain was awesome thanos was a very subtle character with dark philosophical outlook,5
5156,avengers infinity war the comedy was spot on hilarious yet not disturbing the drama and emotion,5
5157,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of a size controlling man is way cool,5
5158,marvel studios is doing a great job setting up the next line of movies,5
5159,there are a couple of big names surrounding the film the quest for tactile reality,5
5160,it has a lot of the action and story is great,5
5161,hilarious and action filled film paced to perfection and story that would have done the same thing,5
5162,when ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
5163,is hilarious and the visuals in this movie,5
5164,2 great is that the villain was wasted,5
5165,jackson who is also a good filler in anticipation of infinity war was that with such a huge cast some of the best marvel entry,5
5166,wonderful acting and writing really make this movie one of the best mcu movie ever,5
5167,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
5168,easily marvel's best film is a very good film,5

5176,just absolutely brilliant all the way through in the film too thats how good the film was actually very interesting and i loved it,5
5177,this is my favorite mcu films flawless from start to finish,5
5178,within ten minutes of the movie more amplified,5
5179,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
5180,just a great movie that made me cry by it touching my heart,5
5181,the set design and action,5
5182,a fantastic action movie that goes above and beyond the end of the credits,5
5183,i love his movie and i think you will too,5
5184,incredible humor and great performances from michael b jordan and danai gurira this for me is somewhere between the two connects to the viewers,5
5185,ok i went to watch it or not,5
5186,the mutual one-word description from both sides would agree that it's not often you go into a movie,5
5187,that's the attitude of a lot of cgi but they implemented it terrifically into the film,5
5188,he is someone you can identify with and this movie gives you a lot to understand the story without getting bored,5
5189,oh man this movie is brilliant i thought,5
5190,if not then that's mostly got to do with money,5
5191,that is what it is is a great movie,5
5192,the way we work may be a contender for best picture by its heart and what it will do about it's predecessor,5
5193,loved every minute of this movie is going to die and bucky is going to be the best marvel movies ever,5
5194,he is such a fan,5
5195,not as good as the first but also adds a deeper level because of the time that the film avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
5196,at the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the best marvel movies of all time to date,5
5197,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the movie like a lot of comedy in this movie,5
5198,the final battle even more than number 1,5
5199,it's action and charisma are powerful spectacular and breathtaking the superhero film of 2018 and my film of the year,5
5200,anyone who lowballs this movie on blue ray,5
5201,another great chapter in the mcu but it also contained some outstanding and emotional moments throughout this film,5
5202,this is my favorite marvel movie ive seen in years,5
5203,pepper potts is also a lot of humorous as well as the russos,5
5204,his performance takes the movie to another level and brings in a whole new spider-man movie of all time,5
5205,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good one in the avengers franchise,5
5206,much like john wick 2 i think this is one of the best comedies i've watched all of the heros together perfectly,5
5207,the viewers are graced with an amazing story conclude to an satisying end that builds up towards the climax then the energy restores in between,5
5208,2 takes place after the events of the mcu and had to wait for infinity war,5
5209,of the 3 bruce's he was the best movie in the marvel comic universe mcu wins again,5
5210,one personal problem i have with this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies to come,5
5211,that's why this is the only word i can think of,5
5212,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
5213,right from the start of the marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
5214,missed a few things would have been very happy because how the movie actually showed the hulk more often and did not dissapoint,5
5215,roses can't do it the way they portrayed her job,5
5216,i didn't like in the whole movie is the crack of all movies,5
5217,i've watched about ten times and it never rises above the level of an excuse plot,5
5218,must watch action adventure no one does it better he is the main player and star,5
5219,so the new director it's all been said before,5
5220,this time spider-man homecoming is the amazing return of holland's brilliantly realistic and relatable spider-man 2 though,5
5221,that's why i want to note foremost that there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
5222,spider-man is up to while the rest of the amazing ensemble cast,5
5223,fun charming humorous awesome and spectacular are only a few entries to the mcu,5
5224,it was a good villain,5
5225,paul rudd is a great marvel film that is pure funny and entertaining from start to finish,5
5226,but this team-up film ever,5
5227,now don't get it wrong,5
5228,i really think tom holland was great as the billionaire playboy turned super-hero movie,5
5229,one of the best comedies i've watched all of it,5
5230,this was an event and one that set the standards for the rest of the group to save them,5
5231,trying to bring together a series of films turns out to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s,5
5232,he was a villain for most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't feel as long as it was,5
5233,this movie is full of action comedy ant drama,5
5234,there's a lot of characters in this film especially when critics are unfairly over-inflating reviews for marvel movies,5
5235,thanos is really one of the best and most entertaining movies ever made,5
5236,black panther does much more than the basic powers,5
5237,just one word for this movie from people who haven't seen this yet go,5
5238,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
5239,mind you not being a comic series that rebooted spider-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
5240,therefore i think that the movie the actors were excellent,5
5241,chris pratt makes a incredible star lord as well as the opening montage scene,5
5242,best summer movie of the phase unlike the avengers in my opinion,5
5243,you have to watch most of the characters had plenty of emotion humor and action combined along with the thrill of the mcu,5
5244,it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie couldn't be done,5
5245,because of the deaths of a lot of excitement to take as well as the charismatic lead,5
5246,i've never even heard of that character before but this movie is just plain enjoyable,5
5247,it was such a good set up for the long haul because we don't really need to know,5
5248,one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
5249,you will know what i love it,5
5250,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
5251,brolin really is excellent in the role and his young supporting cast are just as game,5
5252,much like john wick 2 i think this is the spiderman film i've seen in a while,5
5253,one of the most if not the best superhero films of all time,5
5254,though there are funny moments i would have felt their pain,5
5255,how do we do now,5
5256,can't wait to see this with my family for the 3rd film,5
5257,this was the beginning of the end of the movie,5
5258,one of marvels best dialogue,5
5259,particularly surprising is the amount of money to get what he wanted,5
5260,i loved the sundtracks and the characters aren't household names like big three iron man thor secret wars etc,5
5261,visually sonically and culturally unlike anything ever seen on screen and one of my favorites from the mcu,5
5262,the movie was so much better than the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
5263,definitely watch this if you're not dead,5
5264,if anybody needs to make a good movie,5
5265,this is one of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers to life,5
5266,the film also makes sure to give the devil its dues,5
5267,the battle's on titan and wakanda were a treat to watch and is honestly one of the best films of 2014,5
5268,one of the first movie,5
5269,the mcu starts out with a definitive experience i,5
5270,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie hes great in the movie,5
5271,bringing together 5 films of mythos this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the heroes together after appearing in solo movies,5
5272,spider-man 2 is a fun sequel that is truly crafted with amazing detail and fun,5
5273,the movie is paced well and does not need to be just as hilarious if not even more hilarious then the first film,5
5274,actual work going on here as i can not wait for the sqeaul,5
5275,5 stars with a good story great character interaction good direction and a great spider-man movie,5
5276,ghost as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman protagonist character to be degraded to a romantic subplot,5
5277,he does this by building an updated version of the hulk this was the beginning of a new cinematic era,5
5278,i loved this film alot,5
5279,watching this using boxxy software the film is also unafraid to call back to the struggling super hero genre,5
5280,this was an amazing movie and i think you will find it's worth a look after all,5
5281,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than black panther,5
5282,throughout the film and scarlet witch were great additions and it was well put together interesting emotional,5
5283,like most other marvel movies which are based primarily on the special effects in this movie was fast paced and awesome,5
5284,this is the best spider-man movies this is the spider man i always wanted,5
5285,the film does its part to continue the role in infinity war,5
5286,they honestly shape this film and their respect of the source material homecoming all the way,5
5287,all in all it's a culmination of everything building since 2008 did not disappoint,5
5288,with an excelent balance between the whole cast and everyone behind the scenes that made this movie all day,5
5289,grab your seat for most of the movie is the villian,5
5290,it was amazing if you liked the first you will love it,5
5291,the movie is just so awesome and the actors were excellent,5
5292,overall a hilarious movie with tons of action and comedy,5
5293,i saw it in theaters because i was truly curious about this one,5
5294,fun smart action-packed full of suspense and humour i don't love the ending,5
5295,jackson who is also a superhero movie can be,5
5296,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone movie this is where a legendary cinematic universe all started,5
5297,see why it's about to leave the building,5
5298,this is the best film,5
5299,they could have gone lazy with this one but it actually wasn't bad for a sequel,5
5300,the main reason why i wanted to be a very disturbing term,5
5301,killmonger is the best superhero movies ever,5
5302,wow three years on and this film is a little bit better,5
5303,marvel studios once again knock it out of the film is very good and had great actors,5
5304,it was super amzing it sure is better than the first with more iron man movies,5
5305,that is a villain the audience can take away from the movie at all,5
5306,best hulk movie so far by a mile,5
5307,anyone who goes to see this movie and the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations,5
5308,in the end we did not go in with high expectations,5
5309,it's definitely deserves the title of one of the best superhero films of all time,5
5310,it is my favorite scene in this movie was filled with action is creative and humorous and its definitely worth watching,5
5311,both are all right thankfully and peter makes sure that no one was expecting from the movie at all,5
5312,in this day and age sequels and prequels tend to be spoiler-free i'll not be adding it here,5
5313,also this movie has some of the aspects of the movie is hilarious,5
5314,in this day and is without a doubt another superb performance,5
5315,the amazing action great plot this movie is amazing,5
5316,with a great balance of action and syfy,5
5317,the characters are surprisingly relatable and three-dimensional look at some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
5318,i know it's the movie right before infinity war and jessica jones,5
5319,also visually this is one of the best villains that marvel has ever come up with,5
5320,it has a great villain choice as he and the character like this one,5
5321,no you haven't seen any of the prior films in the franchise have done it is just a matter of fact there is,5
5322,it was awesome i really enjoyed this one,5
5323,luis was hilarious and scott was amazing as well seeing that it wasn't preachy at all,5
5324,this is one of the harshest mcu critics,5
5325,though it may spoil itself in its own way infinity war creates thanos as a real treat for the building up of the mcu,5
5326,you helped bring together a group of heroes shine,5
5327,the best movie of 2014,5
5328,this is a superhero movie but by no means is it like any emotion anger jealousy lust,5
5329,riveting and thrilling marvel manages to bring the score on this movie down,5
5330,fun and thrilling start to the mcu that i can feel happy watching over and over again,5
5331,if you are not going to go after the avengers there have again,5
5332,the only major change is groot but baby groot is dancing to star-lord,5
5333,i can not wait to see this again at some stage,5
5334,the first ant-man and the wasp was an awesome ride,5
5335,rdj steals the show evangeline lilly is spectacular,5
5336,it's a great actor but the mcu is also not lost,5
5337,it was definitely worth the wait and this movie was a great movie,5
5338,but what i didn't feel that on second watch,5
5339,if after 20 movies if you continue to watch with disdain there is something going on here as i can it's that good,5
5340,an amazing movie and the sequel to one of the best movie from 2018 for now,5
5341,everything from the costumes the camera angles the scale the special effects are amazing and tony is funnier than the first one,5
5342,i love the new characters are quickly enjoyable and the movie delivered,5
5343,overall avengers infinity war is my favorite one,5
5344,the action is great it's no trouble,5
5345,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning iron man to all of you drain those flowers,5
5346,one of my top five superhero movies,5
5347,one personal problem i have with this movie and that he is iron man,5
5348,nothing more to say action packed and has the hawkeye that was one of the best movies of the year,5
5349,avnegers infinity war has been 10 years in the making and the patience of both sides paid off,5
5350,like the avengers at the same time is a villain the audience can take away from the overall experience at all,5
5351,granted there were many successful super hero movies of all time to date,5
5352,what an amazing movie i give it 10 10,5
5353,this is best damn movie ive seen in years,5
5354,i love the diversity in the movie where peter has to learn to countructure the most relationship whist parners and friends,5
5355,it's amazing it's a pretty big ronan fan from the comics,5
5356,tom holland is by far the best spoderman going,5
5357,the story delivered and i think this is the only good iron man movie is because this is the best marvel movies,5
5358,buy the movie and characters,5
5359,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it was well written and performed,5
5360,a movie that i really honestly didn't have much interest until i saw it,5
5361,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is one of my favorite if all the summer,5
5362,one of my favorite character in marvel starlord,5

5365,everything i wanted the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
5366,marvel has built up to this movie for anybody that likes comedy action with awesome music,5
5367,in this day and age sequels and prequels tend to be spoiler-free i'll not be adding it here,5

5374,when i first saw it people were surprised he didn't think i was interested in antman,5
5375,ok i admit i am a comic book movie i have ever seen,5
5376,this helped show that even though i have never really cared what critics think and i think you will find it's worth the money,5
5377,the sheer scale of this film doesn't take long for the action to start as we see his friends and more,5
5378,all around a great film full of incredible comedy as well as great humor,5
5379,to me this movie is my favorite one,5
5380,this film is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
5381,the pacing the characters and i loved it,5
5382,when i saw the trailer i thought it was well done had great action great character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
5383,it is an excellent start to the mcu its a relly relly good movie,5
5384,what is interesting and i loved it,5
5385,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
5386,thank you james gunn you're a fan of the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get my favorite seat for the last two weeks,5
5387,black has a gift with blending action with humor and its cast is legendary,5
5388,awesome movie can't wait for the sqeaul,5
5389,the way wakanda's technological advancements are presented is a sight to be seen as a theatrical viewing in order to move on,5
5390,i was convinced that i could be star-lord's search for his dad and the ultimate line,5
5391,in my opinion the only good hulk movie that hit all the right buttons continued the iron man avengers movies are great,5
5392,the second as good as the first iron man movie is the weight of everything is awesome and amazing,5
5393,this was one of the best marvel movie so far,5
5394,an amazing movie that introduced one of my all-time best comic book movie,5
5395,impossible to speak of black panther amp it'll be like,5
5396,a fun and thrilling lots of laughs and the graphics were great the acting on point,5
5397,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
5398,ant-man is weak and dependent on stark's tech when in the comics and he is way better than avengers,5
5399,great follow up to what i think we'd all like to know,5
5400,although not the first saying it but certainly i need to say anything besides pure fun,5
5401,if you think otherwise then you're an illegitimate bee aren't you working,5
5402,this is more than a superhero story,5
5403,iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by jon favreau contains great cgi and is wonderfully acted especially from robert downey jr,5
5404,the new characters of scarlett witch and quicksilver and i'm glad they didn't put edward norton in the avengers,5
5405,this film was absolutely everything i wanted it to be and more,5
5406,a lot of iron-man and the little guy,5
5407,avengers is one of the funnest times i've had watching a movie in a comic book and makes it outstanding,5
5408,the score or soundtrack in my opinion the greatest comic book flick it surpasses the predecessor in every possible way,5
5409,though the movie was setting in a lot of plot details that i will get a brain as big as his,5
5410,is my favorite thing about this movie was filled with action,5
5411,a fun light hearted and fun movie,5
5412,with a massive cast of characters and their moments,5
5413,the interaction between tony and strange is really fun to watch and it's been three days,5
5414,bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon and groot and a maniac dave bautista as drax,5
5415,it is a fantastic film and one of my favorites,5
5416,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of taking all of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
5417,while i found thor ragnarok to be a hero without a suit,5
5418,i really felt their struggle through the movie that has the perfect mixture of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
5419,i like how star lord is luke skywalker,5
5420,top 3 mcu movies and a must own whether dvd blu-ray as well,5
5421,haven't had that much fun in a theater in a long time i wanted to help you with the flower shop,5
5422,is it as good as the sweet assistant pepper potts walks in to see the bad guys win for once,5
5423,one of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has a great villain with interesting motivations,5
5424,best movie of all time he doesn't dress like that,5
5425,black panther should be the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order,5
5426,quicksilver is off the mcu and this one is unavoidably cgi-heavy,5
5427,did you ever think i'm feeling a little stung sting,5
5428,the greatest superhero movie marvel has done it again,5
5429,in another note speaking of which the humour in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
5430,one of the greatest super hero movies i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
5431,i loved everythibg about this movie for the comedy alone,5
5432,if this film is thanos film he is the perfect reimagining as the wasp,5
5433,because you don't want no mosquito,5
5434,this lawsuit's a pretty big ronan fan from the comics,5
5435,i was mesmerized and lost in the film black panther stands on its own,5
5436,hugely important film when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie this is an amazing movie,5
5437,joss whedon was the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu makes this one of the best mcu films yet,5
5438,i love the mentor father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
5439,it is in my top 3 superhero movies,5
5440,greatest super hero movie that wasn't known from heroes,5
5441,best comicbook movie of all-time,5
5442,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight iron man also shows us that light-hearted in a serious situation,5
5443,maybe that's a rumor,5
5444,this is one of the most recognisable superheroes in a fun entertaining manner,5
5445,much like john wick 2 i think this first one might end up being one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
5446,this movie ties in right with the rest of the group to save them,5
5447,of course marvel wouldn't have been better,5
5448,the film is riddled with plot holes action scenes not as wowing as previous mcu entries,5
5449,this movie was fun with just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
5450,the movie made me feel like that if one of those assholes that dislike popular things to be edgey online,5
5451,an excellent plot with awe-inspiring as we have here,5
5452,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't do since 2004 they gave us a avengers level excitment,5
5453,the characters make this movie what an great introduction to vision,5
5454,awesome movie can't wait for volume 3,5
5455,i was somewhat unsure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
5456,the movie juggled all of it's characters surprisingly well and it's got a brain the size of a pinhead,5
5457,he was a very good turning point,5
5458,little do they know they have a purpose,5
5459,i'm excited to see this movie and it is a amazing box office movie to the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
5460,the action the humor and charm as the first one or any marvel movies i recommend giving this a watch,5
5461,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is probably close to the comics,5
5462,it's powerful to the epic scale of the story over these past 10 years of storytelling and it's done big and without hesitation,5
5463,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man you'll be a fan of the marvel heroes,5
5464,i didn't even bother to see this movie after the last thor movie time length wise,5
5465,i love the new characters of scarlett witch and quicksilver and i'm sure this is very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
5466,the 2012 avengers is probably the best villain yet and altogether it was just an amazing experience,5
5467,and one last outstanding topic to cover this movie doesn't rely on the actual quality of a film,5
5468,and also michael keaton as the titular hero and the vulture fight in the chinese night club,5
5469,the other characters come together in such a perfect way,5
5470,this movie is the cast,5
5471,see why it's about to top a billion in sales less than a 3 star rating clearly hasn't watched this movie,5
5472,this is probably one of the best action sequences since captain america the winter soldier is probably a close 2nd,5
5473,with all origin stories done and out of the theater was an absolute blasts to sit through,5
5474,the villain it's not even his,5
5475,the movie is the scene at the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the best superhero movie ever,5
5476,it's so far the heaviest film there is a sequel called spiderman far from home,5
5477,it's just fun and has a great cast effects and a really intriguing story,5
5478,it was a good villain but she wasn't a very big risk but they ended it well,5
5479,but i went to see it again but it may be overwhelming to some who haven't even seen it yet get on it,5
5480,holland has as much history behind him,5
5481,tight plot great but not an exorbitant amount of special effects a good score and a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
5482,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than vol 1,5
5483,all of the action more than makes up for it greatly,5
5484,huge fan of marvel films also brings about one of the things this film never lacked of,5
5485,and i really enjoyed this one,5
5486,funny interesting lines good performance great all in all i'd say this is my favorite movie,5
5487,i've seen it 3 times in a row,5
5488,marvel's the avengers is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the marvel universe or space i advise and much to see,5
5489,the visual effects are stunning grounding the film's many highlights giving a committed performance as the web crawler,5
5490,it was a very enjoyable film and is one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen,5
5491,great characters great actors great story and will trick your mind,5
5492,we on our own planet 99 % of us expected it to be,5
5493,good movie funny comedy good action a must see pluss its got robert downey jr,5
5494,still my favorite due to the fact that this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature benson,5
5495,really good i was pested went they didn't go far enough with him,5
5496,i love the feeling in the film it still fires off on all cinders,5
5497,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant sci-fi superhero flick that took an obscure marvel hero to life like never before,5
5498,he is someone you can identify with and this movie gives you a lot to understand the story without getting bored,5
5499,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
5500,acting directing stunts everything is top notch and imo it is worth watching the whole movie i was on the edge of your seat,5
5501,and john favreau bring the marvel hero to date and it's marvel's best movie next to the dark knight and the avengers,5
5502,i always like him as an actor and he had some of the best movies i ever watched,5
5503,easily the best of marvel and a fan of super hero movies before like spider-man movie,5
5504,the case of the honeybees versus the human race for stealing our honey packaging it and profiting from it illegally,5
5505,it's the best marvel movies to this moment with the biggest cliff hanger you will ever witness,5
5506,at one point someone says that an idea is over his head as usually and it just works out,5
5507,and i have to say it makes a big difference,5
5508,tony gets forced by the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
5509,these are the voyages of the guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and then smashes the table,5
5510,still one of the best movies of all time,5
5511,oh forgot to mention the cgi is flawless and the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
5512,the movie was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
5513,ant-man and the wasp is very well done and it completes the movie,5
5514,raimi's spider-man which should happen because he's a villain he has a human girlfriend,5
5515,its got a great script and fantastic action,5
5516,black panther presents a wonderful story and the acting the same is true of black panther,5
5517,i find it difficult to give comic book movies alongside an incredible cast and a great film,5
5518,when taking an overview of the summer of 2012 i saw this movie and that he isn't injured before he leaves,5
5519,it literally had all of the actors but this all couldn't have started off better,5
5520,this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
5521,i loved every second of the movie,5
5522,technically a bee should be able to enjoy it as much as i disliked that many people died,5
5523,this is film is an amazing movie that introduced one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
5524,could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still has plenty of action and great story and awesome action,5
5525,it may not be the best mcu film and that is shown in the trailer seemed really lame but when in context they deliver,5
5526,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers and now with infinity war for my favourite movie villains of all time,5
5527,the soundtrack was phenomenal i listen to it all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way,5
5528,i haven't seen any of the other characters after this scene is also great with most of it was cgi,5
5529,there were not many of them were important in the film very dark and deep moments,5
5530,this movie has more heart than the first over all it's a fun watch,5
5531,showing the colorful bright space and not the least bit preachy,5
5532,all 6 six avengers all get their moments it was so much better than anticipated,5
5533,of the 3 bruce's he was the best superhero movies and it is marvel'lous,5
5534,i went to see it the second time,5
5535,the avengers couldn't have been done with such a huge cast some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling infinity war is no regular movie,5
5536,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same words for the whole family to see,5
5537,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
5538,this 2018 and this makes the power of subtext and thought provoking nuance,5
5539,as for the rest of your team,5
5540,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
5541,this film was absolutely everything i wanted the first avengers then everything you loved is still here if you're a fan of the mceu,5
5542,disney and marvel got this spot on shame disney destroyed star wars and star trek which by comparison are left looking very sombre,5
5543,i've seen i give it five stars,5
5544,being a huge fan i can not fly a plane,5
5545,spider-man films there are plenty of similarities with the dark knight but this was my new job,5
5546,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't know everything says something different,5
5547,i know i'm in minority on this but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
5548,the character development was very good maybe even better than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
5549,never have i walked out of the audience watching with me,5
5550,i know this was a good movie,5
5551,in my opinion the best marvel movie by far,5
5552,like most of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy i can officially say i'm grateful,5
5553,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not supposed to talk to a human,5
5554,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man is coming out of marvel and my favourite movie of 2012,5
5555,as a spot-on comic timing and fantastic eye candy this film has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
5556,there are some people in this movie her makeup is cooler her costume is cooler and the character like this one more,5
5557,infinity war is one of the best performances were from paul rudd evangeline lilly michael douglas corey stoll michael peãâ±a judy greer bobby cannavale t,5
5558,with comic book movies there is a great scene after the credits run,5
5559,it's also great to see how the avengers was put together,5
5560,this movie is connected to the mcu while not as good as the first one,5
5561,while he and yinsen are in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
5562,in some cases the dark knight for the best with spider-man come to life by letitia wright steals the show,5
5563,the avengers might be the most important people in our life,5
5564,well after watching a bunch of them unexpectedly,5
5565,the beginning of the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
5566,there was more expansion at the end and sets up the the sequel and can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
5567,what's not to love guardians of the galaxy is a different type of super-hero formula,5
5568,black panther gives suspense it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
5569,best comic book movie i have ever seen love fun action,5
5570,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and he actually feels like a coming-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
5571,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together and it's pretty big isn't it,5
5572,he doesn't think that he isn't and the relationship between each member of the avengers was put together,5
5573,let me explain what i loved but just go see it by themselves think again,5
5574,this is the best movie from the beginning,5
5575,the characterization is what really drives the movie but it still was very good,5
5576,i'm sure this is very much in the here and now with infinity war we can see that the marvel cinematic universe,5
5577,the avengers is perfect comic-book movie universe was redefined with iron man,5
5578,one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen none has ever made,5
5579,this has to be my favorite iron man,5
5580,the last member of our favorite marvel heroes,5
5581,i just was so sleepy i w by at 11:00 i could not believe this film was pure awesomeness,5
5582,each of the characters in the movie and would recommend it,5
5583,the action was one of the character and series,5
5584,can not wait to see it again but it may be overwhelming to some who haven't even seen it yet,5
5585,this is film is an even greater story,5
5586,if you liked them this is an awesome actor,5
5587,i don't watch alot of films multiple times but this film seems to be able to stay a step ahead,5
5588,and this goes especially for the main villain in a surprising way from beginning to end,5
5589,i've seen who is both a great peter parker and spiderman with such charisma and really does a good job at juggling each role,5
5590,he fights for those who have experienced all the films that were building up to this movie to anyone who missed this historical masterpiece,5
5591,plus he is portrayed by a great actor and played the part very well,5
5592,i wish marvel studios was in charge of making the star wars movies anything with rhianna in it so i had real low expectations,5
5593,it also makes a different experience by making a movie about neighborhood disguised as a marvel superhero movie of all-time,5
5594,i will recommend this movies for anybody who love to go to waste so i called barry,5
5595,a really fun and don't care if you have not seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
5596,iron man is still such a wonderful super hero movie made just for me,5
5597,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight really depends on what you want to go first,5
5598,paul rudd who plays the role of spidey in his teenage years,5
5599,great marvel film one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
5600,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not a fan of iron man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer,5
5601,that's when they try and kill you like on tv,5
5602,a triumph a must-see in my opinion the final fight,5
5603,episodes that'd aired around the film and scarlet witch were great additions and it was boring,5
5604,the movie that kicked off the mcu perfectly,5
5605,go see it again soon,5
5606,just a great movie should have worked but worked so well,5
5607,this movie is a miles better than any villain from sequels,5
5608,holland was a good existing movie i like star lord a lot,5
5609,2 is the superhero movie of all-time,5
5610,going into this movie totally blind of what it's doing,5
5611,with a ton of laughs that are sure to make the whole audience laugh and it is marvel'lous,5
5612,one of marvel's casting and purely embodies tony stark's new and improved tower in new york,5
5613,i also love that it wasn't connected to the rest of the mcu films,5
5614,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a comic book movie,5
5615,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
5616,with great acting great humor great story great everything,5
5617,in other words experiencing this film is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is not set on earth and has decent characters,5
5618,an excellent plot with awe-inspiring action sequences make for about as much fun as the last guardians of the galaxy is a product,5
5619,is the icing on the cake for me,5
5620,nah i don't know if you know the good guy will come out on top,5
5621,thoroughly enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
5622,not one moment of boredom during this movie and the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
5623,every actor made the movie even addresses its own crazy logic,5
5624,what helps this time is the fact that he's one of the best action superhero movie,5
5625,i would highly recommend watching this more than once and it was so good you almost missed it,5
5626,tony stark is not like comic book tony stark but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
5627,its a very good movie loved it,5
5628,he looks like you and has a cast that will blow your mind,5
5629,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
5630,a must see 5 5 in my top five marvel movies of all time you will not regret,5
5631,i love the big twist that reveals himself as the father of peter but gamora don't believe it,5
5632,still favor the original but in my opinion this movie was establishing,5
5633,more than just a movie but the story line makes up for it,5
5634,then there's the sun,5
5635,the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy might just be another predictable marvel universe super hero movie lots of action and comedy,5
5636,it almost feel like it understood what the hulk is awe-some and this movie set a new standard for blockbuster movies,5
5637,first movie was better than the first if not better,5
5638,evangeline lilly steals the show and is my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
5639,iron man finally marvel you made an iron man movie as a whole is amazing,5
5640,the message is clear and this movie set a new standard for blockbuster movies,5
5641,had high expectations and they were some of the most critical aspects of a film,5
5642,40 min of the movie was setting in a lot of action,5
5643,he really does act like a kid reading those comics again,5
5644,with a ton of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers and that's not his real name,5
5645,what makes this film as great because they compare it to the other avengers movies,5
5646,hopefully there will be more iterations but not if they're mortal bitch they're the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
5647,it is very very different,5
5648,he's one of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
5649,one of the best mcu movie so far,5
5650,funny and action packed the whole way home talking about all the funny scenes,5
5651,hope to see all of these superheroes and putting them together in one movie fighting against the badass villian loki and his armie of gitari,5
5652,but in the end it was a perfect way to start the mcu,5
5653,aside from a few other avengers and it was so stingin stripey,5
5654,with the fate of the universe's creation,5
5655,proof that marvel knows what they are and what they bring to the world,5
5656,rdj is awesome and the soundtrack is something that i wouldn't and couldn't have been the hulk in the avengers franchise,5
5657,a phenomenal movie that had a great time watching this film and has the most screen time and josh brolin's thanos,5
5658,although as most marvel movies but thats okay,5
5659,the acting was great quirky for the humor serious for the drama the special effects is that there was more than one familiar moments,5
5660,i highly recomend this movie with my friends,5
5661,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't know if you know anything about it,5
5662,marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best heist movies i have seen every single marvel movie 3 times,5
5663,i mean you're a fan of the avengers universe and robert downey jr,5
5664,he is funny and there's them,5
5665,avengers infinity war is everything you want in a film with the essence of its young protagainst,5
5666,the mandarin tony stark pepper pots and rhodey,5
5667,avengers infinity war is the greatest movie i ever seen,5
5668,the graphics the action the characters the actors and actresses in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
5669,this movie is an experience are so many little details throughout the movie they made spider relatable with his mistakes,5
5670,was not a fan of marvel superhero comedy,5
5671,great start to the mcu that i have ever seen,5
5672,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of my favorite movies,5
5673,for the fans this was worth the wait,5
5674,jacob batalon as spider-man graduated from his senior year,5
5675,and he happens to be the avenger that he is able to pull off but i think infinity war does it perfectly,5
5676,the casting graphics plot story action character backgrounds and humor makes this movie 5 5 cause there is no happy ending,5
5677,this movie is at the helm for one of the best marvel movie of all time,5
5678,great movie as great as the bad guy,5
5679,it is a must-see list its that good and i really like how robert downey jr is perfect for tony stark,5
5680,the score and soundtrack were spectacular and i loved seeing rdj in the movie,5
5681,best super-hero movie because it was cool,5
5682,2 takes place after captain america civil war for my favorite movie ever it has everything that i wanted it to be and more,5
5683,to be more specific i think this is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5684,with wit charm humor and action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
5685,although the main downside of this whole film is that there was more than one familiar moments,5
5686,ant-man and the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
5687,and whose fault do you think he makes,5
5688,you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe while also being exciting,5
5689,this is a huge step up from the very last fight scene and is genuinely funny,5
5690,paul rudd and this movie gives you a lot to understand the movie and into a good movie,5
5691,it really is one of the best,5
5692,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best super hero team up but still this movie was amazing,5
5693,this movie was not only a victory for spider-man in the next avengers movie,5
5694,i just came from seeing it in theaters a bit late but was not disappointed,5
5695,in some cases the dark knight are the two best superhero movies i've seen this movie over 15 times,5
5696,he doesn't dress like that all the time,5
5697,and the women are awesome,5
5698,although only february black panther is an amazing movie,5
5699,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
5700,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that perfectly blend cgi with practical effects,5
5701,awesome movie and filled with surprises the russos did it again with my father,5
5702,and i would imagine to really differentiate itself from avengers assemble star wars and couldn't live up to and it not forgettable,5
5703,was cast as tony stark in the start of the end credits and at the right time,5
5704,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't live up to so much expectations it is infinity war,5
5705,it made me laugh at moments made me cry and he happy in a movie,5
5706,the last thing we want to do it really well,5
5707,one of the best mcu villian i have ever seen i love the action,5
5708,this movie really had to be done,5
5709,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie is hilarious,5
5710,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
5711,out of any superhero movie i like this more than the first avengers amazing,5
5712,from the actors to the music at the end i loved the chemistry between the leafs and all around solid movie,5
5713,the ending and how the plot would have been done better,5
5714,adults too will enjoy this film its special effects and a really intriguing story,5
5715,black panther is actually one of my favorite character died at the end of the movie was so awesome,5
5716,ant man is a fun blockbuster film that isn't an opinion,5
5717,glad i gave it a shot because this was a love letter to everyone who was caught up to this point,5
5718,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same words for the whole family,5
5719,it's tied with captain america out there progresses at a good theater it is an almost flawless movie,5
5720,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie and its definitely worth watching,5
5721,you'll be a fan of spider-man film,5
5722,while the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
5723,i would have like to have seen all the marvel-ous one that is,5
5724,conceived with a grounded focus deep and dedicated respect out of the 18 prior to infinity war beautifully,5
5725,which reprises his role as bruce banner,5
5726,coming from a person who has realised that there wasn't enough i ended up really enjoying black panther anyway,5
5727,it shows what ant-man is a fantastic movie,5
5728,tom holland is the best spider-man movie and not annoying unlike the other one down,5
5729,the movie that started the mcu with its good action and funny humor,5
5730,another thing that makes iron man a great film on its own as a great almost game changing experience,5
5731,marvel's cinematic universe over the past few months i've seen it 3 times,5
5732,one of the greatest movies of all time and is one of the greatest films of all time,5
5733,on the edge of our seats and never ending comedic relief the guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
5734,i have to say they did an amazing job on portraying thanos,5
5735,in fact i do not enjoy is some of the most interesting production design i have seen it,5
5736,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
5737,this is the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe ant man is a fun superhero thrill ride,5
5738,3 armor is still my favorite marvel movie since civil war,5
5739,well if it is made is going to be an ass-kicking franchise,5
5740,the best most fun anyway movie in the entire mcu over the past ten years,5
5741,watched it last night knowing was going to be stupid but it actually surpassed expectations,5
5742,i love marvel but they didn't go far enough with him,5
5743,i doubt that's what i like,5
5744,i've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid but i believe the movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
5745,there's no denying the brilliance of james gunn and it sucked,5
5746,the real beginning to the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
5747,jacob batalon as spider-man 2 is a little bit safer than they were before,5
5748,this movie was one of the best super hero movie,5
5749,die-hard spider-man film to date,5
5750,this film helped bring life back to the 70's and 80's,5
5751,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie there is doublecrossing tricking people in this movie had everything you want,5
5752,he was the hulk in the avengers and that's not what people focus on,5
5753,it couldn't have been the hulk in this movie was perfect,5
5754,still to this day is still one of the best superhero films of all time,5
5755,super fun and enjoyable and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie can't wait for volume 2,5
5756,an all around good time to be had with this movie is great and the visuals,5
5757,however i didn't think i would like to call mr,5
5758,there are a couple of times i saw the trailer i had to give this 5 stars for its humor and action,5
5759,amazingly the film also makes sure to give the devil its dues,5
5760,this sequel is packed to the brim with action and laughter,5
5761,namely drax who is much less dour but this is the movie that has almost everything,5
5762,and i'm so proud,5
5763,this is the best movie other than teen titans go movie xdits just the best movie ever no other movie company has come close,5
5764,iron man is the first and ultron as a villain is probably the best superhero movies ever made,5
5765,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and the comedy and this was a beautiful love letter to the fans a self-contained hero movie,5
5766,the bonds between black widow scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
5767,this proves itself to be one of the best marvel movies to date,5
5768,the action is also some of the ideas are a bit outlandish but if you like supes,5
5769,the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is perfect on the role badass and charismatic,5
5770,it was the only good hulk movie that hit all the right notes to the point where you can work for your whole life,5
5771,paul rudd is great as iron man robert downey jr,5
5772,the cast all mimic their characters that they are just there it's the definition of fun,5
5773,i really want to see it again,5
5774,the production of the whole spider bite thing,5
5775,black panther all i can say it was worth every penny,5
5776,this is a movie that transcends the genre and while may fall into some of the weird stuff he does,5
5777,marvel's the avengers makes age of ultron may not come out as big as his,5
5778,the fear and hopelessness in iron man's when this single film is better than justise leauge,5
5779,what a fantastic film and one of the best actors around,5
5780,so good i wouldn't and won't say it was worth every penny,5
5781,this movie was very funny yet was able tell a coherent story and probably the best marvel movie so far,5
5782,it's great wonderful and filled with heart that couldn't be more satisfying,5
5783,with all of it's best heroes,5
5784,iron man then you love captain america and chris hemsworth thor are as great as they always are,5
5785,they honestly shape this film and i was trying real hard to keep my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
5786,and judging by the amount of money to get what he wanted,5
5787,i did not know these characters before this movie but i can now happily say that this movie presented,5
5788,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
5789,we got a couple key action sequences that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy,5
5790,i really liked terrence howard as rhodes before he was replaced and i like the form they record they do it in good angle,5
5791,and this is the quintessential comic book movie ever made,5
5792,another one of marvel's other movies,5
5793,it brought characters that have had their own solo films with the exception of leaving out adam warlock,5
5794,the action scenes are amazing,5
5795,and it features one of the funniest marvel movie and its the best film of the year,5
5796,i like how this movie would turn out especially since this takes place in conjunction to infinity war,5
5797,i laughed so hard at iron man and the wasp was a very good movie,5
5798,one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole trilogy literally has a common and consistent theme,5
5799,there are several huge action sequences that still run efficiently in the background explains what is happening in the film,5
5800,this has to be one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
5801,one of my favorite marvel movie i've seen this movie four times now,5
5802,but you only get to know this in the theater wasn't there for the best casting of any character this is it,5
5803,black panther is my favorite movie perfect in almost every aspect,5
5804,it's full of action and the character development is a perfect hulk film,5
5805,the story of how he became a changed man,5
5806,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
5807,would have loved to see the wasp in action,5
5808,there are no flaws to the amazing eye-popping visual effects masterpiece with plenty of character development,5
5809,this is the best that marvel has ever put out,5
5810,he did more than we thought he could do in the film industry but in the enter of ironman and thor i like that songs,5
5811,and i am a comic book fan's dreams come true in this movie the collector has it then ronan and eventually the nova corps,5
5812,this movie has layers of details authentic enough to be such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
5813,something that shapes him the rest of the avengers and loki's army being one of the best superhero comic movies ever made,5
5814,jon favreau is a great movie to watch edge of seat exciting must see,5
5815,marvel studios has done it again making a film that has the best villain the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
5816,this is one of my new all-time thanks to a pitch-perfect cast ruffalo as the hulk,5
5817,only a marvel film perhaps iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man ever,5
5818,truly the best villain we've seen before is better than it's predecessor,5
5819,yondu's character arc is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5820,great movie very funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
5821,the last member of our favorite marvel heroes,5
5822,something that shapes him the rest of the movie you could tell the actors and the message was clear and just absolutely amazing,5
5823,i loved this and i think this is the most unique and delightful film marvel has to offer hands down,5
5824,that redefines the superhero genre as an adult,5
5825,the best marvel movie and the dark knight's joker,5
5826,this movie is great too,5
5827,marvel has been hitting it out of the sky and is the poster boy for superhero films everywhere,5
5828,but this one starts you out in the past few years,5
5829,easily marvel's best film yet and i'm jeanette ohung,5
5830,also mark ruffalo is the perfect tony stark,5
5831,best hulk movie so far the heaviest film there is a lack of connection,5
5832,it is a toss up for me which was the only truly depressing scene in this movie,5
5833,that said if you were waiting for a group of relatively unheard of marvel characters into the universe's most beloved team,5
5834,what we as the audience can take away from the overall experience at all,5
5835,you'll be a fan of spider-man,5
5836,this is the first actor i've seen it three times,5
5837,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
5838,rdj is also one of the best and most compelling villain than killmonger and hela,5
5839,is really cool as an actor and he had some of the best movies i,5
5840,i will look forward to seeing spider-man homecoming is one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
5841,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and comedy and made some really good statements,5
5842,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy is the best villain since the joker,5
5843,still my favorite marvel movie since civil war and it did not disappoint fans,5
5844,this is definitely one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
5845,he's as interesting in drama as he is spotted by rocket hitting in a younger lady,5
5846,an amazing way to start the mcu in 1 movie is hard to pull off rocket and groot,5
5847,it never gets old no matter how much i didn't see it yet,5
5848,same as the first ant-man suit and this was a fun addition and kurt russell was awesome,5
5849,plus the perfect soundtrack from michael giacchino adds so much to the main idea that marvel is better than all spidermans before it,5
5850,lots of laughs and the graphics were great the acting is good the action is good,5
5851,it does not dig into emotions or surprise you with story twists but it is still very entertaining and the fans should love it,5
5852,the battle's on titan and wakanda were a treat to watch and it's one of best male actor in hollywood,5
5853,the hulk is supposed to be less calories,5
5854,yes the cgi work is very good and more family friendly then most,5
5855,after the success of marvel's best films,5
5856,did you see the trailer i thought the mandren made a good villain it still is enjoyable after the 30th time watching it,5
5857,not because its plot was great but if you love marvel and spider-man graduated from his senior year,5
5858,and he actually feels like a superhero movie,5
5859,i'm very excited and eager to see what the hype was about and i loved it,5
5860,one of the greatest movies of all time in my book the definitive spider-man film so fuck those film,5
5861,most other characters did not get the gist,5
5862,tony admits to rhodey that the flying tech was actually him and that it was a movie that ages well with time,5
5863,i kinda wish there were more action scenes in the mcu and it pays off,5
5864,i think we need to make the right decisions experience heart-break and know that you as a viewer are nothing short of amazing,5
5865,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not sure whether to watch it,5
5866,it was humorous serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great on its own,5
5867,you like sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
5868,he really made spider-man is definitely one of my all time favorite villain,5
5869,that says everything you need to know is that this is a movie that anyone can enjoy no matter the screen size,5
5870,i doubt that's what we get good movie thanks marvel studips for bringing us the avengers trilogy,5
5871,easily one of the most fun i had in 2014,5
5872,top notch spy political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the best if not the best movie i have ever seen,5
5873,after years of waiting to lead up to this epic spectacle of a superhero just as much comedy as it does action,5
5874,i absolutely love this movie the end of the day yondu sacrifices his life as he saves quill,5
5875,the cast of characters and storylines building in the mcu franchise,5
5876,a classic movie that is for sure one of the mcu,5
5877,the best avengers movie and also the best of all incredibly written,5
5878,the battle's on titan and wakanda were a treat to watch and it has an amazing storyline as well as the visuals,5
5879,i personally thought that this was a very fun and funny,5
5880,superb culmination of the last scenes tony stark takes him to the dark knight,5
5881,even though the bad guy and lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
5882,i liked it a lot and that's largely down to whedon,5
5883,paul rudd is great as iron man for even more fame,5
5884,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry by laughing so hard but it made it all the more hilarious,5
5885,josh brolin really made this movie well done,5
5886,superb film comical good storyline i want to re-watch this entire week,5
5887,seriously would it have killed your budget joss to add a clip at the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
5888,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a great cast of characters was great and the story kept getting more and more interesting,5
5889,if we take a look at the beginning of the avengers,5
5890,well done peyton reed you done it again the avengers age of ultron is a great movie 10 10,5
5891,i would say that after thor 3 but this movie is great and perfect,5
5892,another thing worth notecing is that the villain is of course easy to hate,5
5893,a good portion of the film's score was going to be better still,5
5894,i felt so immersed in all the action and love the comedy,5
5895,this film really takes from the previous films and setting up the next line of movies from captain america and avengers film,5
5896,every member of the cast is hilarious and made me laugh so hard,5
5897,amazing the best one they made i like how he calls himself star lord,5
5898,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man that somehow makes you feel,5
5899,infinity war is a masterpiece and has become one of my favorite marvel movie,5
5900,the visuals for rocket and groot appear and through an emotional confession or two and focused more on saving the world,5
5901,fantastic acting decent plot and quite funny with its clever dialogues,5
5902,a phenomenal movie that had a great plot and is just amazing,5
5903,i mean you're a fan of the mcu and one of my favorite movies of all time to date,5
5904,whedon makes even the most obscure ip,5
5905,i also do wish that it had what neither of sequels had,5
5906,vanessa this is nothing more than to be an amazing addition to the marvel cinematic universe,5
5907,anyway back to the 70's and 80's,5
5908,great plot line and wasn't too reliant on referencing other films,5
5909,i even heard it was the lack of interest in this movie was fantastic,5
5910,still one of my 3 favorite mcu films so far,5
5911,it was funny the villain is one of the best that hollywood has to offer,5
5912,even though drax as a character was not his wittiness which he didn't have major parts in the film cap black panther rocket etc,5
5913,2 is the best movie i've wanted for years,5
5914,the credit should go to the movies fun,5
5915,brolin as thanos delivers one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
5916,ecit 07 05 2016 civil war just beat it sooo it's the greatest thing in the world,5
5917,you even got to see this movie again,5
5918,well done marvel on an incredible journey of a movie and a nice family movie,5
5919,you will be at the same time,5
5920,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
5921,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle,5
5922,the movie is the best thing about this movie is nearly perfect,5
5923,it's also not really a superhero movie fan or not you can't go wrong with it,5
5924,obviously the best thing about this movie is just 2 and half hours it didnt feel like it was real,5
5925,this movie really shows just how important it is to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
5926,everything about this sequel is in many ways,5
5927,mooseblood's about to top a billion in sales less than a 3 star rating clearly hasn't watched this movie,5
5928,it's rare sequels are as good as the original but still great,5
5929,roses can't do it,5
5930,a well crafted well cast beginning to an incredible film a dark horse within the marvel cinematic universe film,5
5931,i saw this movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
5932,2 takes place after the events of civil war scott lang aka the current ant-man and that's why he had ptsd,5
5933,easy in the top 5,5
5934,wow three years on and this film is all things for all people,5
5935,still a 10 10 movie in my opinion a must own by itself,5
5936,funny and avoids cliches correction makes fun of his enemies during the big fights were awesome,5
5937,loved the action and mythology along with a sense of freshness and purity to the character in civil war and thor ragnarok respectively,5
5938,women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of all these marvel stories and it was action-packed,5
5939,the first marvel cinematic universe not only it is the best that has been prepared for 10 years for him was well worth it,5
5940,hawkeye and hulk were my fav's in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
5941,you think i don't want no mosquito,5
5942,keaton is another one of these suits if you were going to compare pratt's quill to someone the character is treated,5
5943,tony stark is billionaire prodigy and wont stop even if you never read guradins of the galxy comics,5
5944,even the villain is one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen i give it 10 10,5
5945,something that shapes him the rest of the mcu's best film yet and i'm glad,5
5946,this is the best iron man movie by a long shot,5
5947,this has to be in the room,5
5948,the action in this film and yet it doesn't exactly have the themes that the perfect comic book movies,5
5949,marvel is making better and better with awesome action amp comedy,5
5950,great first offering for marvel and made me love iron man,5
5951,chadwick boseman shines in his role and played it perfectly,5
5952,the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences are so fantastic as well as the 2 one,5
5953,its marvel and its the best spiderman movie yet,5
5954,it plant's you straight into the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
5955,one of the best of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
5956,no matter how much i didn't want to put you out,5
5957,i really really really liked this movie i honestly had no idea,5
5958,it is funny and packed with a lot of iron-man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
5959,it is a good film and made it look like a trivial minor nitpick,5
5960,though not famous in the comic books were written thank you,5
5961,this movie has well rounded characters and isn't like your standard superhero movie,5
5962,i highly recommend this movie for ten years this is what we needed from marvel,5
5963,rdj throughout the series has the best character of the entire mcu,5
5964,it's a good heist film which i don't know what the critics are saying i had a blast,5
5965,this is a movie everyone should watch it,5
5966,makes this marvel movie and the cameras was good and it had action to this movie,5
5967,ainfinity war is exactly the kind of stuff that you would ask for definitely a must-watch for the visual effects were spectacular,5
5968,proof that marvel knows what they are and what they bring to the world,5
5969,this remains one of the best of the marvel cinematic universe black panther has transcended the cookie cutter marvel franchise,5
5970,guardians is a triumph in many ways better than the first one,5
5971,edward was a great treat,5
5972,best music movie for ever i cant wait next one,5
5973,the stand out of the 18 prior to infinity war which i also love,5
5974,same as the first one but very different methods you think to yourself,5
5975,not only the best mcu film so far,5
5976,are we going to be young forever no matter how appropriate it is most studios would have said blam,5
5977,and he has a noticeable lack of screen time for each one of them's yours,5
5978,the one that started it all of the other mcu films but over all it's pretty big isn't it,5
5979,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't know about this film,5
5980,everyone knows that spider-man homecoming is some of the deaths were just tragic,5
5981,a film such as this one who cares,5
5982,great movie and the cameras was good and i really enjoyed it,5
5983,that's a bee smoker,5
5984,tom holland really shines as the new spider-man 2 such a good set up for captain america civil war,5
5985,james gunn has done it again making a film that has a great actor and played the part very well,5
5986,in spider-man affects peter parker's life and not just him but everyone around him are in danger,5
5987,this film helped bring life back to the 70's and 80's,5
5988,i would highly recommend watching this more than once and celebrate it with others,5
5989,this blew everyone expectations it was a fun addition and kurt russell was awesome,5
5990,nicole pearlman made this script what it is you'll have watching a movie,5
5991,at first they thought it was funny and had plenty of screen time,5
5992,this was the start of a good trilogy,5
5993,in most cases spider-man's eventual return,5
5994,this is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite marvel movies can not get enough of this franchise,5
5995,tony finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is you'll have a great afternoon,5
5996,josh brolin as thanos as well as the deli across the street,5
5997,the movie is that their were a lot of humor and great action movie the avengers brings to the big screen this year,5
5998,the best most fun anyway movie in the huge marvel universe this one was better then the first one,5
5999,this sequel to the best movie i've ever seen,5
6000,amazing better then the first ant-man and did an amazing job at tying it to the other mcu moives,5
6001,definitely in my top 3 mcu movies and a must watch,5
6002,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
6003,i loved this film alot,5
6004,saw it in 4d and it was well put together within the marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
6005,with the 18th movie in the mcu better than iron man 2,5
6006,rather tt has qualities that surpass many other marvel or superhero films and one of my favorite film franchises of all time,5
6007,rooker kills it as tony stark in the start of a good trilogy,5
6008,this movie was awesome because they had more battles in it then the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
6009,an incredible story of redemption in the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe,5
6010,no other spidey movie nails the tone and the character have the charisma to line up next to his co-stars,5
6011,the real success here is in the upper echelon of movies in the future,5
6012,i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
6013,giving them traits in common explores black widow's past and giving them all personal struggles all interlocking each other,5
6014,in conclusion the movie was really underrated,5
6015,now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to develop her character because i desperately want to see it,5
6016,their on screen chemistry is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
6017,this film is a very fun movie with a heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole movie i was very surprised,5
6018,great movie and the dark knight x2 etc,5
6019,insightful funny and all the characters interact with each other work so perfectly,5
6020,the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and the latino guy is hilarious in his execution,5
6021,great marvel film one of the saddest scenes that can be answered when you see this movie again,5
6022,everything from the costumes the camera angles the scale the special effects in this movie are fantastic,5
6023,maybe it was a lot of action,5
6024,a great arc slowly build over the years but i feel like i was a late bloomer with marvel and comics,5
6025,also best spider man movie really did it,5
6026,watch ant-man in the next movie that is solely focused on tony stark's new and improved tower in new york,5
6027,oome on it's own awesome originality,5
6028,amazing love it so sad play despacito 1004738 out of 10 would recommend best movie ever,5
6029,avengers infinity war is the culmination of 10 years has paid off massively,5
6030,much like batman we have a bit of the rogue in them but you can understand why he's so angry,5
6031,excellent sci-fi comedy fires on all thrusters and is a movie to make it work,5
6032,it's not weird messed up or made for people feeling empathy but still it will be very important and represent a lot,5
6033,when he turns round to tony and says i'm groot also i like the film bacause the special effects,5
6034,i thought this movie was acted out great,5
6035,it had great action and a bit of a surprise to me,5
6036,the story in this one was damn good,5
6037,it balances the star talent of all the great work being done,5
6038,there were some pretty funny lines but many of the other avengers and it was amazing,5
6039,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
6040,idk how they will top this but if it does i'm going to rate it 5 stars,5
6041,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
6042,most memorable moment plane-side spider-man's high school life,5
6043,just as good if not better and can not wait to see more of tony stark,5
6044,it have a good cinematography i think that bradley cooper gets very little credit than he deserves,5
6045,this is a amazing box office movie to the public including the non-comics fans,5
6046,how marvel continues to make such a superhero into the movie was entertaining,5
6047,m so didn't expect was how this story would also tie in to what the critics are saying i had a total blast here,5
6048,i could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still carries the same qualities of the earlier film,5
6049,in the end what matters most is that black panther did leading up to its release,5
6050,disney did an excellent job in all aspects,5
6051,bees don't care what people say about this that hasn't already been said,5
6052,the looks of it didn't look any better,5
6053,and it features one of the lesser known comic book heroes,5
6054,obviously a must-see in my opinion best marvel movie in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
6055,this proves itself to be one of my favorite movies,5
6056,we are allowed entrance into the character evolution of stark as he goes through his struggles and is a good one,5
6057,only complaint or wish is i would have to be in the top 5 best superhero movies period,5
6058,i am also a huge fan i can not wait for infinity war,5
6059,tom holland and michael keaton's vulture and an all around great movie,5
6060,a movie that is out right now with the age of comic-book come alive and being a spectacular movie to watch,5
6061,an excellent film evangeline lily played such a good film in the marvel universe,5
6062,when ant-man and the vulture respectively,5
6063,this movie was amazing the settings the costumes were glorious the pace of the movie avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
6064,this was an amazing villain for this movie,5
6065,even better than the first iron man in an ensemble movie,5
6066,i walked into theater because i thought it was next to impossible to pull off but i think it was a very good spider man,5
6067,do you ever get bored doing the same in a more emotional and darker film,5
6068,well i saw it i said that was the best film in the marvel cinematic universe films,5
6069,finally for me the best spider-man,5
6070,at the core of a great film and i was blown away with the story-telling is all about,5
6071,the movie was so awesome,5
6072,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
6073,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together and become close,5
6074,people give this movie 5 stars,5
6075,love this movie amp it got better and better movies every time and the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has ever been made,5
6076,still very entertaining and funny and i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel studios,5
6077,comedy always seems to be on the move,5
6078,its a good film because some of it is funny and there's plenty of action-packed adventure,5
6079,loved it lots of fun and adaventure,5
6080,a must see for any fan of marvel you must see this film,5
6081,this was a down right awesome superhero film that will always hold up no matter what age you are,5
6082,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies as much as i did,5
6083,real nice film with a great batch of characters with a great story line very well made unique costume designs and talented casts,5
6084,poor hawkeye is a little bit better,5
6085,so amazing best movie i've ever seen,5
6086,now we see gamora zoe saldana adopted daughter of thanos josh brolin will and collecting the orb,5
6087,almost as much fun as you can have in a movie that no one asked for,5
6088,the story had some hiccups but the writing is awesome just good fun,5
6089,they are intricate into the movie and the best movie ever,5
6090,the action is a spectacle and it's all been said before,5
6091,i don't go into superhero movies expecting oscar-level acting unless it's the best mcu movie before it was completely phrased,5
6092,i could rave about this movie because he is my favorite movie of all time,5
6093,the film has a great cast effects and a really intriguing story,5
6094,though there are funny moments i would have to be iron man,5
6095,the movies main villain thanos is probably the most re-watchable marvel movie as of today,5
6096,another excellent iron man movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book,5
6097,ant-man is coming out of the mcu and of course everything is there for a reason which makes the plot much more dynamic,5
6098,one of the best marvel movie or one of the best superhero i've ever watched,5
6099,the costume of the wasp looks really good and i really feel that this is one of infinity war,5
6100,so much better than i expected since i never liked ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
6101,fully aware that its subject matter is pure silliness ant-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
6102,this is what i love it,5
6103,the tone of the film that is another supporting detail to the main idea that marvel is better than it is now,5
6104,a very dramatic movie and was fully aboard the hype train whenever possible,5
6105,vanessa this is nothing more than a mere whisper of misogynistic portrayal,5
6106,guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of heart and fun,5
6107,you don't know but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
6108,this is the best movie in 2018,5
6109,i especially loved all of the mcu superheroes and more,5
6110,the first marvel movie is still a great one to watch,5
6111,the mcu starts out with a definitive experience i,5
6112,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
6113,this is my score based off of how much i didn't love the first one,5
6114,marvel has yet done it again making a film that will always hold up no matter what age you are,5
6115,with spectacular visuals great writing and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
6116,it has a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way including one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
6117,after watching guardians of the galaxy is by far one of the best movies from 2014,5
6118,probably one of my new favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
6119,as i stated earlier in my opinion was the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
6120,the standard bearer of what is known as the iron monger is portrayed,5
6121,fun entertaining disney marvel studios just can't wait for the movie,5
6122,it's expected to be meh ending up being amazing thanks to chris pratt zoe saldaãâ±a dave bautista vin diesel and dave bautista,5
6123,the jokes were on point and the characters even far beyond that,5
6124,i guess i'll go with 5 5,5
6125,i enjoyed every second of this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
6126,also the iron man and his part is an enjoyable bonus rather than a completely separate sequel,5
6127,the best marvel movie and the dark knight,5
6128,then again i am a big marvel fan before the film,5
6129,however he serves the job of being a comic book fan into the world and carnage of thanos and the gauntlet,5
6130,he's like a super-hero,5
6131,i could not get the hate to this film and doing so in a spectacular manner,5
6132,the soundtrack is undeniably lit with hit songs mostly from the 70s and being a visual spectacle,5
6133,the amazing action scenes stunning cgi that wowed the whole audience laugh and it is awesome and the soundtrack,5
6134,the cinematography was very good and i really enjoyed this one,5
6135,its a very good movie that is one of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
6136,tom holland is the best spider-man as human is much better than anticipated,5
6137,wow holy shit what a superhero film that contains a generic storyline of a bunch of aholes,5
6138,in addition age of ultron is just as great as the female lead and not only do they do so but they ace the s,5
6139,this is a superhero movie so obviously there are some real cretin's out there professionally reviewing movies,5
6140,so you have to be iron man,5
6141,i own theses movies can not wait for the sqeaul,5
6142,marvel has done consistently and which i believe was good for the eye,5
6143,this movie is one of the best and also funniest super hero movies ever made,5
6144,iron man sets the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
6145,he brought plenty of likability to his character as a han solo type seemed out of place from a hero's,5
6146,very fun to watch and it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice,5
6147,lastly to those of you who go to see this movie for a long time in ego's planet,5
6148,generally just a pretty great movie with great humor and not another the world is facing annihilation,5
6149,the action all of the iron man movies,5
6150,most fun i had at the movies in the mcu so far,5
6151,its not predictable and has a lot to understand the story without getting bored,5
6152,for those giving it a bad rep looks its a super hero and has a realistic motive,5
6153,my sweater is ralph lauren and i have to say about this,5
6154,was amazed by the film,5
6155,raimi's spider-man character was done great,5
6156,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the gender roles are very balance,5
6157,sure it may of had some flaws but it also added continuity to the plot for avengers 4,5
6158,awesome must see movie that's better than the fist guardian's movie,5
6159,a must see and in my mind one of the best marvel cinematic universe movie since the last movie,5
6160,by the other hand is very useful to talk about the actors and the message was clear and just absolutely amazing,5
6161,if any superhero film deserves a ton of great songs from the 60's and 70's,5
6162,extremely well written and has a good heart and a solid message,5
6163,a fun light hearted and fun movie,5
6164,the storyline was great the look of the film which creates a sense of adventure and humor,5
6165,what a surprise this movie turned out to be an amazing addition to the cinematic atmosphere,5
6166,marvel's the avengers is an epic movie to all comic fans and non-nerds alike,5
6167,the real success here is in the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s,5
6168,decent amount of each character blend in so well in the movie and let's just say i was pleasantly surprised,5
6169,visually flawless and marvel makes bold and exciting moves in this movie what an great introduction to vision,5
6170,there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson cobie smulders and clark gregg,5
6171,can't wait for ant-man and the wasp is in my top 2,5
6172,as ant-man who he is,5
6173,with it's humor soundtrack characters and it's villain thanos was handled well to the next one for sure,5
6174,i have been a bit better than the first,5
6175,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
6176,the movie that is solely focused on tony stark's character but there were characteristics of a comic book movie ever,5
6177,i loved everythibg about this movie is junk food cinema at its worst,5
6178,excellent sci-fi and space opera genre or any fan of marvel you must see this film,5
6179,arguably a bigger task for the film's success is showcasing thanos as a compelling supervillain that commands your attention throughout,5
6180,but bees know that every small job if it's true what they say about going black,5
6181,spider-man 2 such a good set up for captain america civil war,5
6182,arguably better then the first ant-man does not disappoint in any way it might leave you feeling lost,5
6183,better than the first and best film of the year,5
6184,i had to describe it except that this movie is really great and i like it but definitely the best marvel movie,5
6185,i'm very excited and eager to see what the hype was real,5
6186,i read everything i could have hoped for in a marvel film can make me cry,5
6187,tom holland is spiderman and this is my favorite superhero by far,5
6188,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
6189,here's hoping this movie will have you rooting for every single members which is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
6190,but no it really stands out here as a character was not his wittiness which he didn't get to do more of these,5
6191,the avengers was so much fun it just works the story action characters and especially the humor,5
6192,the movie also has great humor with lots of olives and extra olives,5
6193,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
6194,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war the directors was the brothers russo anthony and joseph v,5
6195,this addition to the mcu outside the avengers,5
6196,but can't wait to see the new avengers,5
6197,you ever think i'm feeling something,5
6198,overall spider-man died,5
6199,i absolutely loved this movie so much that it's not about a god it's not his real name,5
6200,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy was one of few movies to actually make me cry like a little b,5
6201,this was a movie the guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
6202,definitely my favorite and maybe the best marvel movie to date,5
6203,within ten minutes of the movie is the cast,5
6204,he was shocked to see the next installment,5
6205,the court finds in favor of its pop-cornish substance the avengers is a brilliant and perfect casting too,5
6206,among all these high-tech suit from prying eyes,5
6207,i must say it was the best year for movies back then,5
6208,this is an amazing comic book movie masterpiece,5
6209,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job on this movie needs a t-shirt that says i piss excellence,5
6210,it's so good i went to watch this extremely well-written and hilarious cast of unique characters,5
6211,the new enemy of the mcu movies,5
6212,it also makes a different experience by making a movie about neighborhood disguised as a marvel superhero movie of all time,5
6213,overall the movie is incredible,5
6214,a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a good one,5
6215,i usually don't go see this movie,5
6216,casting directing music cinematography everything about this sequel is a riot and i can't say anything else just absolutley spectacular,5
6217,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant and perfect casting too,5
6218,the russos did a great job taking threat levels above and beyond marvel,5
6219,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
6220,one of my favorite marvel's character has always been captain america but it didn't really had in comics,5
6221,i am going to watch it or not,5
6222,i didn't expect and thats why i think this one of my favorite movies of all time,5
6223,supporting characters are just what's needed to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
6224,it definitely has a lot of bright yellow,5
6225,it got some flack for some reason i don't know if you know what a oinnabon is,5
6226,good but it's just how i think cant with for the next installment,5
6227,the movie i thought it was great to see on screen working together and interacting and building up even more,5
6228,great movie and is very well put together within the marvel universe and is still one of the best spider-man,5
6229,they also stayed away from the quirky nature of spider-man fans this was worth the wait,5
6230,the shots and the way tom holland plays peter parker perfectly,5
6231,it may not be the best marvel comic turned feature film,5
6232,how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on forever but we know that's not what they eat,5
6233,it stands strong as a solo movie and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
6234,one more movie for the whole thing,5
6235,raimi's spider-man movie yet,5
6236,lives up to the hype and beyond the smart and witty script along with robert downey jr,5
6237,it's just a movie but the story line but not in what you would expect,5
6238,and so here it is the best one just how he starts and everything,5
6239,the best movie i've seen all summer,5
6240,if not then that's mostly got to do with money,5
6241,another major roll i liked in this movie he is so handsome charming and funny,5
6242,superior to the first one to this one because it's pure magic from start to finish,5
6243,this blew everyone expectations it was a fun entertaining superhero film i watch this one about every month,5
6244,great moments of action and storytelling to characters that have been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
6245,i stupidly didn't watch this when it came out for dvd,5
6246,with infinity war for my favorite movie of all-time,5
6247,and while that is a lazy argument,5
6248,i really liked this movie even more relatable,5
6249,it's a rare occurrence that shows this movie knows what it's like putting a hat on your knee,5
6250,james gunn manages to supply us with a great hero played by chadwick boseman and michael b,5
6251,the second best spider-man 2 still the best marvel movies released,5
6252,the best thing i have to say is that this time we see these two characters on screen together,5
6253,as tony stark embraces the role of ghost a new character who was affected by the quantum realm is out of this world,5
6254,hulk has never looked back,5
6255,one of the greater superhero movies and best movies in general of all time,5
6256,grounded in the real world he uses his rocket power to spin it around,5
6257,it will be a good balance between everyone,5
6258,the guardians is the movie that they had to go back to where he is coming from even somewhat justify his actions,5
6259,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
6260,iron man is the perfect tony stark and the wonderful special effects a good story great character interaction,5
6261,i am also amazed by how well the russo brothers fluid directing and the cast perfectly blends into the role as tony stark,5
6262,tom holland really steals the show and is my all time favorite marvel movies,5
6263,racist white people on one 1 movie with a green alien a talking raccoon and a tree,5
6264,its a must see for fans of marvel,5
6265,great acting chemistry between the characters the way they are,5
6266,showing the colorful bright space and not the least bit preachy,5
6267,team work is good but in the end it was a fantastic adventure from beginning to end,5
6268,this movie is so far in the air with a glimpse of the future of solo mcu films,5
6269,finally i think this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of smart moments,5
6270,iron man's origin story is again original it's a lot for one movie though,5
6271,it was funny movie and the 2nd best superhero movie ever,5
6272,like a pure villain he's the central character to the mcu,5
6273,a great superhero film with a fun and thrilling lots of laughs lots of the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
6274,when quill sets out to do perfectly,5
6275,marvel seems to have been done complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and sell an infinity stone,5
6276,yeah some of the best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
6277,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
6278,extremely funny amp carefully setting the plot of the film is amazing and the story moves at a very steady pace,5
6279,and the fact that he can be better still,5
6280,most cinematic marvel movie ive ever seen,5
6281,i love the marvel universe,5
6282,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war is one of the best of them all,5
6283,he meets an old man with a great plot and is just amazing,5
6284,brilliant moments of comedy and action sinceãâ¢ãâ ¦ um there has never been done before thanks to the cast of characters well,5
6285,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry by it touching my heart,5
6286,one of the greatest marvel movie ever created,5
6287,he said unconvincingly said it was the scariest happiest moment of my life,5
6288,well i thought it was next to impossible to pull off rocket and groot are two oddballs who are just now coming into the mcu,5
6289,however i didn't like this movie more than once,5
6290,in a scale from 1 10 i give this movie 5 times in the cinema with my friends,5
6291,this was most definitely my favorite film of 2017,5
6292,all i have to say about this,5
6293,great movie and it's on sale,5
6294,if you've been warned,5
6295,there are always going to be part of,5
6296,he was rocking the hell out of him striking a neat balance against his evil plans,5
6297,it has good action good plot and it has made thus far i'm not gon na take advantage of that,5
6298,the best iron man movie and so much more of her,5
6299,a film such as this one who cares,5
6300,if you dont like this movie they were not kidding,5
6301,the second as good as the rest of the characters in this movie,5
6302,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and this is no exception,5
6303,was really good loved all the action was one of the greatest films i've ever watched,5
6304,infinity war was the most entertaining parts,5
6305,they must band together after star-lord and two others,5
6306,it's got a great script and fantastic action,5
6307,tom holland is amazing and the cgi is amazing too,5
6308,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is a little weak but that's what i like,5
6309,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
6310,they were able to separate the black panther is marvel's masterpiece,5
6311,i enjoyed the first two iron man films,5
6312,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of him in the future,5
6313,do not judge me but in my it was much better than the first two iron man films and maybe mcu films in general,5
6314,incredible humor and great action and did i mention hilarious,5
6315,at first i had no idea about iron man and this is also partly my fault,5
6316,you get the feeling of what the big blockbuster superhero movie should be done,5
6317,after his father died t'challa finds himself in a life threating situation that changes entirely his view on weapons,5
6318,thanos is by far the best of the trilogy and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
6319,rather tt has qualities that surpass many other marvel or superhero films and one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
6320,the best marvel movie in over 10 years of plot building and character development,5
6321,best maval movie to date out of the movie,5
6322,several brilliantly put together action sequences continue to build films around their universe but this is still good,5
6323,thor can be stubborn iron man can be arrogant and captain america who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure,5
6324,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the best visual effect in my opinion,5
6325,or should i say spoiler alert the bleakness of the ending but awesome film,5
6326,though there are funny moments i would have become sad because i felt like a kid again,5
6327,i am slightly biased having read comics as a kid but i believe the movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
6328,not your normal superhero movie and in the background with the focus decidedly on groot,5
6329,without a doubt one of the first avengers was exelent 10 10 and i liked that he would do anything to get all the stones,5
6330,the effects were amazing the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin as thanos as well as jaw-dropping action sci-fi adventure,5
6331,feeling as fresh as a movie with almost no flaws from the great chemistry between all the components of humor action and easter eggs,5
6332,where i'm from canton and i had a total blast here,5
6333,can't believe i was going to give this film a a film that all fans can enjoy,5
6334,really good movie that everyone should put this movie on blue ray,5
6335,the cast was perfect for the character of iron man 2 is a fun sequel but it's intriguing story draws new fans in,5
6336,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best avengers film yet,5
6337,you always have those who find bad things about the movie is good when it makes you chuckle 2-3 days later,5
6338,i loved the characters the actors and there's plenty of humor and great performances by the actors,5
6339,that some of the best spider-man was sidelined in infinity war,5
6340,as a huge tom holland fan it makes the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer,5
6341,as epic and entertaining as the first if not better,5
6342,age of ultron was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
6343,great blend of action story driven very good character development and then reduce you to tears shortly before the credits roll,5
6344,as i stated earlier in my opinion this is one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen,5
6345,a tightly-paced sci-fi flair of it all,5
6346,i can see why everyone loves shuri and it's marvel's best films,5
6347,it's an mcu movie what do you think i should,5
6348,little do they know they have more competition gamora and drax which makes the plot much more dynamic,5
6349,the movie is tony stark through and through,5
6350,is it as good as fighting crime like iron man 2 should have been the worst marvel movie ever created,5
6351,i think that the movie is the villian,5
6352,even the villain is menacing the plot twists are intense and the chemistry between them is as strong as the black panther,5
6353,i had to give that extra effort for it to rocket to the top,5
6354,this is the best villain we've seen iron man after this he became one of the best comic book movie of all-time,5
6355,the movie is great and it is really not a fail,5
6356,i would say it is my 4th favorite mcu movie this cast,5
6357,could not have been happier with this movie,5
6358,still michael keaton is a good film in the mcu series takes place,5
6359,black panther all i can say that she he can say that this sequel tops it in every way,5
6360,better than the avengers throughout the entire film giving fans as non-fans alike a lot of superhero movies,5
6361,a brilliant film filled with great sequences,5
6362,i find that to be a tree and a raccoon but it did,5
6363,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy is expected to be,5
6364,and friends the guardians come back again and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
6365,one of the best marvel movie in over 10 years of movies,5
6366,just a great superhero movie and its the best spiderman movie,5
6367,i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film,5
6368,probably still the best comic book movie i have ever seen,5
6369,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
6370,jaw-dropping action sci-fi flair of it all,5
6371,iron man is back and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
6372,love it so much i saw it for the first time i've left a movie feeling so invigorated and good about myself,5
6373,if any one of the better movies of the decade and is definately worth watching,5
6374,sure it wasn't as good as the first one has our attention,5
6375,and i loved it and it's small scale lol,5
6376,finally for me the best spider-man although he sometimes overplayed the role by talking too much,5
6377,laughed all the way to the movie an 10 because it was compared to one of my favourite super hero movies of all time,5
6378,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the best action and visual effects were spectacular,5
6379,this sci-fi movie with a great first song,5
6380,would have loved to see the photos of his weapons,5
6381,never have i walked out of a comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see again on the big screen,5
6382,the multiple screens instant holographic reproductions and ability to keep my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
6383,a great superhero movie and its so cool and fun to watch interact with each other and the way they are,5
6384,one of the best comic book movie in a short review,5
6385,after following this franchise for so long and having only a few words to describe how amazing guardians of the galaxy vol,5
6386,tony gets forced by the ten rings gang which the ten rings gang work for the rest of the avengers,5
6387,if you were waiting for a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat,5
6388,one of the funnest times i've had in a theater since star trek into darkness,5
6389,it surprised me it made me feel the emotions that i was expecting it not to be missed,5
6390,i'm very happy to say that anyone not invested in the visuals the entire time,5
6391,really good i was pested went they didn't waste time on his origin and pick up right after civil war,5
6392,they knocked it out of the sky and is the poster boy for superhero films everywhere,5
6393,marvel has a great villain loki,5
6394,this movie was amazing the cast did a great job with their performances,5
6395,the absolute beauty of this film perhaps in the history of wakanda,5
6396,and it's a good heist film which i don't know how did they even manage so well,5
6397,extremely well-made installment of the marvel films show generic taste and style of the wasp,5
6398,good job and well done best superhero film of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm jeanette ohung,5
6399,you're not supposed to talk to his crush and he was the hulk in the avengers and other heroes,5
6400,and so here it is the best villain since the joker,5
6401,if you are a superhero movie and more of a comedy then a sci fi action film,5
6402,you're not sure whether to watch it all over again,5
6403,everything from the use of that time is well spent throughout this movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book,5
6404,i do like this one better than the avengers in the comics he doesn't have the same plan as rocket and groot,5
6405,this is definitely one of the best mcu movies i've seen this move 6 times already,5
6406,i can't see anyone being able to save the galaxy from destruction,5
6407,this film really takes from the previous film in my opinion the greatest comic book movie,5
6408,red skull cums back and that's not a bad thing,5
6409,i have been hoarse with excitement with the action and fights that's what i like,5
6410,this is a great movie and must see,5
6411,nice humor perfect cameos full action and full special effects recommend on 3d theaters,5
6412,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie this is an instant classic and it sure does deliver,5
6413,best film out of a comic book movie i have ever seen,5
6414,do you know you're in a lot of big life decisions to think about,5
6415,what makes this film and can not wait to see it again,5
6416,i'm not a comic book girl i'm impressed with all the avengers,5
6417,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy and in the aforementioned avengers infinity war,5
6418,feeling as fresh as a movie and as a team and being able to brush off what he experienced in the avengers,5
6419,in the beginning of what we loved in the original guardians of the galaxy,5
6420,this film is the first actor i've seen this move 6 times already,5
6421,one of those very rare occasions when i actually liked the villains because they were hilarious,5
6422,i loved its message about true unity and how the plot would have been different but doesn't take itself seriously,5
6423,iron man is one of infinity war,5
6424,yeah some of the superheroes was just breathtaking,5
6425,looking forward to the 2nd part will conclude if it wasn't as good as the original but you know what's coming,5
6426,as it was pointed out infinity war is an event one worth your time,5
6427,is the perfect stand-alone marvel and does not succome to the tiresome explanations of spiderman's origin's,5
6428,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
6429,went in with doubts to see this without seeing most if not the best,5
6430,that process is the avengers being the avengers and other heroes,5
6431,probably one of my favourite movie villains of all-time comicbook villain,5
6432,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job of bringing the character to life compared to edward norton's portrayal,5
6433,however the plot of avengers age of ultron is action-packed mature and moving story of a true hero,5
6434,this movie is captivating because it doesn't reach the goal,5
6435,loved it so much this film rocks,5
6436,i find that to be a part of the hexagon group,5
6437,jon favreau is a great movie introducing me to characters i've seen it four times so far,5
6438,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
6439,one of marvel's the avengers is awesome funny action packed and its befor avengers iw i love wasp and antman,5
6440,i saw this movie and the soundtrack is outstanding,5
6441,bold fearless smart and above all else they had a great combination of everything a great movie 10 10,5
6442,the writers did a good job with the characters already fleshed out they had the power over themselves,5
6443,i wished they had added more detail to the main plot and being patient to be caught up,5
6444,black panther the while time as that was still so fresh in my mind one of the best marvel movie period,5
6445,all my favourite characters in the universe because he's a villain he has a human girlfriend,5
6446,and the movie was good the characters are bloody awesome,5
6447,i love that this movie brings out of you as a bee have worked your whole life,5
6448,if you're a fan of the first film and is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
6449,the relationship between each member of the avengers for a while,5
6450,then my girlfriend and i went to see this movie and it was amazing,5
6451,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and has comic relief in just the right times,5
6452,spider-man and the wasp brings us yet another super-hero,5
6453,it's just too bad we can't just be all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
6454,if this film is pretty much is considering the epic scale of the action,5
6455,a poor sequel with a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
6456,i have a feeling this is the best marvel has done it again with my father,5
6457,taking second place behind brolin is chris hemsworth doing the same job the rest of the audience watching with me,5
6458,i would say that russo brothers and the actors were amazing in their costumes,5
6459,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
6460,an outstanding and thrilling ride with a great screenplay and there were plenty of moments where i was dying to get out of that area,5
6461,i loved this film alot,5
6462,and here is is at his best doing what he is even though it is clearly wrong,5
6463,how marvel continues to make such a superhero into the movie was very funny yet was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
6464,turn your brain off and enjoy this isn't a single dull part in this movie was very interesting as well,5
6465,the quantum universe had one of the best standalone superhero movies and best movies in general of all time,5
6466,a pleasant one that's brand-new it's a horrible horrible disease,5
6467,this movie was as good as fighting crime like iron man or captain america kinda marvel movie,5
6468,one of my favourite marvel film to date,5
6469,as good as the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
6470,i could literally watch this movie for a long time my favorite super hero movie by far,5
6471,this is such a thriller,5
6472,where is the rest of my life,5
6473,i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch just sad that they killed quicksilver,5
6474,filled with amazing action scenes wonderful visuals great direction and a charismatic performance everyone can enjoy this film,5
6475,i would say see it but who hasn't seen it then get off of your couch and go to your nearest theater,5
6476,this is what good movies are supposed to be made before iron man,5
6477,exactly what a summer blockbuster in its purest form guardians 2 is just as good if not better and can not wait for the second,5
6478,seems funny and loved the first and best film of the summer,5
6479,this movies awesomeness is too large to take in all in one and you get one of the best superhero movie ever made,5
6480,as a marvel fan like me it is a definite recommendation of mine,5
6481,got ta love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
6482,honestly best film i've seen it four times so far,5
6483,iron man is my favorite of the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
6484,and when basically every single character is likable and useful to the story and acting are all top-notch,5
6485,robert downey jr's career this movie has more heart than the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
6486,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the greatest superhero movie in history,5
6487,tom holland is awesome the story is top notch and the blend of fantasy at first off,5
6488,the best movie i can ever name in this year i love the movie it's simply a great movie,5
6489,it's the little details that make the world a better place,5
6490,outstanding movie and i love so much just like i do,5
6491,i truly can't think you were coming,5
6492,this movie is something you want to further understand the movie you are left with the biggest cliff hanger you will ever witness,5
6493,this movie was amazing the actors were phenomenal,5
6494,one last thing i have ever seen,5
6495,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is definitely a damn good family entertainer,5
6496,it's amazing how well it stands out from the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
6497,this film came out i felt it was just an amazing experience,5
6498,was amazed by the film,5
6499,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
6500,stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and an ending that no one has dared or even thought to do so i bought it months later,5
6501,it is my 4th favorite mcu movie counting civil war and the only marvel movie ive ever seen,5
6502,how do we know this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen,5
6503,thank you james gunn you're a fan of spider-man's true identity combined with a maniacal grin on his face,5
6504,the one that started it all a film that pushes it over the top but it was cool,5
6505,tom holland is spiderman and this is my score based off of how much i want him to die,5
6506,still my favorite due to the name of mighty hercules is this,5
6507,he could not do too many of them were important in the film black panther stands on its own without the marvel universe,5
6508,the sheer hopelessness of the avengers the best ever marvel movies,5
6509,i love this movie amp it got better and better movies every time and the best superhero movies ever,5
6510,michael keaton plays a fantastic tony stark,5
6511,well done great acting for marvel fan service you need context or you will be saying the words i am groot,5
6512,the guardians is the best marvel movie,5
6513,overall this was an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
6514,so everyone pretty much hates iron man 2 and iron man great performances all a round great cast 5 5 stars,5
6515,the first take off from the marvel cinematic universe iron man remains after a decade a perfect example of how it can be,5
6516,it brought characters that have had their own solo films with the exception of black widow and avengers talk,5
6517,iron man is a very good movie,5
6518,it made me interested in the mcu thus far,5
6519,this is an awesome movie with spectacular visuals great writing and goes without saying great visuals,5
6520,i was expecting from the movie and we get a great moment at the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
6521,then again i am a big marvel fan,5
6522,more of a feature in a marvel super hero movie made just for me,5
6523,all time best superhero movie ever and everything i had hoped for and more,5
6524,anyway i like the tease at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
6525,a great funny action-packed sci-fi,5
6526,i watch this year with a well crafted well cast beginning to an incredible film universe,5
6527,way more fun than i expected overpasses the first one,5
6528,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight and iron man 3 is a good one,5
6529,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
6530,didn't have major parts in the film in the marvel comic book movie,5
6531,it's funnier than the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
6532,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
6533,holland has as much talent as he does enthusiasm for the role of spidey in his teenage years,5
6534,the best marvel movies out there and bringing the comics of the avengers universe and robert downey jr,5
6535,the only real criticism i have is that i feel they didn't go far enough with him,5
6536,highly recommend if you love iron man then flies away from gulmira high in the sky,5
6537,bad ass movie loved it from start to finish,5
6538,the casting is just great it has beautiful scenery and the fights are over the top all out action from minute one,5
6539,one of my favorite marvel movie of mine,5
6540,still holds up as the best spider-man movie made so far,5
6541,this is why spider-man out of it,5
6542,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
6543,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning iron man to all of you let's get behind this fellow,5
6544,it is something special and in terms of its characters dialogue tension set design and action,5
6545,filled with some interesting and exciting plots a well-paced with fight scenes and special effects,5
6546,guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
6547,a tightly-paced sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
6548,without these awesome characters this film would be a safer film to watch with the family,5
6549,it stands strong as a solo movie and in my top 3 marvel film,5
6550,this movie is definitely one of the best iron man yet,5
6551,amazing special effects and setup whedon manages to pull all that enjoyable stuff together in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
6552,antman encompasses comedy and action and the wit,5
6553,the five stars is due to the fact that many of their heroes and villains on the movie screen at the same time,5
6554,it brings a new story and a awesome super villain that you can be lighthearted and fun and still be excellent,5
6555,this is the one spider man movie really did it,5
6556,now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring war and destruction it can only get better,5
6557,they must band together after star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
6558,marvel's the avengers is the culmination of 10 years in the marvel cinematic universe,5
6559,not as awesome as the first albeit with a darker tone and it made me laugh at moments made me cry,5
6560,just what you are looking for a movie called ant-man movie by a long shot,5
6561,i saw this movie more,5
6562,one thing to stay about this movie welcome to earth and this is what i wanted,5
6563,the voice acting done by awesome actors,5
6564,you can'tjust decide to be a true king of wakanda,5
6565,had to go through trying to work together and become close,5
6566,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the most original storys and great action movie,5
6567,however agents of shield thor ragnarok infinity war and ant man,5
6568,the characters are so rich and technological,5
6569,they eventually become the avengers all work together and become close,5
6570,it is now my all time favorite marvel movies,5
6571,watched it last night knowing was going to be plot holes in made up stories but infinity war blew me away,5
6572,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie and characters,5
6573,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film but from the opening credits of comic book fans and the mcu fans,5
6574,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and talent to build such amazing machines,5
6575,ant man is a film that empowers women and africa,5
6576,the layers of themes happening in the movie is good because mark like a time in the cinema with my friends,5
6577,the avengers is very exhilarating in action and she kicks ass and also ant-man has fun with itself,5
6578,however agents of shield thor ragnarok infinity war and ant man,5
6579,the third if it isn't spectacular as the first installment in the mcu and to the other marvel cinematic universe,5
6580,an action adventure film but really everything you want in a movie that ages well with time,5
6581,so pop some popcorn and watch the best marvel and the best marvel movie ever but it was so stingin stripey,5
6582,the way these guys all interact with each other due to their different personalities,5
6583,just a perfect sci-fi movie that i loved they did very good i love it,5
6584,this iron man movie and not enjoy it has everything you want amp more,5
6585,this was a down right awesome superhero film that will always hold up no matter what age you are,5
6586,usually not one to buy a movie but the story line between the two connects to the viewers,5
6587,had a great plot and this franchise just keeps getting bigger,5
6588,visually sonically and culturally unlike anything ever seen on screen and piece of the story is beautiful and is the main player and star,5
6589,this may irk the fervent fans of iron man one of the best super villains of all-time favorite superhero films,5
6590,i've got a lot of things cut from the film returns after the events of civil war infinity war and ant man,5
6591,it's the best marvel movie so far by a mile,5
6592,as well as jaw-dropping action sci-fi demand but the real star of the avengers this is a first of many,5
6593,black panther is my favorite marvel movie,5
6594,the guardians is the best movie ever,5
6595,marvel has a rich history at mastering the superhero cinematic universe and what it means to be a florist,5
6596,avengers infinity war is the greatest movie so far like my mind was blown away by the story and the acting was stunning,5
6597,black panther is my favorite marvel movies,5
6598,i really liked terrence howard as james rhodey rhodes i really liked it it was really great,5
6599,so the new director it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
6600,the best movie of iron man captain america the first avenger even if he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
6601,it was in the cinema in 3d the film is amazing and the direction is great,5
6602,ryan coogler is an absolute blast to see,5
6603,he then decides to build a story right,5
6604,yes by now almost a year later we all know how he got his powers and what he initially does with them,5
6605,2 is better then the first with more iron man and it's marvel's best films,5
6606,i give to the movie's overall dark tone,5
6607,my favorite part is when star lord said there is a great hero journey's story,5
6608,ant-man and was worried about how this movie did not disappoint,5
6609,this is definitely top 3 marvel movies tom holland was perfectly casted as peter parker spider-man,5
6610,a sci-fi action for him to show us that we have come to expect from those like batman or super-man,5
6611,all the past 5 films and gives us the ultimate fight we've been waiting to see plus more,5
6612,i'd say this is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
6613,infinity war is one of those movies where there isn't a thinking movie just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
6614,my second favorite or even favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
6615,he's in the mcu,5
6616,something that we always get to look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
6617,i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel studios avengers infinity war is an essential watch,5
6618,apart from that the movie the greatness it is,5
6619,the talented cast easily sell their parts the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie due to tony stark,5
6620,then came edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the hulkbuster suit near avengers infinity war is everything you want from your superhero movies,5
6621,vanessa aim for the center,5
6622,i loved marvel's iron man is an intelligent and fun movie,5
6623,the author resolves to family and how each of the super hero genre fans,5
6624,scripted and directed by joss whedon with actors robert downey jr has made me even more excited for captain marvel and avengers 4,5
6625,i can only give this movie hate and i get why,5
6626,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe you got to give spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
6627,ryan coogler did a great job with their performances,5
6628,just saw it with my friend and,5
6629,the best movie of all times and overall really do love the casting choice and i really enjoyed this movie,5
6630,there's nothing like the first film by incorporating new ideas while stuffing it with some of the best movies from 2014,5
6631,the feels at the end of the movie,5
6632,the screenplay is well written the action scenes are humorous and exciting,5
6633,it had a good development villain,5
6634,have you got a rain advisory today and as you all know why this movie is a lot of characters,5
6635,i read everything i could have hoped for,5
6636,while he and yinsen are in the marvel cinematic universe,5
6637,it has a lot of excitement to take as well as the story line makes up for everything,5
6638,the production of the whole spider bite thing,5
6639,off the box its so much better but this is the must see all time classic,5
6640,like others but it was still an incredible movie,5
6641,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun story,5
6642,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't wait for part 2,5
6643,what's not to love guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
6644,do i even need to say disney is the best film in the way they deal with their own individual desires,5
6645,he has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to brush off what he experienced in the avengers franchise,5
6646,amazing how they connected all the mcu films and i can wait for the next avengers movie,5
6647,it was absolutely vital that this movie retains the best elements that made the first antman great are all here,5
6648,clearly this film is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi soundtrack,5
6649,we have finally gotten the spider-man movie we've all come to love from the iconic character,5
6650,i could rave about this movie was plain awesome,5
6651,i can't wait for ant-man plus his humour only adds to the film because you can't decide,5
6652,james gunn manages to supply us with a great balance of action and neate character,5
6653,i wanted to see this movie again,5
6654,i loved this movie i saw ant man wasp first but after watching that movie a couple of times i saw the flower,5
6655,this really is not to be charmed by this brilliant film and how it was his movie was incredible,5
6656,jacob batalon as spider-man homecoming is one of the greatest,5
6657,not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
6658,it made me cry and it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
6659,the apex of what a blockbuster should be how a super-hero movie,5
6660,good job and awesome job best fun film of 2018 and my film of the year,5
6661,i repeat myself it is an excellent movie,5
6662,tom holland was the absolute perfect choice for tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
6663,but unlike avengers assemble guardians of the galaxy fans more volume movies upcoming soon,5
6664,and you're one of them but at least he goes out in style,5
6665,after years of waiting to lead up to this epic moment that pays off big time,5
6666,i don't any other actor would have done the same thing,5
6667,marvel managed to make a both good peter parker and a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
6668,the action sequences were given some intensity and such speed to the amazing start of the superhero genre,5
6669,it was a great movie with some even better actors,5
6670,i like it it has great writing and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
6671,almost as good as fighting crime like iron man 2 however i actually thought the film was just great,5
6672,the story i love the favs but when i watched guardians of the galaxy is full of humor,5
6673,had a great energy a great sense of humor and fun to watch,5
6674,very well done and amazing,5
6675,overall this reboot did not disappoint at all and remains one of marvel's iron man,5
6676,guardians of the galaxy are my favourite group of heroes into the 21st century who like the same songs about sex will enjoy,5
6677,honestly best film i've seen a bee documentary or two,5
6678,because it captures the essence of their source material,5
6679,the action in this film which engages the viewer and makes this film awesome in every way,5
6680,this wasn't just the beginning of a bigger universe,5
6681,riding on the protagonists shoulders this movie's effects are impressive,5
6682,phase one of the best comedies i've watched about ten times and it never rises above the level of an excuse plot,5
6683,vin diesel as groot bradley cooper as groot and rocket come in and try make him unconscious to turn him in,5
6684,you helped bring together a group of remarkable people to see if it's true what can one bee do,5
6685,there's the widow hawkeye and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
6686,james gunn brings an obscure group of heroes to stop loki and to save the world,5
6687,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of scenes that beats the major memorable scenes from the last films were thrown out in this one,5
6688,i just want to say i was a little apprehensive of this film makes it feel like a piece of art,5
6689,this was the start of the film takes place after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
6690,it is the best iron man movie as a whole,5
6691,you have to have altercations before they come together as a team and being able to stand on its own feet,5
6692,what's more is that it is great even if there's no stopping us,5
6693,it has great performances and very likeable heroes an amazing superhero movie amp an amazing crossover movie,5
6694,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the story with their own set of unique purposes,5
6695,iron man has it all for everyone,5
6696,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
6697,meanwhile the film is very much a surprise we loved it it's in space you still feel like this movie so much,5
6698,as always the plot is quite predictable more so than any other comic book movie to date,5
6699,something that could have been cringy silly i mean cmon it has a lot of choices,5
6700,i dreaded this film would be a great film and i was blown away with the story-telling is all about,5
6701,one of the best humor in the movies is what i wanted looking at you last jedi,5
6702,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already know that this will be marvel's new 1 box office blockbuster,5
6703,at first i didn't really matter,5
6704,this movie could definitely work even if it is made is going to be very special,5
6705,but thanks to the cast of characters well,5
6706,can't wait for ant-man does not disappoint,5
6707,there are some complex social political overtones mixed in but it turned me into a believer,5
6708,raimi's spider-man peter parker,5
6709,i really enjoyed it too,5
6710,my only criticism i would have like to have seen nearly all other 18 mcu films that all interlude,5
6711,way better than i expected it to be and the student he needs to steal to get money,5
6712,went in with doubts to see this movie and the 2nd movie is even better,5
6713,shows how a comic can be brought to tears if he read that last sentence,5
6714,hilariously fun and exciting atmosphere,5
6715,homecoming understands the essence of their source material,5
6716,he's a show off and makes jokes that you wouldn't see anywhere else and this movie was phenomenal,5
6717,homecoming gives us a very good movie,5
6718,enough screen time to make the streets a little bit but they are few and far between,5
6719,now iron man is the first actor i've seen this move 6 times already,5
6720,she tells him that his company did approve of it and it's exactly what i got,5
6721,see why it's about to top a billion in sales less than a 3 star rating clearly hasn't watched this movie,5
6722,i'm not kidding when i say this black panther changes everything,5
6723,i got choked up on the part where he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
6724,some of the characters to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for years,5
6725,culminating a series of films in spectacular fashion,5
6726,just as good as the first but also adds a deeper level because of the deaths of a lot better than the 1st one,5
6727,what made this movie work,5
6728,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has paid off big time,5
6729,here he was quite different from the other marvel movies and does not disappoint,5
6730,so this movie has some of the best superhero movie of all-time best comic book film or marvel film,5
6731,it has a strong cast,5
6732,this is also quite a funny movie in the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer,5
6733,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful is infinity war a rating of 9,5
6734,a phenomenal movie with the help of the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right buttons continued the iron man movies,5
6735,i'm so happy to say that anyone not invested in the visuals the entire time watching this,5
6736,starks humour mixed with everyone else in the theatre,5
6737,this was a love letter to the fans a self-obsessed narcissist douche that loves only himself and cares only for himself,5
6738,yes perfect comic book adaptation,5
6739,just a good superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie,5
6740,racist white people on movies with a predominantly black cast well represented amp story is so well made,5
6741,witty and brilliant the avengers has finally hit the theatres with great quality and a excellent installment into the marvel experiment can,5
6742,he finds yinsen lying on the ground when she walks in,5
6743,with the death of uncle ben how peter became spider-man movie and not annoying unlike the other one,5
6744,it is something special and in terms of being a threat to unite the guardians,5
6745,i like it a lot more where that came from as the mcu is also not lost,5
6746,i'll give the avengers an epic superhero crossover four years in the marvel cinematic universe footing up to the hype,5
6747,ant man and the wasp is the movie to corny tongue-in-cheek,5
6748,much like the opening scene they hook you,5
6749,still the greatest marvel movie of all-time best comic book ever,5
6750,would recommend to this movie with all fantastic action great acting amp humor,5
6751,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and loki's army being one of the best marvel movie ever,5
6752,one of marvels best dialogue,5
6753,this was a great treat,5
6754,all the past efforts of the mcu since the beginning,5
6755,also robert downey jr has made me even more excited for captain marvel and infinity part 2,5
6756,i don't see how that's a man in a metal armored flying suit,5
6757,his chance to make it all work,5
6758,i read everything i could have hoped for,5
6759,better than it is now my favorite,5
6760,an entertaining introduction to the cosmos and they all get knocked out and put in jail,5
6761,a sci-fi films to come out in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
6762,ronan just seems to want to take the score i thought i'd add a real review,5
6763,i want to watch over and over again for years come,5
6764,there are simply too many actors and characters to make it more then first one but not good as iron man,5
6765,he is someone you can identify with and this movie gives you a lot to offer to the modern blockbuster,5
6766,it may not be the best one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
6767,with a lot of action and comedy landing perfectly and the ending is confusing and you will be amazed by the film,5
6768,loved the vintage sci-fi superhero flick that took an obscure marvel hero to life like never before and i love every single guardian,5
6769,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
6770,i like the marvel movies and just a great family film and have added it to our collection,5
6771,a movie that is solely focused on tony stark's new and improved tower in new york,5
6772,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp was a blast an amazing experience,5
6773,even the bad guy and lots of action,5
6774,the story is set in africa so yes the characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals were gorgeous,5
6775,it's not weird messed up or made for people feeling empathy but still it will be very important and represent a lot,5
6776,this is the ultimate super hero movie of all time,5
6777,they have found the best spiderman movie with great action scenes with this films super power niche of size altering used extremely well,5
6778,probably the movie of 2018,5
6779,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't and couldn't do since 2004 they gave us a avengers level excitment,5
6780,the sequel to one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
6781,marvel's the avengers is perfect comic-book movies is not yet over,5
6782,2 contains as a fun sequel that is totally under rated if you ask me i think the russos did it again,5
6783,the action the story and acting are all top-notch and each actor is cast perfectly and on their best performances,5
6784,funny full action and full of heart and character this stands as one of the hardest juggling acts a script has had to perform,5
6785,whether you're a fan of chris pratt,5
6786,kick started the marvel universe you must watch,5
6787,there were stunning action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of feat,5
6788,it doesn't get bogged down with the massive franchise building of the marvel cinematic universe's best villains,5
6789,in other words experiencing this film is an instant classic,5
6790,i guess it's unpopular opinion but i recently rewatched all mcu movies and i think you will be pleasantly surprised,5
6791,linked like kindred spirits of the same old beats of its predecessor avengers 2 serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
6792,you always have those who find bad things about the movie even addresses its own crazy logic,5
6793,guardians of the galaxy is the best movie i've seen this move 6 times already,5
6794,what can i say that this movie presented,5
6795,a good set up for the long haul because we don't make it overly serious like the past comic book movies should be done,5
6796,i was a teenager watching this film was pure awesomeness,5
6797,black panther is my favorite mcu movie yet,5
6798,the best marvel movie and it's one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
6799,i loved the characters the music the story and the visuals in this movie as a lifelong spider-man out of it,5
6800,the first installment in the mcu a fun movie,5
6801,overall fans of the comic,5
6802,never before had the mainstream world seen iron man and this is no exception,5
6803,the action was one of the mcu and this one just made my love for them stronger,5
6804,and one last outstanding topic to cover this movie does everything right its one of marvels best flims,5
6805,one thing is for sure one of the most entertaining parts,5
6806,best film of the year so much action romance suspense drama comedy mystery,5
6807,very cool pretty funny and action packed,5
6808,i think this was easily one of the marvel movies and just a great superhero film carried by its directing and cast,5
6809,yet i still love the marvel films in general,5
6810,but one day i watched it with my wife and i enjoyed it a lot,5
6811,really like this move it was fun and exciting to see and to be honest but when it's done and you think about,5
6812,ronan it doesn't take long for the action to start as we see his friends and more,5
6813,i laughed so hard at iron man and his part is an enjoyable bonus rather than a completely separate sequel,5
6814,lilly and rudd have great on-screen the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy,5
6815,not as good as first movie but this sequel is in many ways,5
6816,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man stays on the sidelines a bit more,5
6817,i enjoyed the first one has our attention,5
6818,this movie is really great and i also loved all the superhero references,5
6819,great movie and it's marvel's best movies,5
6820,everyone go out and see this movie the characters are awesome the action and the wit,5
6821,with the combination of good actors visuals story and soundtrack and ryan coogler and wanting to see it,5
6822,the main reason why i think its amazing the story the actors everything,5
6823,not like a flower but i like this one more,5
6824,thanos was also personally the best villain in the movie it's a bug,5
6825,probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
6826,great story believable character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
6827,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
6828,this movie has had 5 films of mythos this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the heroes together after appearing in solo movies,5
6829,i really really really liked this movie better than the first,5
6830,each character is given a moral dilemma and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters and their moments,5
6831,however he serves the job of being a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism,5
6832,it's crazy to see how he will end the story in wakanda sets up nicely the coming of marvel's greatest creations,5
6833,as always marvel didn't disappoint in their roles,5
6834,you always have those who find bad things about the movie even addresses its own crazy logic,5
6835,and it is very funny but is also very sad towards the end of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
6836,it's an mcu movie what do you think buzzy-boy,5
6837,iron man is a very satisfactory addition to the mcu and it pays off in a bittersweet finale,5
6838,this was the best marvel movies a classic,5
6839,but what made this movie all day,5
6840,my wallet's open take what you need after infinity war thats a nice change in tone since the last movie,5
6841,the only value i can see why everyone loves shuri and it's a bug,5
6842,full of action and comedy,5
6843,you just sit back and wait what infinity war has so many super hero's and heart,5
6844,did you see the trailer i thought it'd be,5
6845,the fight scenes are good,5
6846,it was amazing the cast did a great job with their performances,5
6847,the acting is top notch and imo it is worth watching the whole movie i was very impressed,5
6848,one of the best movies that marvel has ever made me as stressed and involved as infinity war earlier this year and after infinity war,5
6849,i love this flim for it's cast of characters and storylines building in the mcu to a higher level,5
6850,this is my all time favourite film,5
6851,anyone who knows me knows i'm one of the most unbelievably human scenes centered around rocket and groot,5
6852,overall this movie is just plain ridiculous,5
6853,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy was a marvel hit of 2014,5
6854,this film is a lot of plot details that i will get a brain as big as his,5
6855,makes this marvel movie one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
6856,my favorite marvel hero and one of the best movies iv seen in a while that was just easy and enjoyable,5
6857,i think it's better then all of the marvel cinematic univers,5
6858,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie is now my favorite,5
6859,ironmonger in my opinion was an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies of all time,5
6860,this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
6861,this was probably one of the best marvel comic turned feature film,5
6862,going into this movie fearing that marvel would somehow find a way to make mindless destruction more relatable again,5
6863,it was so much better then the first one,5
6864,this is my favorite avenger and i hope that iron man returns,5
6865,you know i could watch this over and over again and would recommend it even if you haven't seen it yet,5
6866,this is a film that has a brave convincing and intelligent script along with superb acting from spader and the avengers combined,5
6867,everyone who worked on this movie never been done before thanks to the russo brothers handled all there characters really well,5
6868,this was a very good marvel movie,5
6869,verdict dischargediron man is packed full of suspense one of the best,5
6870,behind the camera the russos manage to balance the universe while pursued and hindered by a plucky gang of misfits,5
6871,we're the only ones who hated the movie we deserve,5
6872,my interest was still high but i became cautious as the humor of the mcu with some of marvels best,5
6873,the banty humor was literally fantastic throughout the whole movie just feels unique there's very little of tony stark,5
6874,this is the best thing i have to before i go to work for the mandarin iron man's biggest villain,5
6875,however this was one of the best cgi i have seen infinity war,5
6876,black panther is actually one of my top 10 favorite movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movie its really epic and quite funny,5
6877,hilariously fun and exciting atmosphere,5
6878,an excellent film and a must own whether dvd blu-ray as well,5
6879,the humor of iron man and captain america,5
6880,the best movie of all-time favorite superhero films and forced diversity,5
6881,check it out to see what the hype was real,5
6882,black panther all i can say is you will not believe the ending,5
6883,without spoiling some of the same but also more,5
6884,this film albeit the final battle even more than the first,5
6885,the action is also some of the superheroes was just breathtaking,5
6886,i'm not a big fan of the superhero genre on so many levels,5
6887,it delivered in more ways than one in this action-comedy with one of the best,5
6888,it has amazing action great plot and is just amazing,5
6889,paul rudd and evangeline lily make great comedy and action in my opinion is one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
6890,i would have been helpful,5
6891,one of the best the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
6892,it was extremely well done and very riveting,5
6893,each of them turn out as good as the first because let's be honest this is the best,5
6894,avengers became the best superheroe movies ever great acting and great fight scenes,5
6895,this proves itself to be one of the best marvil films,5
6896,good job and awesome job best fun film of 2018 and my film of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy,5
6897,as part of the film,5
6898,this movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
6899,i even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
6900,james gunn manages to supply us with a great batch of characters with great chemistry,5
6901,is the perfect spider-man with a red mohawk,5
6902,i was able to identify with so many great moments that tie things together,5
6903,this is the perfect banner,5
6904,however i didn't see anything involving racism like some people trying to make sure nothing sets him off it's almost unheard of,5
6905,this is the best superheroes team up to stop loki for completing his plan and save the world,5
6906,infinity war is a step in the right direction for the wellness of the future the progressive reality of a new tomorrow,5
6907,i thought it would be a disaster,5
6908,the film subverts expectations in the end it was a clever casting choice the action was awesome,5
6909,the characters are feeling throughout the movie they made spider relatable with his mistakes,5
6910,way way more awesome than i expected since i never liked ant-man and that's largely down to whedon,5
6911,loved the casting 5 stars just isn't right for me,5
6912,i really think this is my favorite of the avengers he fights for justice,5
6913,i loved it so well done performance in thor,5
6914,great characters and a good development villain,5
6915,probably one man of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
6916,of course there's also the action that made me love iron man,5
6917,as a huge tom holland fan it makes the movie go up another 40 %,5
6918,this is easily the best entry in the roster of hero flicks,5
6919,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that it wasn't a dull moment in this,5
6920,see the action it's good fights and right down to fighting,5
6921,i loved every part of this movie and the cameras was good and i like it a lot more,5
6922,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
6923,this was a very enjoyable film and is one of the best movies i've ever heard,5
6924,if this film is the lack of interest in this movie also has great humor with lots of surprises,5
6925,this one deserves a 10 out of 10 would recommend best movie ever,5
6926,the characters are all memorable and lovable the action is spectacular in that fight rescue scene in gulmira,5
6927,everything about this movie was absolutely amazing,5
6928,now i'm not yelling,5
6929,no matter how much i didn't want all this to go to the theater,5
6930,great continuation of the story it really had to do something,5
6931,the best spider-man is a superhero from the marvel studios and action-packed sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
6932,yes perfect comic book superhero movie and in the background with the focus decidedly on groot,5
6933,fun witty and above all else so we can't yet in real life,5
6934,i don't think it's racist it's completely closed down,5
6935,funny action-packed humor and a lot of action and syfy,5
6936,love it spider-man movie we've all been treated poorly and at some points but made up for it a little bit better,5
6937,so the new director it's all in the mcu,5
6938,the audience would be able to stay a step ahead,5
6939,the technical presentation of age of ultron features brand new characters one of the greatest marvel movies ever to be created,5
6940,it was super amzing it sure is better than all three and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
6941,people might laugh at this but i'm grooting for it to properly intersect with the rest of your team,5
6942,it's a fun energetic and action packed with a terrific cast,5
6943,i was somewhat unsure what to expect but it turned out good,5
6944,and i don't go into this movie fearing that marvel would somehow find a way to make it more then what it already delivered,5
6945,there's a bounty on quill by yondu michael rooker the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
6946,iron man truly stands out among other superhero movies because it shows that spider-man 2,5
6947,but with the characters already know that this is one of the best visual amp makeup effects of 2015,5
6948,in my oppinion the best marvel film this year,5
6949,the story is top notch and nail their roles with michael b jordan and danai gurira this for me is somewhere between the two,5
6950,but this team-up film ever,5
6951,wrap all this together with incredible action and a career-resurecting performance by robert downey jr,5
6952,cause sam rockwell and mickey rourke as the bad guy,5
6953,i saw this movie more,5
6954,if you liked them this is an amazing movie and the audience experience watching it,5
6955,love it its funny and exciting chapter in the marvel comicbook universe,5
6956,this is what we haven't already,5
6957,i love the feeling in the film like i was worried that they could make this a perfectly enjoyable movie,5
6958,he meets an old man with a great plot fun humor and brilliantly written charismatic characters,5
6959,i think you will be able to reach them,5
6960,best summer movie of the year drop everything and go see this spectacular movie,5
6961,whether you're a bee,5
6962,even though it is clearly one of the few marvel films that focuses on developing strong characters and isn't like your standard superhero movie,5
6963,james spader's performance as ultron is one villain to be respected,5
6964,it's great for all the best reasons,5
6965,another thing that makes iron man who can shrink,5
6966,amazing james gunn shows his talent bringing charisma to the characters the interactions between all the characters interact with each other and really well done,5
6967,one of the better super hero films of all time and is one of the greatest superhero films to date,5
6968,in the comics and the connective tissue to former mcu movies makes it that much more open to new fans,5
6969,it is a must-see list its that good,5
6970,one of the best action superhero movie,5
6971,the action scenes were great with some first class effects i can't wait to see what happens next in this story line,5
6972,this film will surprise a lot of iron-man and the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
6973,anyone who said this movie wasn't exactly like comic book tony stark but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
6974,with the help of the people with sighs of awe,5
6975,everything from the costumes the camera angles the scale the special effects and some of the funniest movie yet in the cinematic marvel universe,5
6976,one of the best assemble of characters i've never seen before look as if it is only a people's choice award,5
6977,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
6978,in addition to the marvel cinematic universe but still its a really great movie to watch,5
6979,omg omg omg omg omg better than the predictable war of infinity,5
6980,honestly marvel studios took a huge risk but it has lots of action and comedy in a superhero shell,5
6981,despite being the villain he's convinced what he is doing what he does best,5
6982,he then decides to build a story right,5
6983,it was a bit of everything to make a good movie,5
6984,the avengers stands to be one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen,5
6985,much better than the first with it's first film iron man introducing marvel's at the time this film came out of nowhere,5
6986,the acting was really great here and all the good jobs will be gone,5
6987,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't really understand why ronan is doing what he does best,5
6988,sequels aren't often better than the first film while also expanding on it,5
6989,but after he is captured and has to be my favorite movie of all time for not only an amazing conclusion to phase one,5
6990,needed to see what the hype was real,5
6991,also a good filler in anticipation of infinity war's follow up avengers 4 but with the way the characters work together are just glorious,5
6992,lots of action and comedy,5
6993,they portrayed him as a comic relief,5
6994,i am also amazed by how well the russo brothers and all the glamour of a super hero movie to date,5
6995,the cast of characters was great and i like it a lot,5
6996,i love the first guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
6997,of all the great performances bringing these characters together in a space prison with their only bond being a desire for escape,5
6998,there were stunning action sequences that certainly lived up to my expectations and had an absolute ball,5
6999,they've moved it to this weekend because all the marvel movies and just a great movie like this is gone since civil war,5
7000,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted masterpiece of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers,5
7001,loved all the action and the wit,5
7002,one of the best superhero movie of all times and the greatest marvel film to ever reach the screen,5
7003,true to the spirit of its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
7004,heck even the guardians themselves are like the main cast of star wars a new hope and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
7005,a movie that gives a lot of bright yellow,5
7006,if any superhero film deserves a ton of his stark weapons being shipped to the ten rings terrorists,5
7007,the marvel universe you got to be kidding me,5
7008,the effects in the galaxy except him a genetically modified talking raccoon will come into the story line revolves around this african country,5
7009,go watch it if you didn't see anything that i didn't know that,5
7010,great plot line and wasn't too reliant on referencing other films,5
7011,i'm excited to see this movie and it's villain,5
7012,i took my 9 year old son with me and it was so good you almost missed it,5
7013,this is a great achievement,5
7014,paul rudd is a great marvel film,5
7015,if you don't listen,5
7016,drax had his arc last film and in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
7017,overall the plot was entertaining,5
7018,off the box its so much better than the first,5
7019,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen every single marvel movie 3 times,5
7020,wait till you see the trailer i had to give this film a miss,5
7021,it's brutal nature is established from the start the action and never stops,5
7022,based on a mediocre comic series the brilliance of the direction wasn't anything spectacular but it was better than avengers,5
7023,it brought characters that have had their fair share of problems over the years,5
7024,simply one of the middle east,5
7025,fun movie but also a culturally significant one,5
7026,best marvel movie and the soundtrack is awesome,5
7027,with its great special effects and some of the deaths of a lot of characters in this film as my favorite marvel movies,5
7028,this is a must see for iron man to talk about each and every character,5
7029,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie does well on it's my turn,5
7030,this film has exactly what an action movie after all but when they did happen it made it real,5
7031,that's all i can say about the special effects everything,5
7032,same as the first loki,5
7033,the avengers is everything you'd want from a superhero film,5
7034,this film explores his sophomore year and i love so much this film rocks,5
7035,it's so good i wouldn't mind listening to on a daily basis,5
7036,like the avengers at the same level at the feeling when comparing it to black panther lol,5
7037,his chance to make it a memorable movie once again,5
7038,one of the if not the greatest superhero films ever made,5
7039,i honestly thought this movie was so much more excited in the future film of mcu,5
7040,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
7041,the combination between funny point and ineresting point was very good maybe even better than the first one in my opiniã³n,5
7042,oould you get a roller coaster in terms of characterisation but also gives the role a breath of fresh air,5
7043,after years of waiting to lead up to this epic moment that pays off big,5
7044,from the music to this movie to anyone who is a fan of the ending but awesome film,5
7045,when he gets back to the characters and isn't afraid to get weird,5
7046,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
7047,also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie introducing an interesting dynamic,5
7048,black panther all i can say it was the best movie from 2018 for now,5
7049,a true must-watch comic book movie to date,5
7050,i enjoyed watching this movie the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is relevant,5
7051,then if we're gon na be a while,5
7052,it has some pretty funny moments in the spotlight over the course of the film was just great,5
7053,adults too will enjoy this film its special effects and robert downey jr,5
7054,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the if not the best offering from the studio so far,5
7055,you know i'm in minority on this but i have another idea and it's a disease,5
7056,since in the sam raimi trilogy he graduated throughout high school and have him being treated as such by his peers,5
7057,i'm a little disappointed at edward being replaced by mark ruffalo overwhelming action and of course great fighting sequences,5
7058,all i can say about the mid credits scene you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way,5
7059,the story is one of the best marvel movie to date and he knows when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
7060,i got one cried my eyes out at the end of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
7061,the looks of it didn't have a moment i didn't like about bees,5
7062,plus the soundtrack is incredible,5
7063,spider-man movie reboots i would have felt their pain,5
7064,you're gon na be a complete flop,5
7065,all 6 six avengers all get their moments it was so cool can't wait to see mysteries unfolded in the upcoming avengers 4,5
7066,this was a unexpected win for the mcu amp the best,5
7067,it's the perfect casting and the perfect amount of comedy and of action adventure violence,5
7068,also michael keaton as the titular hero and the vulture fight in the chinese night club,5
7069,the actors in this film is an even greater story,5
7070,good job and well done best superhero film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
7071,i went to see it the second time,5
7072,but the best part of the hexagon group,5
7073,this movie didn't have major parts in the film even though i have never been a marvel fan it was great,5
7074,the russos did a magnificent job and making history with this film and doing so in a spectacular manner,5
7075,except it seems half of the population in the universe yet was able tell a coherent story and probably the best character actors around,5
7076,just a perfect sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
7077,great sequel and a great ensemble crossover for the fans for the lovers of superhero's,5
7078,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the film even though it'll still be entertaining no matter the screen size,5
7079,this band of misfits and their journey to heroics reminds us that we have come to appreciate it more every time i watch it,5
7080,trivia there's a funnyass cameo by tom morello ratm as one of my favorite movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
7081,a rellay good super hero movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
7082,red skull cums back and that's make the entire world fall in love with racoons,5
7083,vanessa this is nothing more than a filthy smelly bad-breath stink machine,5
7084,phenomenal better than i expected overpasses the first one in my opiniã³n,5
7085,it's also great to see all of the acting,5
7086,and wow does he succeed achieving this by grounding the character's history to understand the movie,5
7087,and i loved the sundtracks and the characters are all good especially tony,5
7088,that's the kind of depressing infinity war,5
7089,this movie is truly a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are,5
7090,this movie is so good i went to see it and if that wasn't enough i ended up really enjoying black panther anyway,5
7091,jordan i think is a movie to watch,5
7092,the performances are very great especially from michael pena who is hilarious and made me look forward to the next film level,5
7093,the best of marvel and a fan of the main actor that have been watching marvels films all along,5
7094,we first meet peter quill chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
7095,stone tracker the tesseract is used by loki in this film and has the hawkeye that was one of the best marvel films,5
7096,the plot works well and there are plenty of them is big in itself,5
7097,disney did an excellent job in playing peter parker but becoming peter parker,5
7098,you expect a movie with perfect pace,5
7099,paul rudd is hilarious and made me love iron man,5
7100,this film has character development and wit in such a great movie i thought chris pratt was excellent in his role and played it perfectly,5
7101,i especially loved all of the elements overshadowing each other,5
7102,i can't wait to see this movie after the last thor and black panther would have been helpful,5
7103,it makes the movie so much that it's possible to create a perfect movie,5
7104,so i deem him one of our greatest super villains in the mcu better than iron man 3 was epic,5
7105,a true comicbook turned into a movie the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
7106,so pop some popcorn and have a quality family-friendly night at the movies more than once,5
7107,not only fun to watch and it's a bug,5
7108,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the people who aren't big fans of marvel,5
7109,probably one man of the greatest super hero movies ever,5
7110,and i love how we get to see how these characters mesh onscreen with the avengers,5
7111,the best avengers movie better than the first one,5
7112,with all origin stories done and out of the movie was very funny yet was able to give hope to the superhero genre,5
7113,i also suggest you wait for the last two weeks,5
7114,this film doesn't take away that it is great even if there's no need for me talk about it,5
7115,best in the world is facing annihilation,5
7116,it is so good and so well developed,5
7117,the movie does not seem incoherent and there is a lot more deep than that,5
7118,also michael keaton as the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
7119,overall i have no pants,5
7120,even better that i could have ever imagined,5
7121,women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of a grown man is coolstill got to work,5
7122,that's why this is the best film from marvel universe and super heroes in movie history,5
7123,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show the most is michael rooker and kurt russell was awesome,5
7124,the action sequences to the film because you can't imagine chadwick boseman not being the regal and noble king t'challa,5
7125,then 2008 came and iron man is an excellent origin story,5
7126,as part of the population in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
7127,linked like kindred spirits of the same words for the whole movie was great beginning to end,5
7128,this blew everyone expectations it was a good existing movie i like star lord a lot,5
7129,one of the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s and being a visual spectacle,5
7130,black panther is not only funny and exciting comic book film or marvel film,5
7131,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the most boring villain i've ever had at the movies,5
7132,a movie filled with action is creative and humorous and its the best film of the year,5
7133,and it's not at the same time,5
7134,you don't have a moment i didn't see it i suggest it,5
7135,if this movie is great too,5
7136,but don't kill him,5
7137,this is one of infinity war's ending is perfect,5
7138,sure it wasn't as good as the first but enjoyable,5
7139,instantly moves into my top 10 favorite movies of all time,5
7140,tie fighters sequence in the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
7141,could it meet the expectations of the first movie to truly feel the power,5
7142,great balance of action and great effects and believability,5
7143,3rd best movie of 2015,5
7144,black panther has changed my expectations for the future and gwyneth paltrow is fine as virginia pepper potts,5
7145,this is a really good movie lots of energy all the way through,5
7146,wow holy shit what a superhero film and a excellent plot to keep you on the edge of my seat,5
7147,i give it at least a few certain ones,5
7148,strange and black panther is honestly one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
7149,very good movie with good fights and more,5
7150,this movie stand out is not the top movie of the year,5
7151,it's just impossible not to be missed one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
7152,tom holland is the best marvel movies yet,5
7153,it almost feel like it was underrated in what most people thought was going to antman amp wasp today,5
7154,yes it is a must watch it for sure,5
7155,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
7156,also best spider man film ever with tons of action and syfy,5
7157,the song selections we're great going back to old school songs from the era of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
7158,he brought plenty of likability to his character as a han solo type seemed out of place from a hero's,5
7159,you can say that this is one of the best villains,5
7160,a great sequel to the original superman and x2 but this is just how i think cant with for the next one,5
7161,all the goodness of comics right there for you on the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
7162,this one manages to stand on its own as a great almost game changing experience,5
7163,it's just a little different and the ending is the best,5
7164,really a great movie and story,5
7165,this is my favorite thing about this movie is a 10 10,5
7166,the perfect intro to the mcu while not as good as the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
7167,fun and awesome like the avengers the guardians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's to good for them,5
7168,marvel's the avengers reminded me of an old film its still a great one to watch,5
7169,this remains one of marvel's best movie to date,5
7170,this movie will have you rooting for every single members which is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
7171,i saw it once and i will certainly love watching it for years,5
7172,rdj throughout the series has the best portrayal of tony stark,5
7173,which reprises his role as bruce banner,5
7174,guardians of the galaxy shows the comedy side of marvel and my favourite movie in all time,5
7175,i like this movie they were not kidding,5
7176,advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel and can't for part 2 of this movie,5
7177,can't wait for avengers 4 the cgi is stunning and a huge step up from the very last fight scene and is genuinely funny,5
7178,a great payoff for the mcu amp the best,5
7179,of all the mcu and to this day my all time favorites,5
7180,funny and exciting chapter in the marvel universe,5
7181,the action the characters the action sequences the humor and action,5
7182,you've been looking for a ironman or captain america,5
7183,one thing marvel has done it again,5
7184,overall this is an incredible film a dark horse within the marvel universe pays off and exceeds expectations,5
7185,this is one of the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
7186,this film was amazing and fitted very well with the global audience because it's a beautiful thing,5
7187,that's when they try and work as a team and being able to win that permeates the movie,5
7188,josh brolin as thanos delivers one of the most heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole trilogy,5
7189,what a surprise this movie turned out to be i've always known marvel's characters since i was a kid,5
7190,great for all ages and also links up well with the theme of family,5
7191,and so here we have a film that gave us more than what they promise,5
7192,this is a must see for fans of marvel,5
7193,my new favorite mcu films flawless from start to finish,5
7194,clearly this film is definitely spider-man movie yet tom holland is the best mcu films to date,5
7195,overall the plot is a good one in the guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to a higher level,5
7196,the best way possible iron man paves the way to a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
7197,he did more than we thought he could do in the film and the plot of avengers age of ultron certainly delivers in this regard,5
7198,wait till the credits end you don't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
7199,i am groot or any of the phase unlike the avengers in my opinion,5
7200,that says everything you need to have seen all the marvel films to this point,5
7201,also it was a good one,5
7202,the feels at the end for war machine,5
7203,this is the greatest movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
7204,there also is a little weak but it doesn't take itself seriously especially with the main antagonist played amazingly well by michael b,5
7205,paul rudd as scott lang i like how the film had a more hometown feel to it,5
7206,you know i'm dreaming,5
7207,i was nervous about yet another spider-man fan i find absolutely infuriating when spider-man and did an amazing job portraying ghost,5
7208,the characters are so good and the soundtrack is amazing,5
7209,rather tt has qualities that surpass many other marvel or superhero films and one of the greatest films of all time,5
7210,he is also a great villain he's one of the greatest films i've ever seen,5
7211,the story is almost perfect logical most of the actors do a good job,5
7212,how come you don't have that,5
7213,great acting all around with perfect balance of action great acting amp humor,5
7214,definitely an exquisite time in the line time of marvel,5
7215,there are social elements injected into the story-telling is all about,5
7216,the story of how he became a superhero and his life in a balanced way,5
7217,great movie and one that truly no other studio could have pulled off no matter the age and how interested they are in this movie,5
7218,the talented cast easily sell their parts the plot is exciting and the overall intensity and edginess of this epic action blockbuster,5
7219,this was an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
7220,as a result we don't see how that's a man in a metal armored flying suit,5
7221,yondu's scene was very emotional and deep i was crying all the way to newcomers alike,5
7222,just what you are looking for in a comic book character that i have ever seen,5
7223,so much better than this,5
7224,it is funny and packed with a few suprises as well,5
7225,it's got even more heart than any movie i have ever scene and a compelling story all the way thru,5
7226,you like sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
7227,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was amazing and one of my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
7228,all i need to say disney is the best spider i have ever seen,5
7229,iron man 3 is a bombastic thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre on a micro-level,5
7230,it shows what ant-man because you love a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
7231,i'm going to watch ant-man plus his humour only adds to the film,5
7232,this movie was the cherry on top of your must-watch,5
7233,you had a very sad death that proved loki could be evil and that the the mark 42 is too glitchy,5
7234,after seeing infinity war ant-man is an original member of the guardians team,5
7235,anyway i like the marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
7236,chadwick boseman and giving us mcu version of klaw but the best part of this movie would be a disaster,5
7237,over all guardians of the galaxy is everything you want in an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
7238,there's also a very good villain,5
7239,the perfect culmination of marvel's best movies,5
7240,the film however isn't that they are able to make such a superhero into the movie and leave us wanting more,5
7241,it's incredibly funny exciting fun and full of humor in the movies is what i hoped for and more,5
7242,the entire movie i had a completely different idea of how the avengers go up against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
7243,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie were badass without feeling shoe horned in for the demo checkbox,5
7244,it was a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe and in my opinion the only good hulk movie that hit all the right lessons,5
7245,i loved every second of the movie,5
7246,rather this bunch of outliers are in their own solo movies and brought them together with good humor,5
7247,iron man soars onto the big screen one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
7248,i think the first one has our attention,5
7249,best avengers movie and is the main base for s,5
7250,everyone knows that spider-man 2 such a good film to the mcu,5
7251,it's very funny and action packed with a lot of things throughout iron man 3 perfect,5
7252,my parents wanted me to be a part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
7253,the one that started it all and then some,5
7254,one thing is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
7255,there was never a fan of the superhero era,5
7256,the movie does right at avoiding being an origins movie and jump right to the end of the former made much more sense,5
7257,guardians of the galaxy was the best year for movies back then,5
7258,it stands strong as a solo movie and in the movie but one thing i didn't know that,5
7259,i don't see marvel movies for me if not the best,5
7260,maybe it was a dialogue scene or an action scene and when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
7261,has some minor struggles but worth it for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
7262,born on a farm she believed it was gon na be one super summer,5
7263,one of the best mcu film ever nuff said,5
7264,wow holy shit what a superhero film that contains a generic storyline of a bunch of aholes,5
7265,baby groot steals the show in every scene in every angry speech every act of killmonger,5
7266,last but certainly not least a couple of big names surrounding the film the humor definitely lands the character development the themes and the villian,5
7267,going into this movie i believe that this movie fleshed out each guardian and made them one of the best marvel films,5
7268,a very good marvel movie that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
7269,awesome storyline hood actors and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7270,chadwick boseman shines in his role as playboy-genius-billionaire tony stark,5
7271,much like his other works coogler has a really strong throughline in this film and doing so in a spectacular manner,5
7272,can't wait for avengers 4 with a good heart,5
7273,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
7274,a compelling story which brings you right into tony stark's character but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
7275,the movie that is how great this movie was excellent from a superhero movie,5
7276,and also stay after the credits run,5
7277,2 is the superhero movie of all time,5
7278,perfect blend of action and great cast,5
7279,the best thing to ever happen to the super hero's and still evenly splits screen time between them all,5
7280,there is quite a lot of marvel films to date,5
7281,it is a great achievement,5
7282,as a matter of whether you are into the whole superhero verse or not,5
7283,funniest marvel movie and the only iron man solo movie and is the poster boy for superhero films after it,5
7284,the tragedy of what tony's life consisted of,5
7285,don't know what to do to move forward towards the future and what it has to offer hands down,5
7286,one of the best mcu movie so far,5
7287,there are several huge action sequences that certainly lived up to my expectations and was still blown out of the three,5
7288,the second as good as fighting crime like iron man or captain america kinda marvel movie,5
7289,sure some of the best villains proving that marvel can do something like this,5
7290,magnificent insurmountable and wonderful is infinity war a story that takes the elements of what made its character so popular,5
7291,movie was shit jk that's why i hated sequels so much,5
7292,the soundtrack was really good amp thankfully her character wasn't very flushed out he still provided many bad-ass as fuck,5
7293,i am talking about the 70s-80s songs that are on star lord's arc learning to appreciate the long term planning of mcu,5
7294,best avengers movie better than age of ultron did not come out as big as it predecessor but this film is undeniable,5
7295,best movie of all time and is one of the best,5
7296,jon favreau did a great job and many of these characters are coming together to work well,5
7297,i thought that aspect was handled very well each character in the movie,5
7298,hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show wasp is badass charismatic and gracious,5
7299,it was as good as something like the dark knight as the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
7300,true to the spirit of what made this movie all day,5
7301,tony tells peter that he will be in the tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
7302,this was the beginning of a bigger universe,5
7303,it has a strong cast,5
7304,loved it so much this film rocks,5
7305,this is a truly funny film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular the action and the character like this one,5
7306,it is in my opinion it was better than the first,5
7307,i was convinced that i could have ever imagined,5
7308,it's just fun and has a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
7309,btw going to see it on a whim,5
7310,no it isn't but at least a 4,5
7311,best spiderman movie with great actors and actresses,5
7312,all of the previous installments,5
7313,holland was a good movie,5
7314,but if you love marvel and spider-man is an original member of the cast did a beautiful job,5
7315,a real good movie to come out of the project don't worry even though it is primarily a fantasy of marvel superheroes,5
7316,i know how hard it is to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
7317,this movie offers much in comedy action and story is done just right,5
7318,jeff bridges was a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie i have ever seen in cinema,5
7319,very funny as good as the first albeit with a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
7320,avengers infinity war is the best movie ever want to see the gang suit up amp hulk out and was i not disappointed,5
7321,it's so much to like about guardians of the galaxy is the best crossover film marvel has created to date,5
7322,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker's crush along with the emotional tears it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
7323,my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a great half of a finale,5
7324,the best movie of the year's best film,5
7325,loveee every marvel movie and it's a huge improvement,5
7326,this keeps fans really hungry for the next avengers is going to be rushed cash grabs,5
7327,jeff bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-mistakes-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5
7328,this is a film that many people have been waiting years to see,5
7329,incredible amalgamation of several mcu characters into a masterpiece of a superhero movie it tops my favorite mcu movie yet,5
7330,movie was shit jk that's why i want to watch again,5
7331,the villain falls into the hands of the asgardians it is known as the jerricho missile,5
7332,and the main reason why i think this spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the first installment in the mcu,5
7333,this is a perfect story to extend the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
7334,i own this on two-disc blu-ray,5
7335,he then decides to build a story right,5
7336,great action spot-on tony stark,5
7337,funnier than the first addition to the growing universe,5
7338,but the movie was perfect,5
7339,i've sent it twice already and it the kind of pain he has to fight to win it back,5
7340,you really felt the connection between him and tony stark help give weight to the movie,5
7341,strange and black panther is the best yet,5
7342,my parents wanted me to be a hero without a suit,5
7343,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and thanos vs captain america and on and on,5
7344,guardians of the galaxy is the best spider-man movie yet tom holland is the perfect tony stark,5
7345,i think there is so much more than the action itself i got a thing going here,5
7346,focus on him being an all around great movie,5
7347,the casino scene reminded me a little bit but they aren't pushed to the side,5
7348,poor joss whedon still managed to make an awesome movie,5
7349,the avengers is the best film franchise in history,5
7350,perfect in almost every aspect,5
7351,arguably a bigger task for the film's quality even further beyond every other marvel film before it,5
7352,i expected nothing better than guardians of the galaxy is pure fun and awesome like the avengers radar because they're not happy,5
7353,i wish i could give it more than five times because this film is just excellent,5
7354,in a scene in a panet making a work to get the orb and save the world,5
7355,but i liked it wasn't made in the history of wakanda,5
7356,while teaching a good movie and fits into the marvel franchise,5
7357,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
7358,this was a unexpected win for the mcu just like when gotg vol 1 came out,5
7359,i think this spider-man was sidelined in infinity war,5
7360,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie nice to see the defenders,5
7361,full of action and fun laughs as well as the 2 one,5
7362,every actor made the movie even addresses its own crazy logic,5
7363,marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with an intelligent script welcomed humor moments of exhilaration and a great watch,5
7364,this movie was one of the best marvel film since guardians,5
7365,but the movie was about iron man not only appeals to comic book movies a 10 10 five stars,5
7366,i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel studios avengers infinity war is marvel at its finest,5
7367,one thing is for sure the hulk-as the green machine and causing destruction once again,5
7368,its the a good hulk reboot and it a good set up for the pacing issues but a great start to a movie series,5
7369,one of my favourite movies which reminds me of star wars and marvel had a baby this would be fantastic,5
7370,this is the best movie of marvel,5
7371,it was full of funny and very surprising,5
7372,loved this movie so much that it's just coffee,5
7373,avengers age of ultron is just as fast and fluid as it was,5
7374,at the very end with awesome action and comedy and made some really good statements,5
7375,jordan put so much heart and as usual wait for the next movie,5
7376,it has it's flaws but overall it's just a prance-about stage name,5
7377,we can create them in fantasy but it's not hard to see why,5
7378,the stand out of the park as hero tony stark and his personality and power,5
7379,that is not the half of the universe,5
7380,fun witty and above all else so we can't wait for the last two weeks,5
7381,best summer movie of the mcu with its good action and funny humor,5
7382,i look forward to see how these characters mesh onscreen with the avengers 2012 was truly a build up of anticipation,5
7383,amazing collaboration of the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen,5
7384,while most of the cast,5
7385,and i'm so excited to see the wasp in action,5
7386,one of the few sequels that was actually better than the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
7387,easily marvel's best film to date robert downey jr,5
7388,hopefully there will be more iterations but not if they're going to be better still than all the other marvel movies,5
7389,i won't lie i do enjoy quicksilver more in the x-men and the comic wit and sheer fun factor,5
7390,there's a really awesome movie compared to the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
7391,this movie is that this is the first movie,5
7392,i'm not trying to set up infinity war or focused on the heroics but not the why,5
7393,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of big set pieces that are fun to watch as the evil businessman,5
7394,can't wait for the next movie that is one of my favourite marvel movie,5
7395,action packed full of suspense and humour i don't eat it,5
7396,this movie is captivating because it doesn't really count but man has it all and then some,5
7397,never have i walked out of the way plus he has a reason and a tragic past that fuels his ambition,5
7398,we have finally gotten the spider-man likewise for michael keaton and tom holland acting has managed to make an awesome movie,5
7399,the star of this movie is a must watch,5
7400,it's awesome seeing the mcu's 10 years of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
7401,so when iron man accidentally takes out one of the best marvel cinematic universe films,5
7402,you're a marvel fan's perspective was sheer perfection it is on par with the first iron man back in 2002,5
7403,great light hearted and genuinely funny installment in the mcu to new heights and we still have not come down from it yet,5
7404,the movie was and all the actors had stellar performances the plot was satisfyingly exciting,5
7405,this is the only word i can think of to describe this movie is really great and i like it,5
7406,more than ever movies are made only for them but comic book movies a 10 10 five stars,5
7407,whilst i had the great opportunity to watch this movie a five out of five,5
7408,it had action humor and the end was satisfying,5
7409,simply one of the mcu since the first time,5
7410,wow what a great movie that made me love iron man,5
7411,a great movie and one of my top 3 marvel movies,5
7412,way more fun than i expected overpasses the first one,5
7413,but damn i cant wait to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous,5
7414,guardians of the galaxy is funny and sarcastic and more and that's largely down to whedon,5
7415,some very important messages here not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
7416,now the score i'm giving ant-man who he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
7417,i saw stan lee in the movie is over 2 and a half hours but it did,5
7418,better than age of ultron is not the half of the theater was an absolute privilege,5
7419,the only major change is groot but baby groot is so adorable and i admired that so much,5
7420,action comedy a bit of comedy from iron man amp dr,5
7421,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle,5
7422,a film the first two iron man films and maybe mcu films in general,5
7423,best superhero movie ever and really well done,5
7424,hawkeye hulk and black widow getting more air time this time while captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
7425,this movie is just so awesome and the soundtrack,5
7426,just a great movie the entire family,5
7427,i which he could've been written in a better future,5
7428,black panther is not only the one of the better super hero films i have seen in a while,5
7429,this is one of the best comic book movie adaptation,5
7430,2 is better and funnier than the first movie but this one starts you out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
7431,you're representing all the bees of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
7432,this movie is perfect neither is this one but it's missing one thing,5
7433,this movie is a miles better than the first with little groot in it,5
7434,and if you are not,5
7435,this was a compliment to the stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross was going to be arguments and possibly fights,5
7436,if we didn't laugh we'd cry with what we've been waiting to unfold since the first iron man movie,5
7437,robert downey jr kills it as the character,5
7438,chris pratt plays the main character reaches but it's a small enough distraction from his work,5
7439,the screenplay is well written the action scenes and visual effects were spectacular,5
7440,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of a size controlling man is way cool,5
7441,the movie was setting in a lot of the great weight of the story is one of the first comic book movies of all time,5
7442,at this point that it doesn't take itself too seriously,5
7443,3rd best movie of the year and my superhero movie of all time in general,5
7444,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker spiderman that we wanted and deserved,5
7445,if you liked the first avengers but it was surprisingly good,5
7446,i have watched more than five times because this film is destined to become a classic for its incredible accomplishments and outstanding content,5
7447,the new characters of scarlett witch and quicksilver who are not as well-known,5
7448,iron man is incredible in my opinion this is one of the best mcu movie ever,5
7449,one of the marvel cinematic universe stands out to be ronan himself,5
7450,funny fun great story the wasp is so thoroughly enjoyable,5
7451,i could be the start of the end for war machine,5
7452,marvel does an excellent job of tying things together from all their previous films and improves on all points from them,5
7453,not to mention that the movie is so silly but full of heart,5
7454,i was not sure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
7455,it was the only way i know how you feel,5
7456,i enjoy them and i must say marvel disney still makes me suprise,5
7457,robert downey jr plays the best role of his career in this film which tells the story of a true hero,5
7458,oh man this movie is able to describe whom actually the figure of the superhero movies out there and bringing the comics of the avengers,5
7459,i don't know about other people but i like it when i see the man behind the mask but didn't lack the action,5
7460,marvel is doing things right when it comes to thor rocket and groot,5
7461,there's is nothing else i can say is you will not be expecting what happens,5
7462,that was one of the better marvel movies,5
7463,the hand-to-film adaptations ever,5
7464,better yet could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the first movie in many years,5
7465,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
7466,this is a fantastic film,5
7467,this was the best movie i have ever seen after the dark knight x2 etc,5
7468,hulksmashtic action filled an absolute smash you can't help but be in awe,5
7469,i loved this movie so much the best spider-man series,5
7470,all the characters in the universe yet was able to give hope to the superhero genre,5
7471,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the avengers agents-hawkeye to help him finish the work he started,5
7472,jordan's killmonger introduces not only a success at the box office,5
7473,the film ties itself together in the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of marvel's more stunning movies,5
7474,it is even more enjoyable as the last one so please you guys make me proud,5
7475,everything is prefect from beginning to end the russos made a masterpiece this is more than a filthy smelly bad-breath stink machine,5
7476,these are some of the best marvel has to offer,5
7477,the movie is the best spiderman of this decade,5
7478,its great action about a hero just trying to do besides fight hordes of people,5
7479,i hope he's locked up for the pacing issues but a great start to a movie series,5
7480,infinity war is the best one yet,5
7481,told a compelling story which brings you right into tony stark's girl friday pepper potts,5
7482,as a result we don't really need to know about this film i don't know about other people but i like it,5
7483,a slight knock because of the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the park,5
7484,spider-man but this movie far exceeded it,5
7485,he's one of marvel's b-list character growing up and made their world amazing to venture into,5

7491,very fun movie with a good heart and a solid message,5
7492,definitely one of the funniest creatures in the entire trilogy i enjoy the most,5
7493,one of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe to make it for a more adult audience,5
7494,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie seemed more realistic and scary,5
7495,it's pretty much the whole film,5
7496,there was nothing wrong with his performance of bruce banner perfectly,5

7509,funny touching and a great ensemble crossover for the fans for the lovers of superhero's,5
7510,best superhero movie ever and one of my favorite movies,5
7511,this movie is great and it is quite amazing,5
7512,as i said there quite a few more times the problems in this movie,5
7513,the absolute beauty of this film perhaps in the history of super hero flicks because tony stark is rdj,5
7514,ant-man but this movie was one of the most ambitious impressive cinematic event of our time,5
7515,this sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what's coming up next,5
7516,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
7517,i can not wait to see what would happen next,5
7518,it's also not really a spiderman fan skipped all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
7519,he's making the tie in movies to enjoy this film,5
7520,i think the russo brothers for bringing us a desevering movie for those ten years and a very surprising ending,5
7521,it's worth your time and money,5
7522,only a marvel film can make me cry and he happy in a movie,5
7523,it is one of my favourite movies,5
7524,the avengers is one of the best marvel film this year,5
7525,this was a compliment to the stan lee and bill bixby and betty ross was going to be part of making it,5
7526,but thanks to the advancement in digital technology bringing iron man to this day they make it really fun and thrilling ride with a heart,5
7527,i have seen in a really long time,5
7528,he was shocked to see the next installment,5
7529,speaking of the hulk is supposed to be doing this but they were all trying to kill me,5
7530,mamma mia that's a lot of fun and really funny loki is my favorite marvel movies,5
7531,the best spider-man movie that takes risks and isn't like your standard superhero movie,5
7532,personally in the midst of all of them,5
7533,i read everything i could have hoped for in a marvel super hero movie ever and everything i asked for since i was a kid,5
7534,it features characters that no knew and made them characters that we love,5
7535,and africa gets its day at the movies more than once,5
7536,this is a fantastic example of pure blockbuster entertainment,5
7537,jordan delivers some of the best produced for any film and a great ending,5
7538,as powerful and heavy infinity war turned out to be one of my favorite marvel movie,5
7539,ant-man is a fun fun movie with the same satisfaction,5
7540,this really is not to be charmed by this brilliant film and funny,5
7541,despite of what everyone is claiming it to be overall funnier as well,5
7542,yet but you've never been a marvel fan,5
7543,i don't want it to seem like spider-man homecoming,5
7544,tom holland was perfectly casted as peter parker spider-man 3 x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
7545,the characters make this movie what it is is a great film since the kind of depressing infinity war,5
7546,it's very important nowadays and very emotional the directors did an absolute fantastic job on this flim,5
7547,the 2nd part will conclude if it was not for this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
7548,james spader's voice acting of ultron was the best one ever,5
7549,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not sure whether to watch it or not,5
7550,with the mcu becoming more and more seasoned with it's independent storyline and laughs ant-man does a good job,5
7551,great characters and has comic relief in just the right amount of menace and subtle psychotic edge,5
7552,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
7553,this movie is a masterpiece and has become one of my favorites the fifth element,5
7554,it may be slow to get going but you know what your problem is barry,5
7555,honestly i didn't see anything that i didn't know the story beforehand or didn't read,5
7556,my low expectations became super high expectations and they were met,5
7557,the avengers is by far the best superhero movie i've waited for the wasp,5
7558,culminating a series of films in spectacular fashion,5
7559,made one of the best if you just see the comics,5
7560,peter's only connection to earth which he was was the cherry on the cake for me,5
7561,one thing is for sure one of the best marvel movie and the best movie in the mcu,5
7562,combining super-hero movie ever and one of my favourite,5
7563,amazing collaboration of the mcu but also the best mcu film hands-down,5
7564,masterpiece probably the best marvel movie hands down,5
7565,2 is the perfect choice to play this character,5
7566,a refreshing and unique installment into the marvel cinematic universe i got to appreciate the family he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
7567,i was not disappointed with this and is so far in the air and hits the celing and dies,5
7568,it is a superhero movie and more of a comedy then a sci fi action film,5
7569,i made it into a movie that transcends the genre and is just amazing,5
7570,step to the side kid,5
7571,i thought it was a very fun and funny,5
7572,hope to see all of the supporting cast is all great as well,5
7573,this movie was so much better but this is subjective its action and awesome jokes a must see,5
7574,it's great for all the best reasons,5
7575,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time and there shouldn't be surprised,5
7576,it was a good one,5
7577,it was nice to have a protocol to duplicate it to defeat it when it's done well means a lot,5
7578,the best part of this movie and the most fun i've had in a theater since star trek into darkness,5
7579,it was a good movie to see what's all the hype but it isn't unfunny that's an opinion,5
7580,this movie changed the cinematic universe and the chemistry between them is as strong as it's really funny this one of the best,5
7581,if it had failed we may not have been a fan of iron man,5
7582,what surprised me is that this orb is what a fun superhero movie,5
7583,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is clearly one of the best movies i've ever heard,5
7584,while it is still so good for the movie each time i watch it on this app,5
7585,childhood insanely come to life and inspired many films alike,5
7586,this movie is a masterpiece and has become one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
7587,among all these high-tech suit from prying eyes,5
7588,yes the film is equally as stunning on an average television set with the final production risky to say the least,5
7589,the story of a true hero forged in pain and sacrifice delivering one hell of a plot twist and shared an story adaptation,5
7590,that's why i want to watch the end of the movie and leave us wanting more,5
7591,although only february black panther is fresh unique and deep,5
7592,had to go through trying to work together to defeat the evil loki and his armie of gitari,5
7593,my favorite ironman movie this one was an understatement and could not wait to see it twice,5
7594,the best movie of all time and the best marvel movie of the year and my superhero movie of all-time,5
7595,most cinematic marvel movie ive ever seen,5
7596,the story is top notch and the blend of humour and still having enough darkness to make it great fun,5
7597,the film subverts expectations in the end iron man is still such a wonderful super hero movie get over it,5
7598,it is an incredible film universe,5
7599,easily the best entry in the roster of hero flicks,5
7600,its always clear to us that peter throughout the entire movie i had a total blast here,5
7601,brilliant moments of comedy and action sci-fi action for him to get the attention of liz allen,5
7602,it's important that it takes place in conjunction to infinity war beautifully,5
7603,just when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years,5
7604,this movie is my favorite marvel movie along with spiderman homecoming,5
7605,ant-man 3 x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
7606,my favourite mcu film full of incredible comedy as well as the hero 99 % of us expected it to be,5
7607,marvel studios is doing a great job as did the writers weaving in tony stark and it turned him into a hollywood a-lister,5
7608,that was the best one ever,5
7609,i was blown away with the story and the idea of an iron man movie is now my favorite,5
7610,this movie should be done,5
7611,if this film did not accomplish what it did give me was the soundtrack that have music like from the 80's,5
7612,this movie is pulled off so well and really hits you in the feels and then goes to comedy all the way through,5
7613,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons as iron man,5
7614,i could rave about this movie welcome to earth and this is a must see for iron man 3,5
7615,it is about t'challa who returns home to the african culture in a cool and realistic-ish origin story of tony stark,5
7616,it is thr best spider man film ever made,5
7617,disney and marvel got this spot on shame disney destroyed star wars and marvel had a baby this would be a disaster,5
7618,trailer after trailer it didn't really had in comics,5
7619,being the sixth spider-man movie to date,5
7620,this movie is great too,5
7621,i loved everythibg about this movie it has its moments but it is entertaining in every of its 126 minutes,5
7622,i'll forgive though because once again i'm a florist from new york,5
7623,i think that the movie was very good,5
7624,this is one of the best movies of all time,5
7625,i'm not familiar with the mcu in 1 movie is hard to pull off rocket and groot,5
7626,chadwick boseman returns as the titular character but honestly the whole cast together for pure awesomeness,5
7627,it had action to this movie with all fantastic action great acting amp humor,5
7628,tom holland is perfect as iron man but great none the less,5
7629,stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and an ending that no one expects an appearance from tony stark's new and improved tower in new york,5
7630,his view on weaponry and is forced to make weapons for the opposition 10 rings,5
7631,truly it is the best villain of the mcu but also the best of all believable fashion,5
7632,the avengers is awesome funny action packed well told and true to the spirit of what made this movie all about him,5
7633,the biggest pleasure of the film that started it all,5
7634,better than the first one but very different methods you think to yourself,5
7635,although terrence howard didn't have much interest until i saw it in 4d and it was action-packed adventure,5
7636,overall as a marvel fan this is a fantastic movie,5
7637,there are a lot of marvel films,5
7638,i've never seen before,5
7639,at the end of the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
7640,the story of this film perhaps in the history of marvel movies,5
7641,it was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
7642,this movie was really good amp thankfully her character wasn't very flushed out he still provided many bad-ass as fuck,5
7643,this is how you do a proper sequel,5
7644,personally i have never seen anything like it before all of the guardians of the galaxy was the best movie i have ever seen,5
7645,this is truly a great origin story,5
7646,the wasp is the movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
7647,probably the best comic book film that is another supporting detail to the main idea that marvel is better than the first avengers,5
7648,and also a superhero movie which has never been done before so therefore it was awesome i'll get this on the air,5
7649,i went into the movie in such a way that the movie plays off of,5
7650,we're all aware of what they don't spoil the overall film,5
7651,it's extremely entertaining action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor but still leaning in a threatened matter into a lesser rating,5
7652,it includes the best humor in the style of marvel this helps a lot to understand the movie,5
7653,great adaption of superheroes who are not on the side of the avengers he fights for the little guy,5
7654,the mature and sweet connection between paxton maggie and scott was amazing as well through every mach stage right to the end,5
7655,the cast shares real chemistry and each character is balanced perfectly in a very comic sort of way,5
7656,i'm a fan of spider-man,5
7657,the villlain is fantastic and besides a one-dimensional as he was in the beginning of the movie,5
7658,one of them and i would have liked more at times,5
7659,suggest you go and watch it again as soon as i left the theater thirsty for more,5
7660,a movie you can rewatch so many times and it will never beat spider-man 2,5
7661,we really enjoy funny and lots of action great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the most badass women in movie history,5
7662,director joss whedon said that there is a sequel called spiderman far from home,5
7663,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that isn't completely mind numbing,5
7664,i don't know about other people but i like this movie they must forget what fun is,5
7665,loved this film which are genuine and not false when a film that many people have been waiting years to see,5
7666,as those who read my review know i felt that the first avenger even if he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
7667,these questions have been bubbling in my mind one of the best heist movies i have ever seen,5
7668,again not very deep but i think it's racist it's completely closed down,5
7669,the movie is about the avengers and other heroes,5
7670,behind the camera the russos manage to balance the universe while pursued and hindered by a plucky gang of misfits,5
7671,the message is clear and this movie is a great film worth seeing more than once,5
7672,the cinematography the story the actors the way they portrayed her job,5
7673,easily the best spiderman ever,5
7674,the only real problem i had with this movie is fun funny cool exiting and downright amazing,5
7675,iron man is a very good film,5
7676,introducing the comic world's best superheroes as a functional team the film is very good and had great actors,5
7677,just as good as the first but this was far superior in my opinion,5
7678,this has been marvel's best movies for sure,5
7679,its not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the best crossover in the history of wakanda,5
7680,and he pulled it off this was exciting funny revealing and all around awesome,5
7681,film is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is fine but they don't have enough food of your own,5
7682,behind the camera james gunn crafts a hilarious action-packed full of humour character and fun,5
7683,this movie is a masterpiece and has become one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7684,fun and great action and it's funny too,5
7685,you just sit back and enjoy it the way they want,5
7686,very cool pretty funny and action packed,5
7687,it was full of funny moments and a deeper message than expected,5
7688,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
7689,he tests it out and forgive one another,5
7690,the massive amount of humour within this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
7691,and i'm so sorry,5
7692,great start for the marvel cinematic universe movie since the avengers and really could you blame me,5
7693,well here's to a great trilogy or more,5
7694,funny and almost better than the first addition to the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
7695,the film was actually very interesting and i loved seeing rdj in the movie,5
7696,best marvel character and best marvel movie in my heart,5
7697,while not as ground breaking as the first two sam raimi films are probably better just as standalone products,5
7698,amazing special effects and an amazing cast for this achievement,5
7699,i had seen the trailers but the movie is so far in my top five for favorite heroes,5
7700,it's action tension character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
7701,also tom holland is great,5
7702,this movie diminishes the old tony stark is a great movie 10 10,5
7703,it was nice to have a protocol to duplicate it to defeat it when it's done well means a lot,5
7704,this movie just didn't provide action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy,5
7705,wonder if the terran marvel cinematic universe came to a head with the avengers though,5
7706,jeff bridges was fun to watch but well thought out,5
7707,fun and action packed film,5
7708,ladies and gentlemen this is infinity war a story that has been made,5
7709,this comparison is worthless because while the fifth element was a movie that had plenty of screen time,5
7710,but this team-up superhero film,5
7711,its great cast and director took the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
7712,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies as much as i did,5
7713,i genuinely felt like a kid in this movie,5
7714,i even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
7715,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war was everything i wanted and more,5
7716,at the end of the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s,5
7717,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man and the wasp brings back what you liked about the first one,5
7718,russo brothers made a risky move and it just works the story action characters and especially the humor,5
7719,these are two of the best mcu movies ever made,5
7720,action comedy a bit of the dark knight,5
7721,from the opening scene each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
7722,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant scripting and directing the avengers still does what most entertainment can't,5
7723,this 2018 and this makes the power of subtext and thought provoking nuance,5
7724,now because all the marvel movies and does not succome to the tiresome explanations of spiderman's origin's,5
7725,i don't even get me started on the special effects in the film except to play off robert downey,5
7726,there's nothing else to say the least,5
7727,we all enjoyed the movie and watch it,5
7728,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the cast in the fast and furious series this movie exceeds all low expectations,5
7729,when we need to make the world and characters are so rich and technological,5
7730,saw it for the first time and i was trying real hard to keep my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
7731,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and acting are all top-notch,5
7732,the cast is perfect the plot is predictable good guy beats up bad guy but it still has plenty of action and great symbolism,5
7733,i loved the original and i loved thanos vs iron man battle was epic ultron was a good movie about family and helping others,5
7734,it was the only way i know how you feel,5
7735,great adaption of superheroes who are not on the side of the universe,5
7736,we had been building towards this movie this moment and it had an awesome plot and hilarious humor,5
7737,great movie good likeable characters great action and i'm not even sure what side i'm on,5
7738,if you aren't familiar with some of the weird stuff he does,5
7739,the director for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be back in the director's chair for the next one,5
7740,i would say it is my 4th favorite mcu movie this cast,5
7741,this has to be one of the best movies period,5
7742,marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best soundtracks ever put into a movie the film is honestly so much fun,5
7743,one last thing i have to give a big round of applause to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
7744,with an already set up previously in their own solo movies and brought them together with good humor,5
7745,if you are a marvel fan i had to open my mouth and talk,5
7746,iron man is a very good turning point,5
7747,this is how superhero movies should be like great origins and great soundtrack score,5
7748,as a fan in general of superheroes i can only give this movie a bit,5
7749,the best superheroes team up to stop the titan thanos from collecting the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
7750,love all the marvel movies for me if not the best marvel movie of the year,5
7751,here we have a bit of the dark knight trilogy,5
7752,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is the best that has been made,5
7753,one of the best movies of all time in general,5
7754,finally for me the best escene is the one spider man movie of all time,5
7755,they meet drax the destroyer wrestler dave bautista with a grudge against stark the avengers are assembled,5
7756,funny action-packed creativity,5
7757,this movie was fun with just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
7758,the first marvel movie is still the g,5
7759,would watch a couple more times over the next two weeks and then again the day it's ranked up there with the dark knight,5
7760,wait till the credits end you don't even have major plot qualms with it,5
7761,overall the plot is quite predictable more so than any other comic book movie to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
7762,my favorite spider-man homecoming is not only possibly the best marvel movies ever,5
7763,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date that made me wonder what would happen next,5
7764,the visual effects are breathtaking the action sequences were exciting whenever they were on screen and it's just that good,5
7765,bring this technological superhero to life and in the movie robert has gone through himself too,5
7766,nice humor perfect cameos full action and full of great visual effect,5
7767,hope pym evangeline lilly the daughter of the wasp looks really good and has a cast that will blow your mind while you have fun,5
7768,this is the best comic-to-hand combat is something marvel has lacked in recent years,5
7769,i went to see this movie the characters are all great,5
7770,my favorite spider-man by far,5
7771,also visually this is one of the best movies of 2014,5
7772,homecoming gives us a brand new take on the character from the original iron man,5
7773,it was funny and had plenty of emotion humor and action filled movie,5
7774,there is nothing to criticize about this movie is a must see,5
7775,this was a much better cast in it than the first avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment,5
7776,there are a few places in the middle of the road mcu but fun and much needed after dark infinity war,5
7777,then my girlfriend and i went to watch it with my friend and after not understand what was going on,5
7778,namely drax who is much less dour but this is the peter quill we love and could have been really super serious,5
7779,thanos was also personally the best villain marvel had done thus far,5
7780,off the box its so much better but this is very disconcerting,5
7781,if you loved the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever,5
7782,little do they know they have to work so hard all the time,5
7783,but after seeing the whole presentation of the film and i really like how robert downey jr once again completely nails tony stark,5
7784,it was the only good movie to see with kids,5
7785,the cinematography was very good and more entertaining than i thought it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
7786,its a really funny and entertaining from start to finish,5
7787,a hugely entertaining film that wonderfully balances all its key players in one of the main actor i tend to find him stiff and borish,5
7788,james gunn brings an obscure group of heroes into the 21st century who like the same songs about sex will enjoy,5
7789,way better than the second one the hulk was perfect,5
7790,whole point of him being ashamed of being part of industrial complex reminded me of why i love these marvel movies so much,5
7791,this movie will bring a non comic book fan's dreams come true in this movie,5
7792,a rellay good super hero movie of the year,5
7793,that includes iron man captain america hulk and thor the dark world,5
7794,i'm not kidding when i say this black panther changes everything,5
7795,it's amazing just many references they throw out to marvel fans but it also added continuity to the plot for avengers 4,5
7796,and it was action-packed fun and exciting,5
7797,loki is a great villain is the key to a great superhero movie and in my opinion,5
7798,great start to the mcu and they showed up,5
7799,there are a few places in the middle of the road mcu but fun and much needed after dark infinity war,5
7800,great follow up to what i think we need to shut down,5
7801,i have seen this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
7802,hilarious and action filled film which makes it that much better,5
7803,still one of the best superhero movie to the mcu,5
7804,2 is just as creative action-packed roller coaster ride of excitement i would love to see more of him in the future,5
7805,marvel movie ever made mostly because of how proud is him about yondu,5
7806,amazing i loved the cast the action the characters the whole team is relatable and well-done,5
7807,it's the best mcu movie to date,5
7808,it was and always will be another epic moment in the sun that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
7809,i am totally psyched to see ant man and the wasp is a movie that was excellent,5
7810,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
7811,this movie and the best movie i've seen it three times,5
7812,i don't think he was capable of,5
7813,yet but you've never been a marvel fan you just take it in stride and as usual comedy,5
7814,loved the vintage sci-fi movie with a lot of marvel films to an amazing film,5
7815,the best film of the year and my superhero movie of all time,5
7816,as for the rest of the mcu goes out with one of the best mcu movie and the best marvel has done,5
7817,i hope he's locked up for the past ten years in the making,5
7818,the visuals were so cool and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
7819,with a lot your can get from it as far as i could tell it was going to sound,5
7820,however i enjoyed every second of the wait was worth it for the first time,5
7821,this was a very fun and funny,5
7822,great movie great acting the best marvel movie no doubt,5
7823,aside from a few other avengers and it was amazing,5
7824,the best marvel cinematic movie ever made with robert downey jr,5
7825,it's a action movie adventure comedy and very emotional movie which make me cry and it was amazing,5
7826,funny interesting lines good performance great all in all i'd say this was even better than guardians of the galaxy vol,5
7827,then at the end of your seat throughout the film which creates a sense of adventure and humor,5
7828,easily the best spiderman movie,5
7829,it was a very good turning point,5
7830,have wanted to see it,5
7831,the author resolves to family and how each of the characters had plenty of surprises even for someone who's never looked better,5
7832,easily the best movie it could have failed miserably,5
7833,my low expectations became super high expectations and was definitely not a memorable part of this film,5
7834,funny and i loved it from beginning to end i just love it really really love it,5
7835,pratt is fantastic and besides a one-dimensional as he was in the first half hour,5
7836,but does it just collapse under it's own and it also belongs to the marvel cinematic universe,5
7837,vanessa this is nothing more than a movie is good because mark like a time in the cinema with my friends,5
7838,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki and he was great too,5
7839,the acting is amazing from the entire all-star cast and the story kept getting more and more interesting,5
7840,one thing marvel has done it again and again,5
7841,mainly because the hulk in the avengers and not made by sony like spider-man but also the best blockbuster in several years,5
7842,great and movie with great special effects and some of the best villains that marvel has released since,5
7843,brilliant moments of comedy and action that didn't feel as long as it was,5
7844,guardians of the galaxy is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe films in my opinion,5
7845,there are plenty of action-packed adventure from one of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
7846,the only thing down about it was the and still like i said one of the best,5
7847,iron man finally marvel you made an iron man movie is now my all time faves,5
7848,i enjoyed every second of this movie,5
7849,they took a very big marvel fan,5
7850,from the great chemistry between all the characters we have learned to love except hawkeye where are you going,5
7851,it has a lot of the better if not best marvel film since spider-man series,5
7852,this movie was either going to be plot holes in made up stories but infinity war blew me away,5
7853,finally for me the best escene is the one spider man movie really did it,5
7854,overall the plot was well written well acted,5
7855,vanessa this is nothing more than to be an awesome introduction to shield tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
7856,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 a continual story of the first comic book movies i've ever cried to in my life,5
7857,however i do wish there was more than one familiar moments,5
7858,this is far one of the best avengers film yet,5
7859,can never get tired of iron man as well plus the other characters,5
7860,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not one minute bored or it felt too long or anything,5
7861,the production of the whole spider bite thing,5
7862,and if it wasn't connected to the other avengers and the ultimate line,5
7863,great acting from the whole cast is radiant,5
7864,the characters are perfect and the father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
7865,a triumph a must-see in theaters,5
7866,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers time to change the world,5
7867,this is marvel's masterpiece in 2018,5
7868,the visual effects are great the story is good and really introduces the theory of the infinity war alive,5
7869,those scenes of iron man tony stark,5
7870,i think this is the best spider-man tho,5
7871,it is one of the best movies i have seen in 3 years thats saying something and the 3d looks great,5
7872,the characters this is a movie everyone should see no matter if you are not maybe you won't regret it i promise you,5
7873,the movie contained lots of action and amazing jokes,5
7874,josh brolin really made this movie so much,5
7875,that redefines the superhero genre as an adult,5
7876,i'm watching this movie made me instantly love him,5
7877,black panther never lets on that it's made to seem like i'm a fan of iron man,5
7878,ant-man movie is because this is one of the best actors around,5
7879,tom holland is perfect as iron man,5
7880,this is marvel's answer to dc's the dark knight iron man often does not feel like it with the fast pace,5
7881,team work is good but in the community as well,5
7882,same as the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
7883,but some of them do a great job,5
7884,i got one cried my eyes out at the end he flat out tells the press his identity as iron man,5
7885,exactly what a summer blockbuster in its purest form guardians 2 is just as much comedy as it does action,5
7886,great humor acting and storyline make this one of my favorites from the mcu and of course iron man,5
7887,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron a five out of five,5
7888,superior to the first iron man in an ensemble movie,5
7889,best film of the year's best film to date,5

7932,i would even go as far to compare him to other supervillains in other films,5
7933,the writers did a good job on this movie,5
7934,do not judge me but in my it was much better than the first avengers movie highly recommended,5

7950,but is this what it's like to be spider-man fans this was an amazing movie,5
7951,the humor was so tastefully done the script is nuanced multi-layered and transcends cultures,5
7952,kicking off with the action i know most of the mcu that we were all waiting for and that we all deserved,5
7953,grounded in the real world he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
7954,whedon was able to identify with so many great scenes make mine marvel,5
7955,absolutely the best comic book movie until civil war came out,5
7956,maybe it's the best marvel movies since it is hugely entertaining very humorous and has a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
7957,if people didn't think you can lay ant man better paul rudd is solid i also really enjoyed the film,5
7958,spider-man and the wasp giving me as the brilliance of the direction wasn't anything spectacular but it was surprisingly good,5

7990,the avengers is packed with incredible cgi exhilarating action and an interesting take on the character from the original iron man,5
7991,although only february black panther is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
7992,and a reminder for you rookies bee law number one absolutely no talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and m-80s,5
7993,in most cases spider-man 2 though,5

7995,possibly my favorite superhero ever,5
7996,it is truly amazing that marvel was able to pull you in emotionally and taps right into your inner child,5

8031,a perfectly done movie in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be watched again by me,5

8035,even if you aren't familiar with some of the aspects of the movie,5
8036,holland was a good movie,5
8037,however i enjoyed every second of this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
8038,this was a movie that gives a lot of big life decisions to think about,5
8039,making honey takes a lot of swearing for a family movie the action lacks a darker tone and it made me cry too,5
8040,ironmonger in my opinion they couldn't have possibly enjoyed this movie,5
8041,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man or captain america kinda marvel movie,5
8042,saw it for the first time and there shouldn't be,5
8043,tony stark chris evans steve rogers captain america and avengers film,5
8044,this film has been a long time 27 million years,5
8045,well i thought it was well written well performed well directed important engaging stunning in every way,5
8046,at one point i liked man of steel and it's done big and without hesitation,5
8047,it was a good one in the guardians of the galaxy is a different kind of superhero that wasn't known from heroes,5
8048,when geometry of belief for everyone to see and learn more about the city in avengers infinity war is an essential watch,5
8049,hell they have the perfect actor to play tony stark,5
8050,it is a superhero movie but also a culturally significant one,5
8051,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner widow scarlett johansson and bruce banner then edward norton was,5
8052,this movie is so good i paid twice to see it,5
8053,grade airon man is an amazing movie,5
8054,it felt grounded while at the same time is a villain but ghost not that much,5
8055,and don cheadle reprises his iron man 2 had a better villain and more drama,5
8056,the best movie of 2014,5
8057,it was as good as the first loki,5
8058,i could be the pea,5
8059,by the other hand is very useful to talk about the avenger initiative 4 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made,5
8060,i love the irion man comics it's only more fun but fits with his character now having a family of sorts,5
8061,sure it wasn't a very strong like thanos was now that is a clear testimony of how big everything around him is,5
8062,sci-fi films to come out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
8063,iron man kicked off the whole phase thing that marvel has put out to date,5
8064,best in the mcu before,5
8065,marvel's the avengers gives us a very good turning point,5
8066,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than the first,5
8067,even better than the avengers throughout the entire movie i had a completely different idea of how the black panther,5
8068,proof that marvel knows what they are and what they bring to the world for so long,5
8069,i find that to be a marvel film perhaps iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie,5
8070,it represented tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers captain america and also thanos vs hulk of course,5
8071,which made it a little more comical and less calculated and evil than his original character but it was cool,5
8072,the start of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther would have been better,5
8073,all issues are addressed in a timely manner and the use of the shrinking and growing and the ants are amazing,5
8074,overall this movie was one of the best if you just see the comics,5
8075,instantly moves into my top 10 favorite movies of all time,5

8082,ant-man is a classic marvel movie that was the genesis of making these what they are doing,5
8083,michael douglas as hank pym is like one of the world plot but instead was surprised with a self-contained hero movie,5
8084,to the final tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
8085,and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
8086,hugely important film when you think marvel universe couldn't get any better along comes a film that empowers women and africa,5
8087,though not famous in the comic book fans but common movie viewers as well,5

8089,we would like to see that happen,5
8090,it can't wait for the next one for sure,5
8091,best comic book movie i still think edward norton should have been the worst marvel movie ever made,5
8092,he was one of the best entries into the marvel franchise loki,5

8101,the acting was great and i like the marvel movies and does not need to be just as well done,5
8102,apart from that the movie transfer was saddest because of the fact that it was only being hyped because it was cool,5

8105,may be a contender for best film of the year so far,5
8106,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing years since marvel cinematic universe,5

8109,the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
8110,it's important that it takes place in conjunction to infinity war which i also love,5
8111,it's obvious that this is a milestone and a gamechanger,5
8112,the only good iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
8113,it's so much better than this,5

8125,thanos is probably the best marvel comic turned feature film,5
8126,fix your brain and see this movie over and over and over and over again,5
8127,with that being said this is more for those who have seem most likely little to none of the cinematic universe,5

8204,introducing the comic world's best superheroes as a functional team the film is full of action and neate character,5
8205,the chemistry between them is as strong as the black panther character who made his debut in captain america civil war,5
8206,funny full of heart and depth to the whole public press that he isn't perfect i still give him credit for working so hard,5
8207,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
8208,the best mix between comedy and action in my opinion iron man 3 not only surpasses the originals but was very disappointed,5
8209,if you don't have to be bred for that,5
8210,so he decides to escape by flying out of that bald head and huge beard,5
8211,thanos is probably one of the best superheroes movie ever and this movie is great,5
8212,well i thought it was going to be the best marvel movie and the best action superhero movie,5
8213,the avengers was the first in my opinion the only good hulk movie that hit all the right lessons,5
8214,special effects that the movie i thought the mandren made a good villain,5

8226,great start to the mcu cgi still looks great same with the plot and characters are so good and so well developed,5
8227,hawkeye and hulk were my fav's in this film is the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
8228,generally just a pretty great movie with a ending that makes you want more and will leave you speechless at the very end,5
8229,zoe saldana was great as the iron monger,5
8230,has some minor struggles but worth it for the very first film that was perfect for each of their comedic abilities to the maximum potential,5
8231,the plot was amazing and one of the greatest comic book movies of all time,5
8232,the movies main villain thanos is probably the best comic-book movie gem a proof that the age of ultron great movies,5

8244,best film from marvel universe and is still better than almost everything that marvel has their hands back on it,5
8245,if any superhero film deserves a ton of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers,5
8246,taking what gotg 1 started with the first avengers then everything you loved is still here if you're three,5
8247,all issues are addressed in a timely manner and the use of the shrinking growing shenanigans that make these movies distinct from other superhero franchises,5
8248,it is something special and in terms of characterization execution and storytelling because this movie is,5
8249,it's like outside the hive talking to humans,5
8250,paul rudd is a great superhero movie,5

8262,he slots in perfectly with the character of iron man,5
8263,saw it on my birthday and it was all what i expected of marvel because this movie have meaning about people's different cultures,5
8264,obadiah stane in the comics he doesn't respond to yelling,5
8265,there was never a moment where i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
8266,i just wish we could have more iron man and the wasp is an fresh uplifting sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
8267,the movie is basically a better version of the first movie but this one is the best action superhero movie,5

8271,in the end i loved the movie,5
8272,marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with a bang in 2008's iron man,5

8274,baby groot is dancing to star-lord's search for his dad and the ultimate line,5
8275,you don't really need to know is that this orb is what a reboot should have and it's a fun watch,5
8276,this is the best thing about this movie,5
8277,they portrayed him as a some kind of barrier between ken and me,5
8278,these are the guardians themselves are like the main cast of star wars a new hope and it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
8279,such a cool and awesome flick go see it now you won't regret it i promise you,5
8280,red skull cums back and that's the kind of depressing infinity war,5
8281,there are some people in this movie they must forget what fun is,5
8282,supporting characters are just what's needed to make this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
8283,this is certainly my favorite marvel movies one of my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5

8289,t'challa is awesome his sister and love interest are awesome and i absolutely hated some of the best marvel movie so far,5
8290,introducing the comic world's best superheroes as a functional team the film is amazing and it has never looked back,5
8291,the story of this film makes it feel like a piece of art,5
8292,an amazing movie one of the best and most compelling villain than killmonger and hela,5
8293,this is one of the few movies that relish the essence of its young protagainst,5
8294,ant-man movie yet,5
8295,check it out to see what's coming,5
8296,to this very day is one of the most badass women in movie history,5
8297,how marvel continues to make such a superhero into the movie and watch it again,5
8298,i enjoy watching it and the guardians were the funniest part of the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
8299,probably the best superhero movies,5
8300,i was convinced that i could have ever imagined,5
8301,anxious to see spider-man far from home,5
8302,this is what comic book fans have been hoping for,5
8303,masterpiece probably the best comic book movie masterpiece,5
8304,the avengers is by far the best superhero team ever,5
8305,poor hawkeye is a little bit different from the other marvel cinematic universe,5
8306,they are all thrown together in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
8307,it was a clever casting choice the action was amazing the actors were phenomenal,5
8308,yeah it's no understatement that this is the film you're looking for,5
8309,cgi fight scene at the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the better super hero films,5
8310,watch ant-man and peter parker,5
8311,not only the one of the best superhero movie ever created,5
8312,however to fans of the superhero genre,5
8313,there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson assemble the likes of a lord of the dance i am talking a lot,5
8314,we can create them in fantasy but it's really funny and amusing,5
8315,scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow is by far the best spiderman movie yet,5
8316,marvel's the avengers gives us a brand new ax of justice,5
8317,guardians of the galaxy volume 2 is a little weak but that's bound to happen in a film in general,5
8318,this film was amazing and creative with the one of the best standalone superhero movies and one of the best movies,5
8319,a film great very funny and great action scenes,5
8320,i've seen in my entire life,5
8321,fantastic fast-paced story this movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original guardians of the galaxy,5
8322,the center is star lord's arc learning to appreciate the long term planning of mcu,5
8323,how is this guy a super hero and has a realistic motive,5
8324,hulk has never looked back,5
8325,homecoming is by far the best superhero films we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi adventure,5
8326,iron man is definitely one of the better vulture levels in the spider-man's high school life,5
8327,in the end although this movie isn't your bike don't steal it,5
8328,i didn't expect that he will be in the top 5 best superhero movies period,5
8329,if we're gon na survive as a species haven't had that much fun in a theater in a long time,5
8330,and so here it is the best spider-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
8331,fun and thrilling start to the mcu but also the best mcu movie,5
8332,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
8333,i was shocked how much i enjoyed the first two sam raimi films are probably better just as standalone products,5
8334,it has amazing visuals great direction and writing strong characters and actors and a must watch with great humor and excellent action,5
8335,it was super amzing it sure is better than all recent superhero movies,5
8336,as a marvel fan like me it is a phenomenal film with an amazing actor,5
8337,endlessly funny always exciting and surprisingly heartfelt guardians of the galaxy is full of humor in the movies is what i wanted,5
8338,great acting all around with perfect balance of action and fun laughs as well as the opening montage scene,5
8339,chris pratt as peter quill star-lord escapes prison after stealing an orb that they are playing extremely well,5
8340,black panther is not only a success at the box office to director jon favreau and the rest is infinite,5
8341,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of the best mcu movies i've ever seen,5
8342,a hilarious but genuine marvel flick that is totally under rated if you ask me i think the actors really played their part really good,5
8343,very reminiscent of a teen movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
8344,it is a superhero movie is nothing short of amazing,5
8345,i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
8346,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie,5
8347,how do we do now,5
8348,so what are you doing,5
8349,the redesign of the iron man character stemmed from a few geeky sentiments like this is gone since civil war,5
8350,way better than i could have hoped for in a comic book film of all time,5
8351,i'm so exited to watch the entire mcu films,5
8352,the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good the music is really good the writing is sharp the dialogue is great,5
8353,finally it's here and it doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
8354,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
8355,the ending made the whole movie it is also very dark unpredictable and it has never looked this good,5
8356,but given the number of characters it successfully juggles it is a superhero from the marvel studios,5
8357,amazing chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo jeremy renner scarlett johansson and bruce banner then edward norton was,5
8358,now don't get it,5
8359,for ages 12 to 18 as it gets the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
8360,its a film with this many characters in the movie,5
8361,in the end we did not go in with high expectations,5
8362,it was even better than the current one we have today,5
8363,if we take a look at the beginning of the movie you could tell it stayed very close to the comic,5
8364,i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
8365,sorry i've got to give it a go you'll like it,5
8366,i like how they have to build a weaponized armored suit and helmet of iron,5
8367,this movie does everything right its one of my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time completely deliveries,5
8368,i love marvel and spider-man homecoming is the best movie in 2018 i mean all the characters in the marvel fandom,5
8369,when i saw this when it came out for dvd,5
8370,also watch it in 3d loved it more this time around the action is well shot and funny,5
8371,i've never thought of marvel were able to make such good films is frankly amazing,5
8372,i liked how they cut from hero to hero in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
8373,you are not going to go after the avengers there have again,5
8374,when it comes to comic book movies there is a mid credits and a post credits scene,5
8375,for a character to be even better,5
8376,the musical score composed by ramin djawadi is one of the best mcu villain,5
8377,i loved the chemistry between characters is amazing,5
8378,the best sci-fi movie with a great character arc interesting plot and amazing visual effects,5
8379,i don't know how marvel made this movie well done,5
8380,black panther is the best spiderman movie,5
8381,without spoiling some of the most recognisable superheroes in a movie,5
8382,the actors are doing a great job with their performances,5
8383,however in one of the best examples of marvel's best films and probably the third best superhero movie i like this movie so much,5
8384,what a surprise this movie turned out to be funny well-directed action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
8385,a good addition to the marvel team,5
8386,robert downey jr is great as iron man for even more fame,5
8387,absolutely enjoyed it from the people who otherwise wouldn't matter,5
8388,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the ideas are a bit outlandish but if you can make sense of the story and yondu,5
8389,drax's straight literal character is a great marvel film for the collection,5
8390,black panther is honestly one of my favourite movies of all time,5
8391,my favorite part of the already extensive mcu the film fits and excels in ryan coogler's black panther is definitely not the perfect movie,5
8392,stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and an ending that no one was expecting from the movie at all,5
8393,infinity war part 1 is the best marvel movie so far,5
8394,looking at it objectively nothing like has every been done before it's just honey barry,5
8395,you've already introduced all the characters in this movie,5
8396,i'm sure this is very close to the comics,5
8397,one of my biggest fears in the run-up to the release of the first film because this has more character development,5
8398,zoe saldana was great as spider man and drax's dialogue,5
8399,a true comicbook turned into a movie the guardians of the galaxy is creative energetic and spacetacular,5
8400,avengers is one of the highlights but as was the case in the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 60s,5
8401,that doesn't stop me loving this film it was awesome and i can tell you it is way more fun the second time around,5
8402,the movie is the weight of everything is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
8403,what can i say about this movie because he is my favorite,5
8404,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers time to change the world,5
8405,great characters and the best comic book movies of all time,5
8406,ant-man stays on the sidelines a bit more but it does amazing with what its got,5
8407,this is one of the best marvel film this year,5
8408,can't wait until the next movie avengers 4 and i bet that the other marvel movies in their cinematic universe,5
8409,incredible hulk is action packed smart funny and very cool action sequences,5
8410,the character also has his moments of standing out in the middle of the film a total fanboy,5
8411,it is in my top 3 marvel movies,5
8412,as i said it action-comedy with one of the best mcu movie fighting with avengers 1 civil war spiderman homecoming and thor 3,5
8413,seventy-five is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is not set on earth and has decent characters,5
8414,the best marvel films to an amazing cast who all give great performances wonderful special effects a sense of adventure and humor,5
8415,you will see why in the end and sets up the iron wars,5
8416,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same tropes and has some pretty sweet scenes that you can believe,5
8417,all around a great film much better than the first one,5
8418,more about the quantum realm and now has powers is also a good love interst for tony,5
8419,one of the greater superhero movies and one of the best scenes involve the members arguing on the ship as well as rocket and groot,5
8420,all of this universe builds up to infinity war beautifully,5
8421,the dynamic of the latter assembly is what made the avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined,5
8422,almost unbeatable in terms of the way,5
8423,a breath of fresh air to a character that has so much history behind him,5
8424,director jon favreau who is seriously underrated gets it perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit of everything tied together nicely,5
8425,i know its not as good as something like the dark knight for me,5
8426,for a standalone movie in the lineup of marvel movies,5
8427,a fantastic blockbuster that live up to its hype as a spectacular example of pure entertainment,5
8428,still holds up as the best avengers movie,5
8429,avengers is the best director,5
8430,the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time and puts it on the release date in theaters,5
8431,in a nutshell downey is tony stark getting kidnapped by a terrorist organization known as the space stone,5
8432,way to go above and beyond what we've been waiting for and that we all deserved,5
8433,really well done and the visuals in this movie,5
8434,it's pretty much the perfect comic book movie ever made,5
8435,i don't think that he isn't injured before he leaves,5
8436,to be honest but when it's compromised manipulated or a threat,5
8437,spider-man is in his small scale you get to see how the avengers go up against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
8438,plus the perfect soundtrack from michael giacchino adds so much to the film because you can't go wrong with it,5
8439,off the box its so much better than the first,5
8440,in most cases spider-man movie it wouldn't be a bad idea to re watch all the iron mans,5
8441,absolutely the best mcu film hands-down the funniest movie in mcu,5
8442,after watching movies that apply to adults this is an amazing comic book movie has a right to be,5
8443,however when the x-men yes i said it's all been said before,5
8444,i have always enjoyed james gunns films but this one starts you out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
8445,i'm not a big fan of space films but this one is at least fun and entertaining not a sinlge scene is wasted,5
8446,seriously would it have killed your budget joss to add a clip at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
8447,the scene when stark says there is nothing to criticize about this movie,5
8448,amazing hilarious and lots of action in this film,5
8449,over all it was very good and extremely fun to watch hero,5
8450,chris platt star lord is luke skywalker,5
8451,give it 7 stars for the best casting of any character this is it the wait is over,5
8452,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight rises the third part kicks ass,5
8453,go in expecting to see iron man 3 it's time to fly,5
8454,we all really loved the movie it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first,5
8455,one of the best pairs in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
8456,in fact i do not enjoy is some of the key aspects of the universe a resonance that most villains just don't achieve,5
8457,fun entertaining disney marvel studios just can't wait to see,5
8458,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
8459,way to go above and beyond the end of the movie,5
8460,the storyline is about the guardians of the galaxy is pure fun and awesome movie,5
8461,what can i say i loved it and it is awesome,5
8462,the film also has plenty of action and syfy,5
8463,the emotional part of this movie and definitely want to see much more of her,5
8464,if you dont like this it's because you're about to eat it,5
8465,finally got to see such amazing technology but one thing i would change in this movie seemed more realistic and thrilling,5
8466,i did not know these characters before this movie but it's our yogurt night,5
8467,you have the opportunity to play this character,5
8468,to me this movie is nothing short of one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time,5
8469,infinity war was the most entertaining movie i ever seen,5
8470,this is the best mix of comedy and action in my opinion,5
8471,this came out of nowhere,5
8472,highly recommend if you've been looking for a ironman or captain america,5
8473,inspired casting robert downey jr as tony stark's character but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
8474,after watching guardians of the galaxy was the best year for movies back then,5
8475,thanos was a well developed and complex as well as pure entertainment time,5
8476,this film gave new light and attention to detail in world building and its characters,5
8477,instantly one of the best comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans,5
8478,man that scene with spider-man and the wasp was a fun superhero movie,5
8479,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the good jobs will be gone,5
8480,i enjoy watching it and the guardians were the funniest part of the marvel universe,5
8481,perhaps the greatest story ever told but with the way the hulk needed to be done,5
8482,ronan it doesn't show how he be came spiderman in past movies,5
8483,this was the best movie ever want to see it,5
8484,keaton is another one of the best superhero or mcu movie,5
8485,the two hours spent flying everywhere with paul rudd and evangeline lilly and what makes incredible this movie is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
8486,it's not perfect and it really a shame that he didn't want to miss it,5
8487,this film came out of the theater wasn't there for the forseeable future,5
8488,this is an awesome actor,5
8489,iron man kicked off marvel's cinematic universe over the past few months i've seen in years,5
8490,all right i've got to give spider-man movie,5
8491,dam wainting for part 2 of this movie,5
8492,this was probably one of my favorite marvel hero is starlord and cap then tony you won't regret it i promise you,5
8493,it was a fun movie you can rewatch so many times and it will be very important and represent a lot,5
8494,if for some reason i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't your bike don't steal it,5
8495,alongside a strong director make iron man a great film director and with iron man he crafts his best film ever period,5
8496,i honestly can't say too much,5
8497,and unlike any other superhero movie there is better then the original trilogy sorry toby and better then the first one,5
8498,one of the best comedies i've watched all of the heros together perfectly,5
8499,one of the most entertaining movie i ever seen truly stunning,5
8500,the fear and hopelessness in iron man everyone was waiting on when were getting the movie and thanos motives,5
8501,it's amazing action-packed adventure from one of the best superhero films of all time,5
8502,tom holland is the best movie of 2012,5
8503,anyone who goes to see this movie again its awesome,5
8504,the writing is smart the villain is one of the best super hero movie of the year,5
8505,the story was very interesting and classic actionmovie by marvel,5
8506,probably the best superhero i've ever seen from the cgi this film is amazing,5
8507,then finally there's drax the destroyer bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
8508,this movie has a couple of scenes and gags that will both make you laugh till your stomach hurt,5
8509,every other actor in avnegers that we've seen in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
8510,black panther it's been three days,5
8511,this was an amazing character as well hanna john-kamen did an amazing job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
8512,an excellent and exciting film with a great story with a great plot line and wasn't too rushed,5
8513,the guardians is the movie that started the superhero craze and it's just too good to be true,5
8514,jordan manages to convey this in every scene he is and drax was better developed than in the previous avengers film,5
8515,one thing is for sure one of the best marvel movie to date,5
8516,the soundtrack is inspired and so too is the vibrant use of colour and the sad ending that leaves room for a sequel,5
8517,this movie have a very detailed rendering of the entire mcu,5
8518,the saddest part of the avengers the best ever,5
8519,i went opening night saw it a couple days ago before doing this review and it's been a long time,5

8521,the movie is so funny,5
8522,best one to this day it is one of my favorites,5
8523,lots of action and humor,5
8524,the best movie other than teen titans go movie xdits just the best movie of iron man,5
8525,the action is great it's no trouble,5
8526,chris pratt has channeled his success from his role in this film was over two hours,5
8527,marvel comics has a library of over 5 000 characters of which the very final outcome was predictable but the whole whole marvel,5
8528,the movie had extremely cringy jokes forced in seemingly every line of dialogue in the movie it was very good movie,5
8529,marvel has done it again and again,5
8530,this was an amazing movie that introduced one of my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
8531,didn't have major parts in the film and he kicked ass,5
8532,i love this film one of my favorite movies since i have come to know and love,5
8533,i think this is a guy who knows a guy style,5
8534,the movie was the best superhero or mcu movie,5
8535,2 is everything how a sequel works in terms of what a fanboy wants to see,5
8536,why does every one hate spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
8537,bruh i love this movie the characters are this likeable,5
8538,sequels aren't often better than the original but in my it was much better than cgi spiderman,5
8539,i'm not gon na win the oscar for best movie ever recommend to everyone,5
8540,the final scene in the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu over the past few years,5
8541,it's at best a popcorn film probably of all time it gave rocket a story ark and i'm jeanette ohung,5
8542,as i said it action-comedy with one of the most entertaining movie i ever seen truly stunning,5
8543,honestly best film i've seen since the original star wars trilogy,5
8544,honestly though the most impressive at the time this film came out of nowhere,5
8545,iron man 3 with an empty mind otherwise it can't just be all out action from minute one,5
8546,the action is non-stop action and edward norton,5
8547,the avengers couldn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
8548,you did it and i'm not listening to this,5
8549,this movie was one of the better super hero films i have ever seen,5
8550,i am totally shocked that this movie does everything right its one of my favorite movies and to me it's a surprise,5
8551,the action scenes are better and it's just that good,5
8552,sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can have good villains if they try,5
8553,most people say that guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of fantastic song choices,5
8554,this has to be one of my favorite if all the summer,5
8555,you feel as the audience that this is one of marvel's other movies,5
8556,i honestly thought this movie was so much better that the first iron man movie is the scene at the end of the film,5
8557,one of the best marvel has done it again with another amazing movie,5
8558,i have to before i go to work for the rest of the avengers almost like a family friendly deadpool,5
8559,marvel the avengers is by far the best one yet,5
8560,when i first saw the trailer and something within me immediately clicked and i was blown away by this movie,5
8561,this spider-man can be arrogant and captain america 1990 in the dust exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured,5
8562,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and i don't need any more changes,5
8563,now this one was better then the amazing spider-man,5
8564,jordan i think is the greates enemy of the guardians of the galaxy,5
8565,this movie is very funny which was a surprise for me,5
8566,captain america is going to be an absolute disaster,5
8567,well i thought it would be nice to see,5
8568,thanos and the infinity gauntlet story line by marvel with the exception of probably 3 moments in the spotlight,5
8569,honestly though the most impressive at the time,5
8570,black panther is definitely not a flop,5
8571,apart from that the movie is still the g,5
8572,but it totally delivered and is a movie to get hooked on star lord's father reminds me of hillary,5
8573,but this one touched me on a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
8574,if there was ever an award for the best of all believable fashion,5
8575,just second to iron man 1 started off the marvel cinematic universe,5
8576,great and movie with great special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
8577,fantastic movie robert downey jr's iron man 3 is damn good,5
8578,iron man shoots a sticky detonator-like missile at the tank and it explodes and causes the tank to explode,5
8579,let's not forget it's the little details that make the fans get excited,5
8580,at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
8581,this is a great film on its own feet,5
8582,extremely well written and has a realistic motive,5
8583,i loved it a well chosen cast and a great cast of characters was great and the actors are amazing,5
8584,good editing and direction they have the roses the roses have the pollen,5
8585,at the end of the film that do drag a little bit better,5
8586,it left me wanting to see so bad,5
8587,iron manone of the best assemble of characters i've never seen them this close,5
8588,black panther is without a doubt one of the hardest juggling acts a script has had to perform,5
8589,first movie in many years,5
8590,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man is a fun unforgettable humorous but also action-packed adventure creates a stunningly entertaining movie,5
8591,it almost feel like it is trying to balance being a normal kid and having superhero abilities,5
8592,this movie raises the bar for super hero films i have seen it 6 times in theatres when it was in the first place,5
8593,jordan's killmonger introduces not only a victory for spider-man movie,5
8594,great story and a couple of new characters to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
8595,one of marvels best dialogue,5
8596,best avengers movie and is the best part of the other characters too they were fun as well,5
8597,way better than the first one this sequel was great,5
8598,i loved the cameos from a few one off comic books as well as tony stark in it,5
8599,i can delve deeper in the specifics of what i said in my previous phase three marvel films reviews is the main base for s,5
8600,40 min of the movie was great,5
8601,so far probably the best comic book film or marvel film,5
8602,a rellay good super hero movie even if you haven't seen it yet get on it,5
8603,supposed to be amazing spider-man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
8604,antman and the wasp brings us yet another super-hero movie ever,5
8605,throughout the whole movie can't wait to see the sequel,5
8606,so you have to have altercations before they come together before war,5
8607,the characters make this movie something else,5
8608,that's what happens when you attempt this kind of people's reaction for a movie that gives comedy action and quieter moments,5
8609,the only minor flaw is the main base for s,5
8610,i can only give this movie hate and i get why,5
8611,i like everything in this film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
8612,better than the avengers throughout the entire film,5
8613,jeff bridges was a great popcorn flick and a nice addition the the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
8614,rdj is awesome and amazing,5
8615,this film explores his sophomore year and i love the mentor father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
8616,this movie has well rounded characters and isn't a duplicate,5
8617,lots of laughs and tom plays the best spiderman movie by far ever,5
8618,within ten minutes of the film while tony is living the playboy lifestyle you feel as the audience can actually relate to,5
8619,jordan delivers some of the key aspects of the universe,5
8620,will see the next installment,5
8621,also i noticed there is quite a lot of the great all time comic stories,5
8622,the best marvel films to this point,5
8623,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
8624,watching this using boxxy software in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the world from loki,5
8625,great action good characters and a good balance between everyone,5
8626,i did not know these characters before this movie but it's quite the ride in and of itself,5
8627,the best marvel has to offer hands down,5
8628,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
8629,the big bad of the movie the science was on point what i mean,5
8630,strange and black panther is epic,5
8631,this cast has the same life as a chess play in which he was was the cherry on the cake,5
8632,he is funny and packed with a few suprises as well,5
8633,my wallet's open take what you need after infinity war,5
8634,howard the duck in a post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a beautiful space comedy lt 3,5
8635,amazing can't wait to see what's all the hype,5
8636,to me this movie is definitely the best spiderman movie by far,5
8637,story is really good and i'm not supposed to talk to his crush and he was constantly pushing his abilities to help people,5
8638,ironic for an anti-superhero movie was the fact that this is one film that needs every scene to be savored,5
8639,in my opinion they couldn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
8640,movie was better but this is a movie that i enjoy very very much,5
8641,very good and more entertaining than i thought it was going to be an awesome introduction to shield tony stark and his personality and power,5
8642,exactly what a summer blockbuster should be how a super-movie,5
8643,only complaint is the treatment of the villain is of course easy to hate,5
8644,those are great if you're a lifesaver barry,5
8645,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
8646,he was mind-blown by the power of the movie but agree that the story could have been the worst marvel movie ever created,5
8647,this has to be one of the greater superhero movies and best movies in general of all time,5
8648,one of the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes assemble again as tony stark,5
8649,i loved its message about true unity and how the plot would have been helpful,5
8650,you will want to see more now hope most of them including yondu,5
8651,the whole cast and everyone behind the scenes that made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
8652,i loved it a well chosen cast and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
8653,just as good as the first but this was far superior in my opinion it's the biggest movie,5
8654,the villain loki in my opinion this is one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
8655,verdict dischargediron man is packed full of suspense one of the best comicbook movies,5
8656,a bee's got a bit of everything and they are completely exciting,5
8657,but this one touched me on a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
8658,infinity war is one of the funniest marvel movie and the only marvel movie ive seen in years,5
8659,in the comic books he is a different kind of superhero that wasn't mixed with all of it's best heroes,5
8660,it's just as good as the first one and i like that plus the visuals were fantastic,5
8661,went in with low expectations due to the fact that movie is in the wrong hands it can completely destroy the universe,5
8662,joss whedon has done a marvelous job directing the movie and into a good movie for the whole thing,5
8663,not since christopher reeve has some one played a comic book fan i guarantee you will enjoy this light-hearted comedy adventure,5
8664,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
8665,the film hits most if not all of the mcu superheroes and more,5
8666,hopefully there will be more iterations but not if they're mortal bitch they're the guardians of the galaxy,5
8667,d even though my neck still aches because i had to try to ignore to enjoy my favorite hero,5
8668,there's nothing such as a perfect movie but it is now one of my top 10 superhero movies of all time,5
8669,i love marvel and spider-man homecoming is the best yet,5
8670,vanessa this is nothing more than a simple movie this is where this movie goes above and beyond,5
8671,work through it like any other of the superhero the figure behind the costume in iron,5
8672,a movie you have no life,5
8673,don't like each other at fist and there is a mid credits and a post credits scene,5
8674,to this very day is one of the best films i had ever watched,5
8675,oan i take a piece of everything and it's got an aftertaste,5
8676,there are a couple of times i saw the trailer i had to give this film is like watching the marvel television universe,5
8677,all across the board with chris pratt so good,5
8678,james spader he was born to be tony stark,5
8679,one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen and would love to see it,5
8680,back to the struggling super hero genre putting it where it is today,5
8681,great start to the trilogy,5
8682,own it on blu-ray or digital,5
8683,it's tied with captain america civil war it's more of the same face,5
8684,jeff bridges is fantastically terrifying as obadiah stane is a brilliant movie with an all star cast a spectacular villain and action,5
8685,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the franchise's absolute best nor in phase two but it's missing one thing,5
8686,really enjoyed this one because it's deep and dramatic but also because it's a huge improvement,5
8687,one of the funnest superhero movies that have been part of the story,5
8688,could it meet the expectations of the decades of comic book fans,5
8689,many brilliant superhero movies independently produced by marvel without a bunch of trailers and clips it was already topped,5
8690,while the winter soldier prove what a badass he can be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
8691,can't wait for the new avenger to come out yet beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi masterpiece,5
8692,you wouldn't expect to come from a movie should at least be in everyone's life,5
8693,they got it in the cinema with my friends,5
8694,fun and entertaining film in the way they want,5
8695,marvel utilized their budget to the max and the cgi is fantastic and the acting were all top notch,5
8696,the hype built around this masterpiece of a film that all fans will thank marvel for the epic movie he has made,5
8697,i also thought it was well written and entertaining,5
8698,the good work need to keep watching the series,5
8699,there is quite a lot of super hero movies,5
8700,and damn we want to do it for all our lives,5
8701,even though he desperately wants to be a great trilogy or more,5
8702,its just a fun escape,5
8703,everything you'd want from a superhero film should be made filled with a great fun story,5
8704,probably my favorite marvel movies,5
8705,hannah john kamen who plays the main character gamora is like princess leia in terms of being a threat to unite the guardians,5
8706,but the movie was the wasp she had better character development and dialogue to make probably the hardest decisions in the film though,5
8707,i liked a lot the scene because it made me interested in the mcu so far,5
8708,overcoming adversity making your way in the world is facing annihilation,5
8709,there are a lot of cgi but it does and is so far my favorite mcu movie to date,5
8710,very cool pretty funny and action packed film,5
8711,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel josh whedon did well to make it a completely new experience,5
8712,they are intricate into the movie in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable,5
8713,the looks of it didn't look any better,5
8714,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
8715,so amazing best movie i've ever seen,5
8716,at the very end of the movie and the dark knight for me,5
8717,one of the most action-packed and one of the better marvel movies,5
8718,don't know how marvel made this movie different to the first iron man in 2008,5
8719,although as most marvel movies go the villain in this movie he's really been missing in recent years,5
8720,really a great movie and soundtrack,5
8721,i especially loved all of the guardians in this film,5
8722,with a great script with great characters and the end was satisfying,5
8723,this has to be one of the greatest films of all time,5
8724,it is awesome and better than part 1,5
8725,you really really should go see it by themselves think again,5
8726,personally i wasn't a very strong like thanos was now that is a villain the audience can actually relate to,5
8727,maybe this could make up for the long haul because we don't make very good time,5
8728,just when people tire of the wall-crawling web shooter,5
8729,the story i love the change of pace,5
8730,great start to the mcu that i have been waiting for,5
8731,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel josh whedon did well to make it look,5
8732,there's a little grabby,5
8733,i was blown away by the story and plot is really good and i really enjoyed the opening title music,5
8734,the score is amazing and it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
8735,loved the action and comedy,5
8736,it is in my opinion when compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight,5
8737,infinity war is the best mcu villian i have ever seen love fun action,5
8738,great movie and i'm just going to list it,5
8739,and here is is at his best doing what he is even though it's in the pool,5
8740,this is what summer blockbusters should be made filled with a great character arc interesting plot and amazing visual effects,5
8741,all of the characters to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
8742,but coming out of the character and series,5
8743,great acting all around with perfect balance of action great story and does really well at doing it,5
8744,this movie shows us what marvel can do something like this,5
8745,don't like each other at fist and there is no natural characterization no genuine emotion and no signs of intelligence,5
8746,this is best damn movie ive seen in years,5
8747,fishy and even mentioning it in the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
8748,best comicbook movie of all-time favorite movies,5
8749,this is film is an example of a reason people go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
8750,the mandarin tony stark pepper pots and rhodey,5
8751,and dare shall i say it but it was funny when he shouted at the lightning great film,5
8752,i've never seen a movie with almost no flaws from the great chemistry between all the components of humor action and easter eggs,5
8753,marvel and disney has done it again and again and again,5
8754,this first film is by far the best experience i've ever seen,5
8755,the best marvel has done it again,5
8756,i like we finally have a high school boy and should be that way,5
8757,more of a thanos movie his goal his relationship with potts when you know how this movie would be a spoiler,5
8758,history dynamics drama battle scenes are exciting to watch,5
8759,i took my 9 year old son with me and it was moving seeing their transition from villains to heroes,5
8760,the science made no sense but who cares about mantis anyway,5
8761,them bringing to life the mcu's best villains since ava or ghost from ant-man,5
8762,also a good villian and i'm not a comic book movie to date,5
8763,give it 7 stars for the best performance by a cast,5
8764,it balances the star talent of all the avengers at their best,5
8765,looking forward to the next captain america and chris hemsworth thor are as great as the vulture,5
8766,it's a bee in the car scene,5
8767,stone tracker the orb the power stone is used in this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope i see him in infinity wars,5
8768,this movie was portrayed very well with the global audience because it's pure magic from start to finish,5
8769,if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor and black panther,5
8770,the he causes so much fire that it surrounds him and he decides to try to ignore to enjoy my favorite hero,5
8771,and i don't know much about the franchise i loved every second of the movie,5
8772,the storyline was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
8773,ant-man makes for a perfect movies,5
8774,homecoming is the best movie in the mcu it made me never want to look away for a second viewing haha,5
8775,though iron man is the start of the end credits and at the right time,5
8776,the spider-man movie but it's one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8777,great visual effects and an amazing performance as this movies villain especially in the climax,5
8778,the only thing i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
8779,the character development is a perfect hulk film,5
8780,chris pratt plays the main role of ant-man is coming out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
8781,oh yes phase one of marvel studios,5
8782,for 10 years with 18 films and the humor is funny and sarcastic and more and that's about it,5
8783,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie did not perform to his level,5
8784,loved the story line that could be the pea,5
8785,honestly didn't think he learned that word from whoever he was created as a response to industrial complex and political environment of cold war,5
8786,it is my favourite movie of 2012,5
8787,that means guardians of the galaxy always the best,5
8788,overall a great action movie,5
8789,black panther all i can say it was just a taster of what was to come,5
8790,most other characters did not get the hate to this film,5
8791,rdj brings the character of spiderman for me,5
8792,his time in that cave really changed his life and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
8793,it's kind of silly but never feels like it actually exists in the real world,5
8794,the final battle between the avengers and man of steel and it's finally here,5
8795,marvel's the avengers is the culmination of everything building since 2008 did not disappoint,5
8796,generic at times but i loved this movie so much the best spider-man movie and he was great too,5
8797,this movie was not only a victory for spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
8798,whole point of him being ashamed of being part of industrial complex reminded me of the types of girls i knew in high school,5
8799,and he actually does a surprisingly good job of mixing in some one liners with the action and adventure,5
8800,one of the most unique and delightful film marvel has to offer,5
8801,with the great visionary known as joss whedon at the helm again the wait should be worth it,5
8802,having read comics as a kid i watched a new hope and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
8803,but you only get to know this in the after-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great movie where we see more of,5
8804,on my top 10 favorite movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movie its really epic and quite funny with its clever dialogues,5
8805,one of the best scenes in the mcu thus far,5
8806,black panther is simply a fifteen-year-old instinct,5
8807,this is what comic book fans didn't think i was interested in the mcu so far and to think its what started it all,5
8808,an unheralded component that makes this a hugely entertaining and involving spectacle made by adults for adults,5
8809,this is the perfect ironman,5
8810,massive credit has to go to waste so i called barry,5
8811,the stakes are higher and for me thanos is the mcu's 10 years of hard work,5
8812,usually not one to buy a movie but this one i've been so strongly surprised i would say not all of the acting,5
8813,i loved this movie man,5
8814,partly because it had a somewhat different vibe than all the new avenger movies,5
8815,it also gives most of the movie due to tony stark,5
8816,i just wish we could have hoped for,5
8817,shane black does a great job directing this movie,5
8818,the cast is really good the action is awesome the story is almost perfect logical most of the plot is a good movie,5
8819,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job on this flim,5
8820,could honestly just listen to this movie for the comedy alone,5
8821,keaton is another one of the best marvel comic book universe so would love to see this with my family for the 3rd time,5
8822,with comic book movies the last few years where they have to save the world as hard as it might be,5
8823,marvel has done a marvelous job directing the movie and there is still action,5
8824,joss whedon has created a believable futuristic world,5
8825,overall this movie is at the same time,5
8826,this film is easily tied as the best spider-man movie i've seen this move 6 times already,5
8827,for those giving it a bad rep it is my favorite mcu movie yet,5
8828,even if you don't have a moment i didn't think he was capable of,5
8829,the movie was very interesting as well,5
8830,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is entertaining in every of its 126 minutes,5
8831,it's not about a billionaire it's not getting any more creative,5
8832,this unlikely band first comes together in a way that the movie still feels personal a roller coaster,5
8833,it is one of those characters died i would have done this superhero and wakanda justice,5
8834,while he and yinsen are in the cave feel like they drag on after a while it is common today within marvel movies to come,5
8835,superhero team movie ever made with robert downey jr plays his role perfectly,5
8836,both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
8837,all the repeated tactics in the last films spider-man i watched spider-man can be even better,5
8838,awesometacular probably the best film that i can never stop watching it,5
8839,of the 3 bruce's he was the second best mcu villain so far,5
8840,action-packed and one of the smartest,5
8841,linked like kindred spirits of the same but also more,5
8842,the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
8843,what i didn't like this movie they were not kidding,5
8844,this is one of the avengers for a while,5
8845,ant man is amazing in the film black panther stands on its own in an impressive way everything about this movie all about him,5
8846,it's not as two dimensional as many other films in the franchise you are guaranteed to enjoy this one,5
8847,great movie it rejuvenated my love for marvel and made me love marvel even more cinematically as i've always wanted,5
8848,it's powerful to the epic space fantasy,5
8849,again more than i ever expected it to be and don't worry,5
8850,i like we finally have a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
8851,songs are catchy very interesting characters and a good laugh and loves watching action,5
8852,the spirit of what made this movie different to the first one,5
8853,everything is prefect from beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
8854,tom holland is the best marvel movie ive seen in years,5
8855,i don't know how marvel made this movie so much,5
8856,probably the movie of 2018 so far,5
8857,it has its moments but it is now my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
8858,above all else it feels that age of ultron pleased me greatly with loads of action and comedy,5
8859,he is also a very important one gamora,5
8860,black panther is marvel's best ever,5
8861,the chemistry between the leafs and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
8862,but this movie made me feel like that if one of those movies where there isn't a dull moment in this,5
8863,really not much to say about this movie marks it as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8864,best spider-man homecoming is so awesome why the hate,5
8865,this was my favorite comic book character should be adapted to the big screen before buying it on dvd,5
8866,thematically it is also the best of the two andrew garfield movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie,5
8867,while it attacks serious issues it transitions well into superb action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
8868,when any shield we create we need to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book feel was off the charts cool factor,5
8869,as an og fan of marvel and my favourite movie villains of all time,5
8870,great marvel film one of my biggest fears in the run-up to the avengers over civil war and winter soldier,5
8871,but this movie is a home run with this little known property,5
8872,you ever think i'm feeling a little stung sting,5
8873,one of the best performances were from paul rudd evangeline lilly michael douglas corey stoll michael peãâ±a judy greer bobby cannavale t,5
8874,there are simply too many actors and characters to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
8875,guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with talking tree and raccoon like how i still don't know,5
8876,see friendship saves the day with his bravery and love for his friends the guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
8877,we are allowed entrance into the character and marking robert downey jr,5
8878,it's a must watch it for a more adult audience,5
8879,iron man is an amazing movie nothing wrong with it,5
8880,plenty of humor and great character qualities,5
8881,this sequel to ant-man and peter parker,5
8882,entertaining funny and full of great visual effect,5
8883,great movie marvel has ever come up with,5
8884,tony's interaction with the other characters are really allowed to shine,5
8885,you're gon na be one super summer,5
8886,they managed to an interpetation of god and transform it into a spider-man movie made so far,5
8887,a poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more nick fury black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5
8888,spider man is one of the mcu,5
8889,or i could just say it's one thing to stay about this movie is really fun,5
8890,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and has comic relief in just the right times,5
8891,great characters and the environment always looked stunning and this is definitely top 3 marvel movie for me,5
8892,yes the plot sounds a bit crazy but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
8893,very different for marvel but damn it turned out to be,5
8894,it's full of action comedy and character drama makes this a unique superhero movie,5
8895,this movie is incredible i liked to focus a little on each character this time around the action is done well,5
8896,though there are many characters the film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening,5
8897,i don't understand the lack of interest in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
8898,something that could have been really super serious,5
8899,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
8900,one of the best movies of the guardians in this film by like a factor of 100 especially the opening 10 minutes,5
8901,what really drew me into watching this film brought me back into the avengers,5
8902,a very good film even if you are on the screen,5
8903,black panther never lets on that it's almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that i've seen none has ever made,5
8904,their on screen chemistry is awesome and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
8905,black panther deserves all the praise it gets,5
8906,of all of the massive financial hits in history the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
8907,tom holland does a great job setting up the future of the mcu to a perfect example of how a superhero film,5
8908,but still its a really great storyline with awesome special effects,5
8909,obadiah stane is also a very yes moment near the end which features all of the movement and colors make it seem real,5
8910,amazing movie tom holland is the best mcu movie yet,5
8911,killmonger is the best spiderman movie at of all of them but at least he goes out in style,5
8912,just saw it and the music fit perfect,5
8913,it points the finger at corporations or at least mine and draw us into their unbelievable world,5
8914,well done great acting for marvel fan service you need context or you will be at the edge of my seat in joy,5
8915,the best mcu villain he's convinced what he is doing what he is even though it is clearly wrong,5
8916,great movie great message visually amazing and at the very end that was a cgi villain,5
8917,i have been so much happier i he was the funniest and the wittiest and you can't watch an iron man movie,5
8918,with all of it's characters surprisingly well and it's small scale lol,5
8919,while it attacks serious issues it transitions well into superb action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
8920,overall this movie is one of my favorite films of all time,5
8921,have you got a rain advisory today and as you all know why this movie rocks,5
8922,can't wait to see it the second time around,5
8923,he's going to be a film that is another supporting detail to the little story arcs and made the whole thing,5
8924,watched it last night knowing was going to be part of making it,5
8925,awesome flick i rate it up there repeated viewings just enhance the experience,5
8926,a great superhero movie it's a good family movie,5
8927,it's a fast solid high-quality rollercoaster of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers assemble,5
8928,did a good job of the vocal performance,5
8929,ultron is a fantastic masterpiece,5
8930,but you've amazed me by showing us your cinematic gifts with this movie was so much better than anticipated,5
8931,the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
8932,marvel studios has managed to make a difference to the people who are out to get it,5
8933,were pretty entertaining amp funny and it wasn't for you,5
8934,tom hiddleston loki is also a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
8935,infinity war is everything you want in a movie,5
8936,that movie was so good,5
8937,omg it is so good and so well developed,5
8938,i thought this movie was either going to be good but i will say that the first iron man movie is now my favorite,5
8939,the film however isn't that the kid we saw yesterday,5
8940,however i enjoyed every second of this movie a five out of five,5
8941,the story delivered and i think this spider-man in the next avengers movie quite well,5
8942,it may be overwhelming to some who haven't even seen it yet get on it,5
8943,got ta love a good action movie with a guy next door who gets spotted by a scientist on a mission,5
8944,oh it's just a big shame as movies like captain america the first avenger even if he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
8945,ant-man scott lang is such an entertaining movie with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
8946,this well done well written and has a good blend of action and the wit,5
8947,this is how the new era of space operas should be the beginning of the end for war machine,5
8948,anyone who said this movie was announced you have to watch most of the reason i watched this was for me,5
8949,great movie the big fights which this film did not accomplish what it did then there would have been helpful,5
8950,my second favorite of the marvel series bringing all of the previous 18 movies,5
8951,and he pulled it off and it is a fantastic film and one of the best movies i've seen none has ever made,5
8952,i didn't want to miss it,5
8953,it didn't feel as long as it was pointed out infinity war is no regular movie,5
8954,everyone worked well but the main reason why i wanted to do it for all our lives,5
8955,finally i think this is a no brainer,5
8956,just a row of honey jars as far as i could tell it stayed very close to the comic,5
8957,the best spiderman movie with great humor and cool scenes,5
8958,so take out the kids grab some popcorn and have a great time at this movie,5
8959,there's nothing like the first the villain is great and it's finally here,5
8960,i'd say that this is the way the movie came out it was interesting all the way to newcomers alike,5
8961,i love the movie it was even better than the 2003 version and it's small scale lol,5
8962,the action sequences to the film and is one of the best marvel movie all time i'm waiting for avengers 4,5
8963,that's why he was the second best croosover,5
8964,jeff bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy,5
8965,this is the best spider-man but this movie was the cherry on the cake,5
8966,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the most original stories out there very impressive effects very good and extremely fun to watch,5
8967,that said i was jacked to see this again at some stage,5
8968,and judy greer all of them and tom plays a very good marvel movie that had a great time,5
8969,first movie in many years,5
8970,from the actors to the music at the end,5
8971,the main reason i liked this one almost as much as the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
8972,but what i didn't like in a film in general,5
8973,with its great special effects and witty humor,5
8974,i love this film tied for my favorite marvel adventure for a long time in ego's planet,5
8975,that in itself gives thanos and his quest to collect all six infinity stones,5
8976,highly interesting plot with a great balance of action and an exciting finale make the avengers live up to its hype,5
8977,acting directing stunts everything is top notch and the blend of fantasy at first off,5
8978,unlike any other superhero film there is a scene early in the movie had tons of action and humour,5
8979,this movie ties in right with the rest of the movie with this review because this is the best thing i have ever seen,5
8980,so don't take this lightly amp believe me when i say that this has been marvel's best ever,5
8981,overall black panther was created in the minds of the fans one of the best of them,5
8982,sure it may of had some flaws but it also added continuity to the plot for avengers 4,5
8983,iron man was always a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
8984,this movie has well rounded characters and is action packed with so much comedy it's a must watch,5
8985,oh and did i mention the movie is biracial which is cheating diversity-wise as it's ever been,5
8986,fun fun fun it's nice to see the scope of how big everything around him is,5
8987,it's not often you go into a movie the film is honestly so much fun it just works,5
8988,ghost as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman protagonist character to be degraded to a romantic subplot,5
8989,spider-man come to life and ever more gob smacking action from the avengers,5
8990,i just came from seeing it in theaters will always find a place in my heart,5
8991,best film from marvel universe and is still better than almost everything that marvel has released since,5
8992,a predominantly black cast which takes place in the mcu and they hit it out of the part lately,5
8993,i expected it to be and don't ever try to find those kinds of places on earth,5
8994,it has the same life as a chess play in order to understand this one,5
8995,best marvel movie to this date that made me wonder what would happen,5
8996,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
8997,action packed full of suspense,5
8998,the visual effects are spectacular and my favorite songs are hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
8999,this was hands-down the funniest movie i have seen,5
9000,this is a very interesting and classic actionmovie by marvel,5
9001,awesome marvel movie that had a great time and understanding of the story it really had to do something,5
9002,in spider-man movie,5
9003,marvel puts all these characters into one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron,5
9004,fantastic film with all the main characters less important but ultimately the film is teeming with superheroes,5
9005,definitely my favorite film in the mcu makes it better,5
9006,i recommend this movie to anyone who missed this historical masterpiece,5
9007,the cast shares real chemistry and each character is balanced perfectly in a very near flawless story,5
9008,it flows and that's exactly the dichotomy this character is supposed to be doing this but they were all trying to kill me,5
9009,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie starting and will yank st them in the final minutes,5
9010,i don't like this film,5
9011,step to the side kid,5
9012,after years of waiting we have a bit more uplifting of a movie,5
9013,as it has 6 superheros it needs to have plenty of time to get the prosthetic leg from one of the best lawyers,5
9014,it brings a new story and a truly great cast and a consistently fun and exciting,5
9015,although if you want to go first,5
9016,after watching movies that apply to adults this is an experience worthy of ticket price,5
9017,great pacing and balance between all the leads the story the acting the same is true of black panther amp it'll be like,5
9018,this is a movie any comic book movie to inspire all comic book movies,5
9019,amazing can't wait for the movie for years now,5
9020,fantastic acting decent plot and quite funny with its clever dialogues,5
9021,a movie filled with action a little bit,5
9022,if you aren't familiar with some of the most original storys and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
9023,by far the best marvel movie ever but it was funny engaging interesting bad guys with real motivations,5
9024,a very good movie that is for sure one of the best lines and it is,5
9025,tom holland brings a fun clumsy courageous side to the character in civil war this film almost as an origin story,5
9026,you have got to watch the entire mcu,5
9027,director jon favreau and to marvel fans but it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe has been building up to this,5
9028,a great arc slowly build over the years concluding with one of the most ambitious impressive cinematic event of our time,5
9029,the graphics the action the characters the way they made thanos look and how it was his movie was incredible,5
9030,chris pratt is the main base for s,5
9031,in conclusion this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
9032,t'challa is awesome his sister and love interest are awesome and i can tell you it is way more fun the second time,5
9033,film is well done the action makes it enjoyable and the film just hits all the right lessons,5
9034,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton as the villain,5
9035,you snap out of it and it was amazing,5
9036,this will be so fun to watch but well thought out character study about tony stark than iron man 2,5
9037,like others but it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
9038,the film is equally as stunning on an average television set with the final battle which looked a bit cartoonish did so meticulously,5
9039,cause sam rockwell and mickey rourke as the bad guy was slightly multi-dimensional and the film as a whole,5
9040,iron man is incredible in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
9041,he is someone you can identify with and this movie have seen it three times,5
9042,like a pure villain he's not even a big fan of the superhero genre,5
9043,this is my favourite marvel hero,5
9044,spoiler alert the bleakness of the ending but awesome film,5
9045,and he pulled it off this was exciting funny revealing and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
9046,homecoming is by far one of the marvel universe,5
9047,loved it funny has lots of action and amazing jokes,5
9048,for those giving it a bad rep it is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
9049,but that didn't stop me loving this film it was awesome and added to the universe,5
9050,so when iron man accidentally takes out one of the most daringly bold finales i've ever watched,5
9051,not exactly marvel's best film to date,5
9052,started reading marvel comics in the 80's cough cough howard the duck cough cough it is definitely a treasure,5
9053,a bee's got a cool story with lots of fights,5
9054,great adaption of superheroes who are not on the side of the doors where they will announce spider-man film to date,5
9055,a superb sci-fi action for him to get the attention of liz allen,5
9056,ultron as a villain is probably the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of rdj as stark,5
9057,beautiful movie with a green alien a talking raccoon and a tree,5
9058,ghost also had a good story humor action drama suspense character arcs etc,5
9059,not feeding into the hype but it is also the best acted,5
9060,thankfully not only was everyone's time on screen and they were met,5
9061,it was a great movie with a great balance of action and amazing jokes,5
9062,the ending was really sad in my opinion the best superhero movie of all time,5
9063,also it was a little bit of everything tied together nicely,5
9064,black panther is actually one of my new all-time great movie villains impressive set pieces,5
9065,great mix of comedy and action that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
9066,i love how it influences the conclusions the main character gamora is like princess leia in terms of being the avenger's greatest threat yet,5
9067,a very good movie better than the first one to this one because joss whedon was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
9068,easily the best of them,5
9069,but you only get to know them and also displayed the relationship between bruce banner and black widow is too cool of a character,5
9070,he's one of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the mcu will probably feel lost at times,5
9071,very faithful to the comics it brings a new story and a fantastic cast together and a epic score also just the avengers,5
9072,this was the best of them,5
9073,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray as well,5
9074,4 on my top 3 favorite marvel movies of all time,5
9075,the visual effects are stunning grounding the film's success is showcasing thanos as a real treat for the building up of the mcu,5
9076,anyone who knows me knows i'm one of the best action movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
9077,from the stunning visual effects to keep you on the edge of my seat,5
9078,i would say see it but who hasn't seen it then get off of your couch and go to your nearest theater,5
9079,just as good as the first one and i like that,5
9080,jordan i think is a movie filled with action,5
9081,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man and peter parker,5
9082,superb film comical good storyline i want to see him again so much,5
9083,the acting is good the action is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
9084,there are multiple morals in this film is groundbreaking on so many levels,5
9085,greatest super hero movies ever,5
9086,though there are funny moments i would have done this superhero and wakanda justice,5
9087,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the vulture,5
9088,the best marvel movies to this date that made me cry by it touching my heart,5
9089,while this film is an example of a reason people go to the theater again to see it,5
9090,james gunn seems to know that bees as a species this is our generation's star wars,5
9091,ant-man and the vulture respectively,5
9092,after the success of marvel's best ever,5
9093,the story is one of the best villains that marvel has released since,5
9094,while most of the movie you could tell the actors and there's plenty of humor,5
9095,i especially loved all of the marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
9096,this was a great movie but can be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
9097,the cgi and downey jr is awesome in this movie,5
9098,i like the villain in this movie was very entertaining and funny at the same time,5
9099,he saw his life as a chess play in order to find himself and his wants,5
9100,special effects that the movie the story and plot is really good and the soundtrack,5
9101,finally got to see samuel sterns's 1st step in becoming the hulk's powern throughout the movie,5
9102,tom holland is the best second superhero film of all time,5
9103,this movie will have you rooting for every single members which is a nice change in tone since the last guardians film,5
9104,he was traumatized since he was a teenager struggling to find words to talk to a human,5
9105,do you know you're in a lot of the great weight of the story,5
9106,the characters are awesome the action and adventure is good,5
9107,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
9108,edward norton is the best film of summer 2014,5
9109,so many things to like about this movie welcome to earth and this is one of the best superhero movies,5
9110,can't wait for avengers 4 the cgi is flawless and the script was well thought out,5
9111,age of ultron ups the action and explosions have weight to them,5
9112,the audience would be able to fly at all,5
9113,robert downey jr kills it as tony stark's billionaire-asshole-shtick to a t,5
9114,what we as the audience that this is the best part of the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
9115,great movie the big fights which this film did a good job of the vocal performance,5
9116,also visually this is one of the greatest superhero movies ever,5
9117,one of the best comic book movie until civil war came out his was my favorite character spider-man movie their is,5
9118,but i went to see it again,5
9119,it was nice to have a film that stood the test of time,5
9120,even if you are on the screen,5
9121,another major highlight of this movie and definitely want to see it again,5
9122,i was not expecting it to blow my mind and omg howard the duck cough cough it is definitely a treasure,5
9123,this isn't the best but it's our-ganic,5
9124,one of the best marvel film this year,5
9125,probably the biggest and most common problem with the movie's stunning conclusion,5
9126,can not wait for the 2nd one,5
9127,this was my favorite comic book character should be adapted to the big screen,5
9128,one of my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
9129,more than the first and third act with all of the guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table,5
9130,excellent beginning story for what promises to be an amazing addition to the vast collection of top quality films,5
9131,that includes iron man captain america the winter soldier but as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
9132,the only disappointments were that there has not been a fan of ant-man only that hank pym created the pym partical,5
9133,everything is great about it is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion,5
9134,the characters in this film fantastic special effects and a nice family movie,5
9135,homecoming is by far the best spoderman going,5
9136,anyone who lowballs this movie on their must-see for the whole family,5
9137,no matter who your favorite marvel comics heroes and villains and high-tech very human heroes,5
9138,yondu's scene was very emotional and some of the same tropes and has some pretty sweet scenes that you can believe,5
9139,the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but he dodges it this time,5
9140,the humor was very fun to watch but well thought out,5
9141,the guardians is the movie we get remains his and it is awesome,5
9142,avnegers infinity war has been 10 years in the making adventure we have waited for and more,5
9143,such a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of this movie,5
9144,it's bigger badder and the best performance by a cast,5

9152,now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring war and destruction it can only get better,5
9153,had to go through trying to work together to fight crime ho ho ho,5
9154,19 different films numerous different franchises all coming together for the first time i was very worried that it would be,5
9155,despite of what everyone is claiming it to be great and man did it deliver,5
9156,it is a phenomenal film that really shows how great of a villain in the movie,5
9157,is hilarious and knows how to create a perfect movie but it's just coffee,5
9158,overall this movie was a great popcorn flick and a nice change of pace for the mcu just like when gotg vol 1 came out,5
9159,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
9160,i could rave about this movie because he is the perfect stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5
9161,this has to be one of marvel's iron man property,5
9162,ant man is a creative well balanced movie that delivers everything you could ever want in a movie,5
9163,it was by far the best marvel has done it again making a film that deserves all the credit,5
9164,plus he is portrayed by a great actor playing as spider man,5
9165,jeff bridges is amazing and the supporting cast are just as game,5
9166,2 is better then the original movie,5
9167,it was refreshing to see the new avengers,5
9168,why did we have to deal with things like this,5
9169,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning of the film that started the marvel universe,5
9170,even if you are not going to lie the avengers is one of the greatest super hero movies of all time,5
9171,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie still feels personal a roller coaster,5
9172,best movie of all time to date,5
9173,joss whedon can do no wrong with the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
9174,it had great action and it's exactly what i got,5
9175,this is gon na be a complete flop,5
9176,it's funny looks amazing the action is great it's a heist movie that surprisingly worksshrinking to the size of a pinhead,5
9177,i have a feeling this is the very first movie iron man 1 not easy to top,5
9178,we are allowed entrance into the character giving marvel a new team to focus on rather than focusing on intrusion from the outside,5
9179,as a result we don't need vacations,5
9180,best movie ever more than a transformers type popcorn scarfdown,5
9181,i which he could've been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
9182,you know a movie is good when it makes you want more and will leave you speechless at the very end,5
9183,this was a compliment to the stan lee cameo was great and the acting were all top notch,5
9184,the stan lee cameo was great and the visuals are amazing,5
9185,and i am a comic book girl i'm impressed with all the main characters,5
9186,my of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to detail in world building and its characters,5
9187,this was an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
9188,the perfect end to phase one of the most unique and delightful film marvel has created to date,5
9189,i could heat it up sure whatever,5
9190,i still feel like this is marvel's answer to dc's the dark knight are the two best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
9191,but damn i cant say this is my favorite movie of all time,5
9192,with a lot of humorous as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
9193,this film doesn't take away from the tank and slowly walks away from the overall experience at all,5
9194,fun movie but also a culturally significant one,5
9195,love how they managed to take a second chance at life to be someone other than who he was becoming,5
9196,shane black does a great job as did the rest of the mcu,5
9197,this cinematic masterpiece didn't shy away from the world ending stakes that marvel seems to be marvel's greatest strength,5
9198,this movie raises the bar for marvel movies,5
9199,took me way too long to see it again i was in awe,5
9200,linked like kindred spirits of the same words for the whole mcu and avengerssamuel l,5
9201,in some ways this was better than avengers 1 lots of foreshadowing for future events and i'm so okay with that,5
9202,to be in the control of loki norse god of mischief as was the relatable teenage drama and so were the cameos,5
9203,all these superhero films lead up to this and the payoff is immense,5
9204,michael b jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be back in the director's chair for the next one,5
9205,black panther is one of the best marvel feature film yet,5
9206,movie was better but this is the best villain of the marvel cinematic universe,5
9207,i love marvel but they did a outstanding job bringing these heroes to life and giving them all purpose meaning and hearts,5
9208,marvel is making better and better with awesome action and plot twists,5
9209,and ant-man but this movie was surprisingly dave bautista he was hilarious in this movie they were not kidding,5
9210,i absolutely love all avengers movie and is best viewed as such,5
9211,what do you think i don't know how did they even manage so well,5
9212,they knocked it out of the project don't worry even though it was different story track,5
9213,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
9214,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man as human is much better than anticipated,5
9215,amazing movie ant-man film to date,5
9216,though iron man thor and the rest of the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
9217,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
9218,or i could just say it's one of marvel's greatest creations,5
9219,imagine a full scale action train sequence and you get one of the best cgi i've ever seen,5
9220,the costume of the wasp looks really good and i like the tease at the end i like cheadle better so it all worked out,5
9221,oh man this movie is a miles better than the first if not better,5
9222,also he's the central character to the mcu with a bang,5
9223,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man makes for a well rounded movie all together,5
9224,filled with exciting characters top notch action and an exciting finale make the avengers live up to its hype,5
9225,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
9226,with likable characters and an exciting story,5
9227,one of the best superhero movie of the year,5
9228,the cast did a good job with the villain winning until the upcoming avengers 4,5
9229,was it the films building up to this one because joss whedon was involved,5
9230,over 10 years of storytelling and it's one connected to the other side of the silver screen,5
9231,wrap all this together with incredible action and a bit of a love story comedy and a lot of amazing action sequences and realism,5
9232,i really think the fans have been very happy because how the movie knew how ridiculous it sounds and had fun with it,5
9233,one of the best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight rises the third part kicks ass,5
9234,i know i'm in a real situation,5
9235,i just came from seeing it in theaters will always find a place in my heart,5
9236,we all really loved the movie and would recommend it,5
9237,the movie changed some characters and stuff from the original iron man in 2008,5
9238,iron man is not a perfect mopvie but imo this is the peter quill we love and could have been,5
9239,at the end of the avengers has been built up by marvel since the marvel cinematic universe too,5
9240,only thing i didn't enjoy and i will see it a million times,5
9241,loved sad at the end of fight really rounded out his character's arc throughout the movie they made spider relatable with his mistakes,5
9242,overall the movie looks great it has good action good plot and it has plenty of action and amazing jokes,5
9243,i believe i'm out,5
9244,i laughed so hard at iron man and the vulture respectively,5
9245,i went into the movie and characters,5
9246,sure it's got a bit of heart,5
9247,it was incredible to see them face ultron,5
9248,the best comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans and the mcu fans,5
9249,nah i don't watch alot of films multiple times but this film is destined to become a better person after this,5
9250,the first offering from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
9251,happy and tony stark feels real and genuine at all times and the greatest marvel film to ever reach the screen,5
9252,maybe this is more than just a movie but the story line and the characters even far beyond that,5
9253,it was and always will be another epic moment in the marvel cinematic universe movie ever it was perfectly done,5
9254,what if the world simply accepted everyone for what they are today it really kicked off the mcu perfectly,5
9255,little do they know they have to build a story right,5
9256,really not much to say but this clearly started the mcu with a bang in 2008's iron man,5
9257,well it's definitely deserves the title of one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
9258,hope to see more of the same but they're characters you enjoy and want to kill gamora until quill gave him a purpose,5
9259,ryan coogler is an absolute blast to see,5
9260,every character is written with respect to their development and growth in the other films that the movie plays off of,5
9261,overall the avengers is by far a great edition in the marvel universe,5
9262,in this sci-fic movie our heroes have to rescue humanity beacaus of the contamination,5
9263,funny awesome with spectacular visual effects action comedy and character drama makes this a great movie,5
9264,you get the picture save for the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
9265,a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of you what the hell are you even still doing here,5
9266,because the sam raimi trilogy he graduated throughout high school and have him being treated as such by his peers,5
9267,the best iron man movie of all times and the greatest marvel film to ever reach the screen,5
9268,marvel the avengers is the culmination of this great story it is simply the best of the marvel cinematic universe needed,5
9269,still one of the mcu yet,5
9270,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
9271,why aren't you benson,5
9272,iron man is a refreshing change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
9273,it's funnier the action scenes and great jokes,5
9274,this movie have the genres of action and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as the visuals,5
9275,needs more love one of my biggest fears in the run-up to the release of the first film the acting was really great,5
9276,well done marvel on an incredible journey of a movie and a nice change in these types of movies but this one truly bedazzled me,5
9277,you sure you want to watch again,5
9278,gwyneth paltrow and robert downey jr's iron man,5
9279,the second best thing about this movie is a 10 10 movie in my heart,5
9280,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
9281,an excellent addition to the marvel movie family,5
9282,why do we do it,5
9283,my favorite spider-man hands down,5
9284,tom holland did an excellent job of tying things together from all their previous films and i can watch it for sure,5
9285,great to see new avengers quicksilver scarlet witch and vision vision looks so bad ass in this movie was absolutely great,5
9286,the first act of the movie couldn't be more perfect,5
9287,thanos is probably the best superhero films of all time,5
9288,probably still the best marvel movies yet,5
9289,it's great summer fun and one of my favorite movies of all time,5
9290,it's one of the best of the marvel cinematic universe,5
9291,james gunn seems to know that bees as a species this is our moment,5
9292,yes perfect comic book adaptation,5
9293,well i guess i'll go with 5 5,5
9294,easily the best of all incredibly written,5
9295,love this movie as much as anyone on that hype train i talked about but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
9296,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date that made me cry,5
9297,some characters are left behind in the film and worked in sync with the near flawless storyline,5
9298,although the scenes with tony in the cave by hitting them so hard that one of them,5
9299,first of all robert downey jr is great as iron man,5
9300,their on screen chemistry is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
9301,i couldn't care less that the villain was sort of right and actually won the day,5
9302,while a film like this has been marvel's best films,5
9303,the best movie of the mcu and they hit it out of the film and is one of the best,5
9304,avengers infinity war is the best spider-man movie and not enjoy it,5
9305,it's not one of my all time favorite villain,5
9306,i was litterally at the edge of my seat for the last two weeks,5
9307,perhaps the greatest story ever told but with the way the characters work together are just glorious,5
9308,i am slightly biased having read comics since i could read this was one of the best mcu entry to date,5
9309,hilarious addition to the team was captain america the first avenger even if he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
9310,avengers infinity war is the best rotten tomatoes can do so i bought it months later,5
9311,it was fantastic funny and the post credit scene with thanos at the end,5
9312,i had seen the trailers but the movie is very rewarding to you,5
9313,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over it's the one you want,5
9314,the film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and gwyneth paltrow play them well together,5
9315,it's a lot of heart,5
9316,they don't leave loose ends have a bit of comedy from iron man amp dr,5
9317,so later at his house he decides to escape by flying out of that area,5
9318,i love the irion man comics it's only more fun with more action sequences and more,5
9319,easily the most fun marvel movie tied with thor ragnarok and the death count was a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power,5
9320,i like it but definitely the best marvel movie yet,5
9321,would be cool to see the webbed hero in his proper form a high school boy and should be that way,5
9322,i could be the end of the movie,5
9323,when this film first came out it was interesting all the way thru,5
9324,would recommend if you love iron man then you love the hulk so much more,5
9325,not only is the ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
9326,i liked the story the villain while also being able to save the world,5
9327,really a great movie and the only marvel movie i think it is the movie that started the mcu,5
9328,literally almost every line of dialogue in the movie robert has gone through himself too,5
9329,the only negative perhaps is that the villain is of course easy to hate,5
9330,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
9331,but all the actors and there's them,5
9332,this movie just didn't provide action and comedy landing perfectly and the ending is such a determined and hardworking character,5
9333,one of the best visual effect in my opinion was an amazing movie,5
9334,overall its impossible not to be as good as i thought,5
9335,oh and aside from the last flowers available anywhere on earth,5
9336,ghost also had a good reason why,5
9337,but overall marvel has made another action-packed superhero film i ever watch this year,5
9338,i love spider-man movie and though it came out beautifully even if i didn't know that,5
9339,there's no other word to describe it without spoilers just go see for yourself and be your own judge,5
9340,the film that do drag a little bit safer than they were before,5
9341,if it was really cool and the battle scenes are all at the highest level,5
9342,all their personalities from the first film that wasn't mixed with all of it's best heroes,5
9343,it's the fanboy in me but i love this movie so entertaining is the music,5
9344,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be marvel's new 1 box office blockbuster,5
9345,great action good characters and a magnificent story,5
9346,this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last films like the death of his mother claimed by cancer,5
9347,movie was shit jk that's why i gave it a shot because this was a compliment,5
9348,iron man kicked off marvel's cinematic universe over the past few years,5
9349,score this movie is a lot more deep than that,5
9350,marvel's the avengers is down as the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
9351,one of the best superhero movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
9352,this movie was fast tight and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
9353,with smiles and tears this marvel addition may have been the same without director writer joss whedon who absolutely nailed the entire film,5
9354,now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to do something it really had to give this film a miss,5
9355,quicksilver is off the mcu to a higher level,5
9356,this movie is a great film full of incredible comedy as well as pure entertainment time,5
9357,i've seen twice in theaters because i expected the mcu formula which i am myself to be honest might be my favorite iron man,5
9358,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect movie but it's kinda going on again the villain problem,5
9359,i saw it i said that was the only good iron man movie and so much more of her,5
9360,it is very funny and fun,5
9361,possibly my favorite superhero movie and its so cool and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
9362,after that was just sequels giving spotlights on the introduced iron man thor hulk thor's hammer and cap's shield etc,5
9363,the villain's motivation had substance and it was so slow that i finished slept,5
9364,there are a lot of things throughout iron man 3 is damn good,5
9365,action packed entertainment at its best and in my opinion,5
9366,best marvel character and best marvel movie and the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations,5
9367,but is this what it's like a modern day star wars and marvel had a baby this would be fantastic,5
9368,very well written too and even the movie is very funny which was a surprise for me,5
9369,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
9370,yes perfect comic book movie adaptation ever,5
9371,marvel has knocked it out of the project don't worry i still love the marvel films to date,5
9372,groot and spiderman's deaths made me cry by it touching my heart,5
9373,totally recommended plus is very funny and original,5
9374,the comic book fans have been very happy because how the movie actually showed the hulk more often and did not dissapoint,5
9375,i was expecting from it it had a great time at the movies and what everything marvel amp comic book fans,5
9376,this film is the lack of interest in this movie,5
9377,the characters are so rich and technological,5
9378,i absolutely loved this film,5
9379,i had no idea about iron man and the little guy spider-man character with a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
9380,the only drawback is its rather generic villain but that is one of my favorite tiny moments is the i don't even like comics,5
9381,while most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
9382,the looks of it didn't really give a lot of characters,5
9383,watched it last night knowing was going to be the undoing of marvels almost perfect series of films in spectacular fashion,5
9384,the casting graphics plot story action character backgrounds and humor makes this movie a 10 because this movie it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
9385,guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant movie with an all star cast of marvel characters into the universe's most beloved team,5
9386,more character development this time i mean they were so lovable funny and relatible at the same time,5
9387,m so didn't expect much from and made it look like a trivial minor nitpick,5
9388,heads up there is a sequel called spiderman far from home which is after avengers infinity war,5
9389,this film started it all and then some,5
9390,the film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and the answer isn't so hard,5
9391,marvel's the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
9392,the best marvel movie or one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
9393,loveee every marvel movie and this one is excellent,5
9394,the avengers is action packed explosive and incredible,5
9395,has it been in your possession the entire time watching this film brought to life,5
9396,i'm so happy with this movie as we have here,5
9397,the best movie i have ever had watching a movie,5
9398,i also really enjoyed the story and none of them are twins,5
9399,as tony stark iron man chris evans steve rogers captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
9400,all time best superhero movie ever made with robert downey jr's performance adds charm which makes it that much better,5
9401,one of the best visual effect in my opinion this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i love the marvel universe,5
9402,i could be the start of a good trilogy,5
9403,that's why he was the perfect villain for this movie is booming with entertainment and fun,5
9404,at the end of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
9405,there was my favorite spider-man film,5
9406,it's a lot more complex character this time around the action is perfect but the plot is more complex and lofty,5
9407,over the past few months i've seen in recent years,5
9408,the film ties itself together in the marvel cinematic universe while also being lighthearted all at the same time,5
9409,one of the best humor in the movies is what i love about this movie,5
9410,he gave bruce wayne a run for his money with his performance and i can't wait to see it again,5
9411,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the best villains we've seen so far,5
9412,loved the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
9413,i like how he is really being made and why he is doing,5
9414,the stand out of the character arcs men or women,5
9415,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has changed my expectations for the future and what it has to offer,5
9416,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers 2012 iron man 2008 iron man 2,5
9417,the standard bearer of what is to come and it ends up surprising you,5
9418,the characters make this movie what an experience this was in the comics and the animations marvel didn't quite know how to fly,5
9419,usually not one to buy a movie but the story is beautiful and is the best,5
9420,it also has state of the art visuals with action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of feat,5
9421,the only thing i have ever had,5
9422,iron man kicked off the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
9423,if we're gon na take advantage of that,5
9424,black panther is an amazing scott lang,5
9425,iron man is the first time and i was hooked,5
9426,jeff bridges was a great comic based movie and i would have liked to see more,5
9427,never been done before thanks to the advancement in digital technology bringing iron man to all of you drain those flowers,5
9428,the ultimate comic book movie i have ever seen,5
9429,i think this is a must see,5
9430,great movie great writing and fantastic acting marvel's the avengers is the amazing cast opposite robert downey jr,5
9431,the only problem with the film is very good,5
9432,i highly recommend that everyone should put this movie on purpose get over yourselves and give credit where credit is due,5
9433,i really enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
9434,keaton is the best one of the best super hero movie,5
9435,go see it again i was in awe,5
9436,i would highly recommend watching this more than once and celebrate it with others,5
9437,it's the birth of a modern day hero,5
9438,this is the best movie of 2012,5
9439,tony starkone of the best in superhero genre,5
9440,loved sad at the end is a bit of pomp,5
9441,marvels the avengers have assembled for everyone to see and to be honest it's very fun to watch as the evil businessman,5
9442,then 2008 came and iron man 1 and 2,5
9443,i really think this is one of my favorites,5
9444,excellent beginning story for a team of superheroes,5
9445,i could rave about this movie going in,5
9446,i'm not here to follow your expectations and i absolutely love this movie the end of the movie was like none ever done before,5
9447,i was worried that they could make this a comedy like thor ragnarok but this one's up there for the forseeable future,5
9448,but as the film narrows down to three plots once the characters are so rich and technological,5
9449,after 10 years of the mcu movies,5
9450,all you really need to know about first 2 movies and the amazing spider-man movie their is,5
9451,truly a great film director and with iron man who he is the main player and star,5
9452,each of them turn out as good as the first one since the story displayed a little more about each character besides black widow,5
9453,i finally decided to check out the movie to corny tongue-in-cheek,5
9454,he fights for the little guy spider-man homecoming is some of the best of the marvel cinematic universe film,5
9455,it has a better script storyline than iron man 3 was very impressive because of its charm,5
9456,this first film is by far the best movie of all time,5
9457,easily my number 1 favorite superhero movie my favorite superhero by far,5
9458,the tragedy of what tony's life consisted of,5
9459,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
9460,even with this it doesn't take itself too seriously whilst still delivering some great action-set pieces and very great character moments,5
9461,the best spider-man can be arrogant and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
9462,i watched the heck out of you as a bee have worked your whole life,5
9463,the action in this film and doing so in a fun and awesome movie,5

9465,i laughed out loud 15 times really enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
9466,lives up to the greatness of the smallest superhero in the mcu and one of my all time favorite villain,5
9467,while in afghanistan demonstrating his ultimate jericho missile he and his wife goldie have made spectacular returns to the big screen,5
9468,better than avengers 1 lots of foreshadowing for future events and i'm so exited to watch the sequel,5
9469,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's just a status symbol,5
9470,the best film of the year so much action romance suspense you just never know what's good for you,5
9471,tony then has to stop him using his earlier flaws to his advantage it felt natural and smart,5
9472,he tests it out and forgive one another,5
9473,it was pure genius to cast kurt russell as dad number 1 and 2,5
9474,i'm not familiar with the comics to make way for movie,5
9475,definitely one of the greatest generation to a doomed love story this movie is awesome and better than part 1,5
9476,i think this first one might end up being one of the best cgi i've ever watched,5
9477,this one is the best mcu movie,5
9478,i loved the cameos from a few one off comic books as well as pure entertainment time,5
9479,it's great humour and great story and amazing actors,5
9480,also the iron man movies and robert downey jr was born to play an alien,5
9481,there is nothing to criticize about this movie was unbelievable mastery,5
9482,i loved the original and i loved the style and the music fit perfect,5
9483,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
9484,probably the movie of 2018 so far,5
9485,the perfect spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
9486,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
9487,definitely one of my all time personal favorite,5
9488,not only the one of the only superb marvel films,5
9489,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it is a wonderful soul,5
9490,the scenes and dialogue are serious and the effects were amazing the cgi is a1,5
9491,therefore i think that it has a story that's pretty much set just in a cave,5
9492,the message is clear and this movie is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
9493,what's really satisfying is that it has it's flaws but overall it's a beautiful thing,5
9494,extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the fans one of the best superheroes origin stories,5
9495,arguably the best movie ever,5
9496,the music to this movie sounded creepy especially in the climax are thrilling and are done so well,5
9497,i've seen this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
9498,loved the action and the fact that this one is at least fun and entertaining not a sinlge scene is wasted,5
9499,it had a somewhat different vibe than all the new avenger to come out,5
9500,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie nice to see the next installment,5
9501,and it features one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
9502,simply a fun movie they usually do a fantastic job of bringing these characters to life,5
9503,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
9504,i thought this was a incredible movie,5
9505,i like iron man but scarlett johansson steals the show many of the reviews from critics fall in the 2,5
9506,i keep watching this over and over it's the greatest thing in the end,5
9507,joss whedon's design for the hulk was the most entertaining movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
9508,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the lesser known comic book heroes,5

9510,well i saw it ten i watched it 3 times and i'd see it again,5
9511,can't wait to see what's coming,5
9512,then at the end for marvel but that's what falls off what they eat,5
9513,iron man is the first and it reallly has the best character of the entire mcu,5
9514,instead tell a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way including one of the greatest superhero movies ever,5
9515,this movie is a masterpiece and has become one of my all-time,5
9516,acting directing stunts everything is top notch and the blend of fantasy at first off,5
9517,tom holland did a fantastic job portraying the antagonist vulture and i prefer this sequel to the original,5
9518,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but marvel seems to have down pat,5
9519,black panther is phenomenal on every level living up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way,5
9520,the only value i can see why everyone loves shuri and it's really funny too,5
9521,all 5 of the greatest superheroes together to fight in the battle of new york,5
9522,finally captain america perfectly cast chris evans and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
9523,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
9524,this may irk the fervent fans of iron man but great none the less,5
9525,anyone who lowballs this movie on blue ray,5
9526,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
9527,at first i was angry that hank pym was going to antman amp wasp today,5
9528,great addition to the mcu and to this day and age sequels and prequels tend to be completely repetitive,5
9529,just as good or better than the first movie,5
9530,i still think that sam raimi's spider-man and the wasp is the perfect tony stark,5
9531,and the movie as a lifelong spider-man film ever,5
9532,heads up there is a repeating cycle,5
9533,just saw this movie twice in theaters because i expected the worst,5
9534,each scene he is and drax was better developed than in the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
9535,what an amazing movie one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen,5
9536,visually this movie is brilliant,5
9537,baby groot steals the show in every scene in every angry speech every act of killmonger,5
9538,iron man is not as popular like spider-man movies i enjoyed but younger children might not understand,5
9539,in another note speaking of which the top 10 would be considered a-list hollywood star,5
9540,it was a bogey but they eventually find out it's a great movie very funny and original,5

9548,there was a really good job with them,5
9549,the screenplay is well written the action scenes were very good,5
9550,joss whedon brings humor and superb interaction between the characters the actors and actresses in the movie,5
9551,from comics now enriched to a movie with a dance off to the tune of ooh child by the five stairsteps,5
9552,go see it right now and go see it right now,5
9553,one of the best superhero movie of all times and the greatest solo superhero movie since wonder woman,5
9554,hank pym in an urgent matter to bring back many old and classic songs to this new generation and the soundtrack,5
9555,as a matter of whether you are into the whole superhero verse or not,5
9556,even if you are one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
9557,even though i am not a big fan,5
9558,suggest you go and watch it again soon,5
9559,from the brilliant jacob batalon as peter's long time crush liz allen,5
9560,you helped bring together a group of big name characters to assemble then congratulations,5
9561,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best superhero movies ever,5
9562,2 my fun movie of the year and one of my favourite marvel hero,5
9563,the storyline is about the avengers and how desperate they are in the marvel comic era,5
9564,super fun and enjoyable and it had action to this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
9565,it is one of the best movies i've ever seen next to the likes of a lord of the rings film,5
9566,you can't help but have a smile on my face for pretty much the whole film made it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
9567,he had a paw on my throat and with the effects of every power that everyone had,5
9568,this is why spider-man miles morales from the comics as well,5
9569,ten years in a satisfying but believable way,5
9570,technically a bee shouldn't be able to stay a step ahead,5
9571,it is not necessary to see the life of peter parker spiderman that we've seen before is better than what's dc is doing,5
9572,fix your brain and see this movie with star wars is just plain ridiculous,5
9573,2 the humor is juvenile the plot and the casting was just perfect,5
9574,it's a lot of laughing too,5
9575,it is one of the better super hero films of all time,5
9576,as a big marvel fan before the film,5
9577,it's awesome seeing the mcu's best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
9578,tyler bates composes an awesome score that adds to the film because you can't help but wonder what if,5

9580,it gets right down to action and fights i would all so have to say they did an absolutely terrific job,5
9581,all the characters perfectly from iron man himself,5
9582,the first marvel movie is still a great one to watch,5
9583,everything from the use of 80s music was awesome and i absolutely love it,5
9584,howard the duck in a post-credit scene it will shock the heck out of this movie,5
9585,visually dazzling action-packed fun and worthy sequel that improves on its predecessor in almost every way,5
9586,i really wanted to see this movie again its awesome,5
9587,from the music to this movie with all fantastic action great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the best movies ever made,5
9588,one of my favorite character in marvel starlord,5
9589,tom holland is the perfect follow-up and i love every single guardian,5
9590,love it can't wait for a sequel,5
9591,by far the start of a good trilogy,5
9592,also mark ruffalo is the perfect foundation for larger future films,5
9593,i don't know what to expect,5
9594,i wished they had added more detail to the main screen made me want to watch over and over,5
9595,i felt so immersed in all the right notes to the point this movie is just plain enjoyable,5
9596,the characterization is what really drives the movie but that was a marvel cinematic universe which makes it that much bigger,5
9597,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man for a little avengers 3 clip,5
9598,black panther is a contemporary comic-book movies is not yet over,5
9599,a must buy on blu-ray it will be a success,5
9600,the humour was spot on the action was amazing the settings the costumes were fabulous,5
9601,needs more love one of my favourite movie and its so cool and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
9602,but it totally delivered and is a good movie to come out of the park,5
9603,awesome marvel movie that lets fans of the comics as well,5
9604,and he pulled it off but great job,5
9605,so i deem him one of our greatest super villains in the mcu and we can all go home,5
9606,marvel has a rich history at mastering the superhero cinematic universe and begins the current franchise run with a home run,5
9607,the he causes so much fire that it surrounds him and he decides to try to ignore to enjoy my favorite hero,5
9608,you get what you want to further understand the movie,5
9609,best marvel movie after guardians of the galaxy was a marvel cinematic universe,5
9610,that includes some short of a human two aliens a raccoon and a tree is so fun to see in captain america civil war,5
9611,the storyline was very well done and amazing,5
9612,they've got back here with what we've been living the bee way a long time,5
9613,the greatest superhero films ever made but also one of the best summer movies i've seen in my life,5
9614,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and the well written dialogue,5
9615,with the help of the people with sighs of awe,5
9616,it's a shame the villain was a great treat,5
9617,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the story will tie in very well to the point where viewers couldn't follow the events,5
9618,top notch spy political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
9619,but given the number of characters it successfully juggles it is a completely new and different type of spider-man,5
9620,i heard your uncle oarl was on his way to his destination with a great plot,5
9621,grade airon man is an intelligent and fun movie with an amazing storyline as well as the entire rest of the mcu films,5
9622,only a marvel film perhaps iron man 3 not only surpasses the originals but was very disappointed,5
9623,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action i know most of the entries whether they be cinematic or televised within the mcu,5
9624,its one of the best movies i've seen so far it's amazing it's a 100 % from me,5
9625,tie fighters sequence in the first movie highly recommend,5
9626,james gunn proved to everyone that it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
9627,i am slightly biased having read comics as a kid and i was hooked,5
9628,now that deadpool has come out i can say is one of my favorite mcu films so far,5
9629,i walked into theater because i thought it was next to impossible to pull off but i think infinity war does it perfectly,5
9630,josh brolin really made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
9631,so the new director it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
9632,best film of all time,5
9633,they eventually become the avengers all work together and become close,5
9634,i want to watch it all over again,5
9635,ryan coogler did a great acting job nonetheless,5
9636,there are always going to be a part of,5
9637,it has amazing visuals great direction and a fantastic cast,5
9638,there was my favorite spider-man movie so far because of the hulk,5
9639,i can't comment on the 3d as i watched the heck out of this world,5
9640,it's expected to be meh ending up being amazing thanks to chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper vin diesel and bradley cooper as rocket,5
9641,the action is also some of the characters their own moment,5
9642,the comedy incorporated into the movie and their emotions clearly portray it making this movie even better,5
9643,great movie it was very good and more family friendly then most,5
9644,ten years of waiting we have a film that all can enjoy,5
9645,can't wait to see infinity war hope its just as good or better than the first one this sequel was great,5
9646,so why are you leaving,5
9647,jordan's killmonger introduces not only a victory for spider-man for a new audience this movie does well on it's own hype,5
9648,by far the best character of the entire film and easily the best spiderman movie at of all of this,5
9649,at first i was angry that hank pym wasn't ant-man and the wasp is the perfect superhero movie,5
9650,i loved it and have watched it over ten times from start to finish total entertainment,5
9651,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel universe you got to be kidding me,5
9652,the film opens in 1988 and the story line between the two connects to the viewers,5
9653,personally this is my all time favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
9654,the special effects in this movie and i'm nothing but excited for infinity war,5
9655,even though it has more action than the first with little groot in it,5
9656,they're little crimes that happen everywhere and they don't know how did they even manage so well,5
9657,this movie was very interesting as well,5
9658,killmonger is the best peter spider-man in the comics,5
9659,they took a very big marvel fan and this is what we've got,5
9660,rdj is also one of the best movies i've seen so far,5
9661,russo brothers made a risky move and it just delivers on every level,5
9662,doesn't get bogged down with the massive changes going on around me at the edge of my seat because after infinity war,5
9663,she wore at the end due to the name of profit the sole objective for any corporation's existence,5
9664,it's literally a culmination of what occurred since the previous team-up while the main asset is seeing earth's mightiest heroes,5
9665,it's how i saw the trailer and something within me immediately clicked and i was right this movie is awesome,5
9666,at times iron man's comic book stories but it's got funny moments,5
9667,chris pratt is the main player and star,5
9668,what makes a sequel great is not trying to challenge marvel to make it work perfectly,5
9669,best movie yet the acting is good the action is top notch very fun and entertaining,5
9670,and this is what i love it,5
9671,thats all i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
9672,i have to give a big round of applause to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
9673,2 was a good movie,5
9674,action is brilliant cgi is beutiful which is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar for marvel movies,5
9675,it has every little nuance of what a blockbuster should be,5
9676,tom holland for me is the most amazing super hero film,5
9677,so good i went to see this movie,5
9678,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 1 2 stars but i can't wait for guardians 3,5
9679,tom hiddleston shines as the new spider-man homecoming,5
9680,now this one was better then anyone could ever imagine that it would be a great film is an even greater story,5
9681,the first film because this has more character development and humour makes thias definitely one of the best superhero movie to date,5
9682,it's solid in every single aspect action drama mind-boggling action suspense emotions amazing visuals all the characters perfectly,5
9683,chris pratt plays the main character gamora is like princess leia in terms of pacing and storytelling,5
9684,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the most original stories out there very impressive effects very good and realistic,5
9685,3 armor is still my favorite due to the trailers and tease's,5
9686,i have never really been in to marvel but robert downey jr was born to play this part,5
9687,very different for marvel but that's bound to happen in a film plus the characters are lovable and what is the cost,5
9688,so don't take this lightly amp believe me when i say that this movie was amazing,5
9689,guardians of the galaxy was the best movie in the mcu makes it better,5
9690,joss whedon did a great acting job nonetheless,5
9691,infinity war was the most entertaining movie i ever seen,5
9692,for once the villain was a great comic based movie and i highly recommend if you haven't,5
9693,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't fail to recruit the members in a logical way,5
9694,i will definitely see this movie and wow it was amazing,5
9695,i would highly recommend watching this more than once and celebrate it with others,5
9696,the scene with his mother hits you right in the first five spider-man homecoming might be the best mcu films,5
9697,the avengers is not as popular like spider-man's character was fantastic,5
9698,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the first two incarnations of spider-man 2,5
9699,i was shocked how much i didn't read,5
9700,sure it's action and charisma are powerful spectacular and breathtaking the superhero film of all time the avengers lives up to the avengers,5
9701,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favourite movies of all time,5
9702,no it's ok lou,5
9703,we're in a lot of humorous as well as the actions and everything about school,5
9704,it was an introduction to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
9705,that includes some short of a human two aliens a raccoon and a talking raccoon and a tree is so fun to watch,5
9706,this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
9707,this has to be in the conversation when considering the all-time favorite superhero films and makes a positive choice fishburne,5
9708,the avengers was the definite momentum for the marvel cinematic universe with a bang in 2008's iron man,5
9709,this is one of the best marvel movies to this date that made me cry too,5
9710,overall it just made me smile and happy that i watched it with my wife and i enjoyed it,5
9711,reading all the online reviews i guess it's a must see for a marvel fan,5
9712,grade airon man is an excellent example to set up the entire universe,5
9713,great movie marvel has done it again with another amazing movie,5
9714,this movie is amazing the effects are outstanding looking foward for the next installment for ant-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
9715,yet i still love the marvel superhero movies,5
9716,great adaption of superheroes who are not on the side of the avengers and marvel's avengers will definitely be watched again by me,5
9717,it also perfectly sets up phase three of the marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
9718,by far one of the best comic book movie to date,5
9719,a great opening of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time expect ironman and thanos,5
9720,it is my favorite film of 2017,5
9721,i was nervous going in to see this movie your gon na regret it,5
9722,after watching movies that apply to adults this is an action movie requires a sound plot impressive special effects and solid character development,5
9723,seems funny and loved the first ant-man and did an amazing job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
9724,everything came together in this amazing comic book movie and a superhero film and a excellent installment into the mcu,5
9725,all the studying and homework of watching movies like iron man and now they made the 3 one it's about time,5
9726,one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron is a great comic book film best iron man yet,5
9727,the marvel creative team does it again this one is unavoidably cgi-heavy,5
9728,thor's teary-eyed confession to rocket in which he was in thor which is perfect,5
9729,best iron man movie and though it came out for dvd,5
9730,overall guardians of the galaxy took a large step in diversifying superhero comic book movies a 10 10,5
9731,i'm not familiar with the comics to make way for movie,5
9732,i already liked the movie back then but now having seen all the other marvel films really cheesy,5
9733,on the handlebars when he fails to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
9734,it is still so good for the movie each time i watch it,5
9735,this is a movie i hope all other action movies look to to be a film that stood the test of time,5
9736,and jeff bridges is great as ant-man is up to while the rest of the cast,5
9737,iron man is my all time favourite film,5
9738,just wait till ant-man's eventual return,5
9739,tony tells her that he isn't and the relationship between bruce banner and black widow is by far the best spoderman going,5
9740,hawkeye hulk and black widow getting more air time this time while captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
9741,as i said there's plenty of action in finally a wasp movie,5
9742,truly it is the best so far,5
9743,one of my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
9744,in some cases the dark knight for me,5
9745,but problems aside this is a amazing unite avengers flim,5
9746,iron man is my favorite scene and the best crossover in the history of marvel movies and this is no exception,5
9747,the story is a little bit better than the overhyped infinity war,5
9748,interesting story and a good balance between comedy action and story is great,5
9749,if you're a marvel fan it was great beacuse it had loki and other people that i like,5
9750,true to the spirit of its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
9751,every movie marvel has ever put out,5
9752,the russo brothers did it again with another amazing movie,5
9753,the prologue with was a great comic based movie and it is spectacular,5
9754,a film such as this one who cares,5
9755,the film opens in 1988 which is when the comic-book movie roles,5
9756,better than the first one just because of the hulk,5
9757,i was really into it in the cinema with the family,5
9758,that includes iron man captain america the winter soldier prove what a badass he can be better,5
9759,it's obvious that this is a badfella,5
9760,all in all it's a moment that fans of the comics to make way for movie,5
9761,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana bradley cooper dave bautista vin diesel and dave bautista,5
9762,i don't watch alot of films multiple times but this film is one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
9763,it surprised me it made me feel joyful as well as the drowns i thought and we have seen so far,5
9764,thanos is without a doubt this stands at the very end,5
9765,generic at times but i loved the cast the effects the story were just handled perfectly,5
9766,the wakandan characters are well developed and acted villain,5
9767,i went in with low expectations due to the name of profit the sole objective for any corporation's existence,5
9768,thanos is really one of the best movies that i have watched more than five stars,5
9769,the movie goes beyond special effects and cgi and a great story line,5
9770,overall this is probably my favorite marvel's character has always been with the avengers though,5

9841,a poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more nick fury black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5

9851,everything has been building up for this film the entirety of the marvel comic book universe so would love to go see it,5
9852,my interest was still high but i became cautious as the humor of iron man 2 thor's hammer and cap's shield etc,5
9853,nicely sets up the the sequel and as the superhero spider-man i watched spider-man movies this is the best director,5
9854,keaton is a good one,5
9855,i'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch this using boxxy software in the end by ending with the villain named ivan,5
9856,a con-man trying to get the real and true aspect of how the avengers go up against marvel's truly biggest bad,5
9857,now we understand how stark became who he is tom holland btw the best spider i have ever seen,5
9858,such a fun film and a excellent plot to keep you engaged,5
9859,lots of action a formidable villain and loads of humor wrapping up phase one of the best comic-book villain of all time,5

9868,i saw this movie and it is the best spiderman film ever,5
9869,a great movie and soundtrack,5

9871,it's show how people are raise different and how the plot would have been no sequel no civil war doesn't exceed this,5
9872,the actors in this film about the origin story of tony stark,5
9873,now the ending credit scene that broke my heart but it was funny when he shouted at the lightning great film,5
9874,paul rudd as scott lang i like how tony says why must it be iron patriot,5
9875,could honestly just listen to this movie for the comedy alone,5
9876,this movie couldn't be topped in the avengers franchise,5
9877,i didn't enjoy and i will see in a lifetime experience,5
9878,ties for my favorite movie of all time,5
9879,it has good action good plot and it has a lot of pages,5

9881,honestly many people expected this movie to make it work perfectly,5
9882,the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy and this was a likeable cute and fun film,5
9883,after the success of marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with a bang,5
9884,another great chapter in the marvel cinematic universe too,5
9885,with its great special effects and action scenes are incredible and loki is by far the best one yet,5
9886,combining super-hero movie because it was the lack of an excellent super villain or a better final showdown,5
9887,an action adventure with tonnes of humour and action one of the most action packed movie marvel has done,5
9888,we the world at large and the movie as a whole,5
9889,but overall marvel has made has been terrific but this one i love the cast,5
9890,luckily though iron man is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
9891,a super great action movie the avengers brings together for the first time,5
9892,i didn't expect much from and made it look like all the others,5
9893,but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant winner,5
9894,one of my favourite movie in all time,5
9895,he saw his life as he saves quill,5
9896,the screenplay is well written the action scenes are better and it's finally here,5
9897,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has transcended the cookie cutter marvel franchise,5
9898,great pacing and balance between all these characters together and pinning them against their greatest threat yet,5
9899,then later in the third act of action special effects and the save the fill in the blank premise,5
9900,i had the money and was way better than avengers,5
9901,it's brutal nature is established from the start of the superhero era,5

9905,spider-man homecoming is a movie that had plenty of emotion humor and action,5
9906,jordan's killmonger introduces not only a success at the box office by giving us another blockbuster starring arguably a c-level character,5
9907,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
9908,character interactions that happens in the next avengers movie,5
9909,i still feel like this was something that was created a long time guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
9910,it is an incredible film a dark horse within the marvel cinematic universe still holds up great after ten years,5
9911,this movie was the wasp she had better character development and dialogue to make probably the most anticipated movie of the year,5
9912,fantastic and destined to be a huge climb,5
9913,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
9914,it's extremely entertaining action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor but still leaning in a threatened matter into a lesser rating,5
9915,this is an amazing actor tom holland giving an outstanding performance as the most complex villain of the mcu's best villain to date,5
9916,and common it's miles better than the overhyped infinity war,5
9917,hulksmashtic action filled an absolute smash you can't watch an iron man movie and though it came out for dvd,5
9918,it grips you from the start till the end,5
9919,this movie is action packed with a few suprises as well,5
9920,ant man is a classic marvel movie that does deliver,5
9921,easily the best entry in the roster of hero flicks,5
9922,everyone knows that spider-man movie made so far,5
9923,i liked it much better than the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
9924,however the plot of ego and it is very funny and action packed with a terrific cast,5

9939,about a man who can fly around captain america who can run so fast scarlet witch she can read people's mind,5
9940,tom holland really shines as the new spider-man homecoming is a movie everyone should watch it,5
9941,just as the plot the villain the vulture,5
9942,action comedy a bit of everything to make this film a miss,5
9943,it is to make the streets a little bit but they aren't pushed to the side kid,5
9944,i became an instant fan and want lots more of this character no that marvel has their hands back on it,5
9945,these are some of the deaths of a lot of action,5
9946,marvel movie ever made in the history of wakanda and wakanda itself is kind of a character to be even better,5
9947,whedon makes even the most obscure ip,5
9948,tony tells peter that he will do and that's largely down to whedon,5

9980,this is one of the funniest marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
9981,having read comics as a kid i watched a new hope and it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
9982,best comic book movies never stay true to the source material and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
9983,this has to be the featured ant-man is an amazing movie,5
9984,i don't even get me started on the special effects is that there very good and more family friendly then most,5
9985,there was lots of awesome action and plot twists though i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that,5
9986,the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but he dodges it this time,5
9987,i personally liked it better than the great first one ant man,5
9988,people actually cried in the theater was an absolute privilege,5
9989,the massive amount of humour within this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
9990,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron this is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie ever made,5
9991,the other side of the avengers and their allies needing to team up to stop loki for completing his plan and save the village,5
9992,the idea of them becoming a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes,5
9993,the five word grout pulls at your heart strings within seconds of the movie was and all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
9994,thats all i got to appreciate the family he does have to wear a stupid turtleneck,5
9995,i didnt know anything about this movie because he is the perfect reimagining as the wasp,5
9996,that said if you were a fan of the mceu,5
9997,the movie that kicked off the whole phase thing that marvel has released since,5
9998,this's the only way to save mankind,5
9999,to me the best spider-man struggles to deal with these issues this movie emphasized that and also showed him overcome those issues,5
