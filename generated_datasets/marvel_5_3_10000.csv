22,even though i am not a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
23,enjoyed this film even though it's gon na be one super summer,5
24,that was a little bit,5
25,one of the best marvel and the best performance in this role to date,5
26,best spiderman movie at of all of this is when how the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to work together and become close,5
27,why do we do now,5
28,just when you think a series like the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron is not the action but the comedy,5
29,the movie is basically perfect and deserves real credit for the emotional part of the movie was amazing the settings the costumes were fabulous,5
30,marvel brings the whole cast is radiant,5
31,the standard bearer of what is known as the tesseract to teleport himself back to earth,5
32,starks humour mixed with everyone else in the theatre,5
33,this movie is thanos who is maybe the best marvel movie to date,5
34,overall i'd give avengers infinity war is the best villain in comic book movies acquire,5
35,let's not forget it's the best marvel movie hands down,5
36,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
37,but we don't need this,5
38,all star cast of marvel characters into the universe's creation,5
39,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together as the avengers assemble,5
40,and the women are awesome,5
41,my second favorite of the marvel cinematic universe,5
42,easily one of the best spider-man movie and so on,5
43,a predominantly black cast which takes place in africa and still manages to tell a good story great character interaction,5
44,and also michael keaton as our villain,5
45,yes the cgi work is very good and had great actors,5
46,spider-man 2 due to its great story excellent performances and an off the charts with this movie,5
47,it was a very fun fresh take on spider-man film to date,5
48,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
49,the best hulk movie so far because of the time nowãâ °,5
50,this was probably one of my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
51,the best comic book film best iron man movie made so far,5
52,granted there were many successful super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
53,the fact that it wasn't comedic it was emotionally gripping,5
54,i had a blast with this mcu film and that is my favorite thing about this movie was thanos,5
55,itdont have to much songs but in the community as well,5
56,overall a great film that was perfect for each of their comedic abilities to the maximum potential,5
57,the cgi sucked but that's more of an introduction story than an origin story,5
58,a brilliant film filled with great sequences,5
59,we are able to make such good films is frankly amazing,5
60,avengers infinity war was a great bruce banner and i wished he was in the beginning of this movie,5
61,well if it is made is going to be a film that is also outstanding is the action sequences were the bomb,5
62,from comics now enriched to a movie with a lot of collateral damage like all mcu but just so much entertainment,5
63,are we going to be stupid but it actually surpassed expectations,5
64,he has since built a suit similar to tony's iron man benedict cumberbatch's doctor strange and josh brolin's thanos,5
65,as tony stark iron man to this day my all time personal favorite,5
66,you could tell it was going to be a big flop and not only do they do so but they ace the s,5
67,i'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch this movie over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
68,ant-man makes for a great roller-coaster film marvel fans hope for,5
69,rdj is also one of the most original superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
70,story line phenomenal characters are interesting good amount of comedy and of action adventure violence,5
71,the acting is very good and entertaining characters and great humor,5
72,it doesn't feels like a real teenager,5
73,it ties into everything the mcu was a lot of surprises but what it did give me was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
74,at the core of a great film is the best movie i have ever seen,5
75,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
76,so if your looking for a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around awesome movie,5
77,definitely one of the best spider-man character till this movie,5
78,overall the plot was generic,5
79,while i found thor ragnarok to be a hero without a suit,5
80,yeah they change a lot of cgi but they implemented it terrifically into the film,5
81,the tragedy of what tony's life consisted of,5
82,i've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid i watched a new hope and it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
83,he gains his powers because he wants his friends and family are the most important people in our life,5
84,marvel's the avengers and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
85,one of those characters died i would have felt their pain,5
86,what's more is that it has a great cast effects and a nice change of pace,5
87,it is a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
88,i look forward for his work on the latest spider-man film so fuck those film,5
89,great story telling great action and juggling a massive cast of characters well,5
90,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers assemble,5
91,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
92,whilst i had the money and was way better than the first one,5
93,trailer after trailer it didn't really had in comics,5
94,one of the first guardians film is the best spiderman movie yet,5
95,it was a little over the top all out action from minute one,5
96,but this one is a little bit better,5
97,showing the colorful bright space and not the least bit preachy,5
98,you have to put on top of that rich depth of its characters dialogue tension set design and action,5
99,hope to see all of these origin stories off the ground,5
100,as for the rest of your team,5
101,this is definitely one of my favorites the fifth element was a movie that exceeds all expectations,5
102,3 armor is still my favorite mcu movie,5
103,2 is the best spider-man movie there is no more stars but if i could,5
104,it didn't have much interest until i saw it in theaters an hour ago but i'm loving this color,5
105,cineworldyatethere are two teasers at the start of the marvel comic book movie to date,5
106,it was a good movie with some even better actors,5
107,hope they make another one of marvel's success,5
108,the visuals were so cool and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
109,if anything can live up to the hype,5
110,if you're a fan of the mceu,5
111,a fun and thrilling lots of laughs and wonderful to finally see everyone come together as a team,5
112,this picture is my new favorite mcu films,5
113,the best movie i have ever seen in my life,5
114,it's not a two dimensional team wonderful that bands together to fight in the battle of new york barry bee benson v,5
115,i believe i'm out,5
116,i want to watch the next one,5
117,you helped bring together a series of films in spectacular fashion,5
118,iron man is one of the most powerful amp memorable lines in the movie had tons of action and comedy,5
119,black widow doesn't have the same emotional heartbreak as infinity war has been 10 years in the making,5
120,i'd rate it 9 10 but 5 is the best crossover in the history of cinema,5
121,a phenomenal film that really shows how great of a villain thanos is probably the most re-watchable marvel movie as of today,5
122,everyone knows that spider-man homecoming might be the best mcu movie before it was completely phrased,5
123,before everyone gathered this was the best movie in the world period,5
124,best one to this one in all angles referring back to the real spiderman is amazing,5
125,the sequel to the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe,5
126,i don't see a live action movie now that i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
127,i loved every part of this movie a very underrated film as a whole,5
128,an amazing way of bringing 10 years of plot building and character development,5
129,i actually was sad watching the villain die something i've never seen a movie with a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
130,not only did her character provide a unique story ark but she wasn't a wonder why i became fat around this time,5
131,i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
132,and you're one of them and i want them to go on,5
133,the story had some hiccups but the writing is sharp the dialogue is great,5
134,you don't like each other at fist and there is so much fun doesn't take itself seriously,5
135,the humor and charm that we've ever seen,5
136,i thought this movie was very funny yet was able to do what has never been this good,5
137,amazing special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe and is still better than almost everything that marvel has ever come up with,5
138,well balanced action and character development unfold into an awesome movie,5
139,the plot is well done and it completes the movie,5
140,so great to see all of the previous 18 movies,5
141,stan lee makes his appearance in a short news interviews saying superheroes in new york city and it's really really great,5
142,but as a stand-alone movie this is where a legendary cinematic universe all started,5
143,one of the best superhero movie of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless,5
144,well if you know anything about this movie,5
145,saw it yesterday and it is the best marvel movie and the first part,5
146,i thought it was going to be arguments and possibly fights,5
147,even if you are a superhero movie and more of a feature in a marvel super hero movie of all time,5
148,you going to the next one to come out,5
149,this really is not to be as good as the first,5
150,i am slightly biased having read comics since i could read this was one of the best villians of all time,5
151,marvel brings the whole cast has a good heart and a solid message,5
152,an entertaining movie with lots of olives and extra olives,5
153,it was really funny and the post credit cliff hanger scenes,5
154,a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie its funny action packed,5
155,this movie was so much better but this is just how i was raised,5
156,the best and also funniest super hero movies that fall into the wrong hands it can completely destroy the universe,5
157,our favorite ragtag galactic group returns in guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best marvel movie by far,5
158,the world and characters are so good and so well developed,5
159,a great story with a great balance of action and humor,5
160,the cinematography the story the villain while also being exciting,5
161,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 out of 5 stars,5
162,tom holland is by far one of the greater superhero movies and it is done masterfully and with absolute cleverness,5
163,but while starks spends significant amount of time in his own solo movie as black panther is a small gem a masterpiece,5
164,way better than the first one since the story displayed a little more about each character besides black widow,5
165,now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to fulfill the mission before few other parties reach them,5
166,this movie is a movie that no one asked for,5
167,marvel the avengers is by far the best movie of the year,5
168,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is one of the best marvel flicks,5
169,our whole group young and old laughed and had a huge impact on him,5
170,black panther should be the characters are handled very well each character in the mcu will probably feel lost at times,5
171,real nice film with a villain that you can not miss,5
172,the combination of good actors visuals story and soundtrack and ryan coogler and wanting to see so bad,5
173,if anybody needs to make a crossover with the avengers,5
174,ok i admit i am a comic book movie,5
175,like if they had the chance if they had made him use spiderman to show off their abilities,5
176,i was not sure if i would like to see more of,5
177,a masterpiece of action that saw one of the best mcu film and that is shown in the trailer,5
178,definitely in my top 3 marvel movies tom holland was perfectly casted as peter parker spider-man struggles to deal with things like this,5
179,and unlike any other superhero movie there is doublecrossing tricking people in this movie was tony starks,5
180,i look forward for his work on the latest spider-man movie to date,5
181,great movie it was emotional,5
182,amazing collaboration of the mcu is gamora who we find out is one of the greatest comic book movies,5
183,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
184,this could be the start of a good trilogy,5
185,as i said at the beginning when he was pulled into action,5
186,in addition the combination of good actors visuals story and soundtrack and ryan coogler and wanting to see it,5
187,funny i just can't get it,5
188,the prologue with was a great addition to the mcu,5
189,a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama,5
190,the avengers is by far the start up of the mcu to new heights and we still have not come down from it yet,5
191,not feeding into the hype but it is also so much more looking once again at you warners,5
192,it has good characters solid writing and a very speical thanks to the advancement in digital technology bringing iron man to date,5
193,fast paced with plenty of splendid action and a great edition in the marvel fandom,5
194,the first offering from marvel studios is doing a great job with their performances,5
195,sure you're on a journey like the rest of the movie you must watch,5
196,where is the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
197,my favorite line the whole movie was great,5
198,she was the weakest point of the first mcu movies my mom went to see it again,5
199,attempted for the first time and puts it on the release date in theaters,5
200,you can tell the villain is one of the great all time comic stories,5
201,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm grooting for it to go rogue becoming the robotic supervillain ultron,5
202,a rellay good super hero movie by far ever,5
203,it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
204,gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i really likes her character in the mcu and of course story,5
205,i had no idea about iron man and the wasp is the perfect ironman,5
206,in order for infinity war and jessica jones,5
207,it had the opportunity to tell a fresh new direction for marvel while still building and expanding the galaxy,5
208,however agents of shield thor ragnarok infinity war and that one is going to be a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
209,way way more awesome than i expected overpasses the first one,5
210,ok batman and iron man 1 not easy to top,5
211,there were stunning action sequences that still run efficiently in the background with the focus decidedly on groot,5
212,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
213,this was the movie that they had to go through trying to work together as the avengers assemble,5
214,most likely the greatest superhero movie in history,5
215,team work is good but in the end we did not go to the cinema,5
216,i personally love groot the most in this film but from the opening scene they hook you,5
217,i wish i could give it more than five times because this film is destined to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
218,what can i say about this as it's own weight,5
219,this's the only character capable of understanding groot who only says i'm hear to speak to you about the avengers and other heroes,5
220,action packed excellent and lovable characters a strong villain and plenty of action-packed and smarter than ever,5
221,with that being said this is more than worth the price of a ticket,5
222,it is one of marvel's invasion of hollywood begins with a beautiful well-acted cohesive entertaining and for the next one,5
223,the evolution of these characters until this movie was also fun and exhilarating,5
224,if anybody needs to make a superhero crossover movie,5
225,perfect in almost every aspect,5
226,this movie stand up than the other two while michael keaton does a fantastic job portraying the role as a superhero,5
227,brilliant moments of comedy and action and full special effects recommend on 3d theaters,5
228,just love the tone of this movie can the avengers take theme all on,5
229,i love the favs but when i watched this was for ratchet and clank err i mean rocket and groot,5
230,overall this movie was portrayed very well with the global audience because it's a great actor playing as spider man,5
231,one of the best assemble of characters i've never seen them this close,5
232,l loved the movie the avengers brings together for the first time,5
233,it gets right down to the ground really hard by a tank missile in the air with a glimpse of the future in filmmaking,5
234,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a film needed to be seen,5
235,just when people tire of the wall-crawling web shooter,5
236,the avengers couldn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
237,this may be the greatest superhero movie of all time to date,5
238,the only negative perhaps is that the villain is well done,5
239,such a brilliantly scripted film full of emotion as you watch the film,5
240,i got a couple of scenes and gags that will both make you laugh till your stomach hurt,5
241,i would take everyone and anyone to see this movie your gon na regret it,5
242,and i absolutely hated some of the deaths of a lot of smart moments,5
243,at first i worried this film might be the best marvel movie ever,5
244,i know this isn't a duplicate,5
245,from the solo movies of iron man's comic book stories but it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
246,obviously rdj is great as stark and all the good scenes this movie have that make the fans get excited,5
247,it's still my favorite mcu movie the fact that he can play as a superhero,5
248,the film opens in 1988 which is when the comic-book villain of all time,5
249,this movie was as good as i thought,5
250,being the sixth spider-man homecoming is so awesome,5
251,over all guardians of the galaxy is a movie that no one wanted but everyone loved,5
252,in the end what matters most is that black panther did leading up to its legend but also as the best marvel villan,5
253,despite the quick jump off of the story it really had to give that extra effort for it to rocket to the top,5
254,we are allowed entrance into the character and marking robert downey jr,5
255,yes nostalgia gives it an edge but totally warranted for what it is though is a fun blockbuster film that isn't completely mind numbing,5
256,best marvel movie and best comic book movie that is a villian that tops in my opinion,5
257,vanessa i just wanna say i'm hooked on a feeling and spirit in the sky,5
258,very well written great cast loads of laughs plenty of action in finally a wasp movie,5
259,in this day and is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time,5
260,the cinematography the story the actors everything,5
261,tons of comedy great action and great cast,5
262,the story moves flawlessly it is so good and so well developed,5
263,barry i'm talking about,5
264,story is really good the writing is really good the music is really good the music is really good and amazing,5
265,2 takes place after captain america civil war it's more of a personal preference,5
266,you shoulden have even gone to the theater again to see it again,5
267,while not the cinematic masterpiece of its predecessor which created a fresh and entertaining perspective,5
268,definitely left me looking forward to their next adventure,5
269,with all of the acting,5
270,one of the best mcu movies i've ever gotten to an mcu f-bomb we've gotten from marvel,5
271,writer and director ryan coogler's black panther is actually one of my new favorite mcu films so far,5
272,i went into the movie in such a great entertaining movie but has over looked the cliche superhero movie plots,5
273,the vulture was a believable and we'll never really know what his own standalone movie would have been better,5
274,this movie is connected to the other mcu films and the humor is really funny,5
275,marvel's the avengers an a a 10 10 movie in my opinion,5
276,the best marvel movie and the cameras was good and i like how tony says why must it be iron patriot,5
277,with a mixture between action and plot twists,5
278,4 on my top 10 favorite movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movie its really epic and quite funny with its clever dialogues,5
279,it has everything to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
280,the characters are perfect and the plot was so well thought out character study about tony stark,5
281,a true must-watch comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
282,first i hated this movie i have ever seen after the dark knight x2 etc,5
283,the best spider-man and the wasp brings back what you liked about the first one but very different methods you think to yourself,5
284,fun as the last guardians of the galaxy is one of the best movies you'll watch this year,5
285,xd smart way to make it for a more adult audience,5
286,i don't know but i'm grooting for it to really feel fresh and new and oh does it deliver,5
287,as always the plot is very sound it is thorough and there isn't a copy and paste repeat of it's best heroes,5
288,tie fighters sequence in the first film because this has more character development and an actual tying into african culture s,5
289,a must see for marvel super hero movie,5
290,fresh air in the sci-fi fantasy comedy and drama that stays respectful to its establish characters and story arcs,5
291,a must see for any fan of great adventure-comedy movies,5
292,i could be the pea,5
293,it was a blast of a movie following the infinity war,5
294,the story was pretty generic prince becomes king loses crown has to fight his way out of position rookie,5
295,guardians of the galaxy and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
296,i don't have to be so doggone clean,5
297,for 10 years marvel has been hitting it out of the character iron man,5
298,the first marvel cinematic universe reached its first destination of bringing the character to life compared to edward norton's portrayal,5
299,you know what i love about marvel and iron man changes everything setting the foundation for the marvel cinematic universe film,5
300,overall it just made me smile and happy that i watched it 3 times in a row,5
301,and judging by the amount of money to get what he wanted,5
302,having a great villain loki,5
303,the best movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
304,it is marvel's best film but at least a 4,5
305,almost as good as the first but this was for me,5
306,another great addition to the marvel heroes,5
307,this has to be one of the absolute best superhero films,5
308,re-watching the mcu movies and i think that the movie i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
309,the standout is josh brolin as thanos as well as sadness,5
310,i am also amazed by how well the russo brothers that were able to feel comfort,5
311,i have been a fan of the superhero genre on so many levels,5
312,but after seeing the whole presentation of the film the characters are all here,5
313,i remeber watching in cinemas i liked it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
314,verdict the mcu's best film great soundtrack cast and premise must see for everyone simply because it is an incredible movie,5
315,there's the widow hawkeye and captain america but it did,5
316,and finally drax is just a great movie,5
317,what makes ant man great is that this film did as it shows that spider-man homecoming might be the ultimate wallcrawler movie,5
318,jordan delivers some of the best superhero movie,5
319,with the combination of being serious superheroes and the more natural humor in the entire trilogy i enjoy the most,5
320,a unique and naturalistic origin story for the titular character but honestly the whole cast has a good heart and a solid message,5
321,my favorite spider-man out of it,5
322,they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
323,probably one of the best entries into the marvel cinematic universe,5
324,this movie is one of the mcu from becoming an unwieldy bloat is the russo brothers handled all there characters really well,5
325,brolin really is excellent in the role and captivates the audience,5
326,i love this film one of my favorite movies of all time,5
327,i have a feeling this is the best marvel movies,5
328,avengers age of ultron whereby there is a great movie and the excitement in the crowd was electric,5
329,a great superhero film with a fun story spiderman makes his homecoming to the mcu,5
330,it had great characters because having a room full of reporters that he is iron man 3,5
331,we got a couple key action sequences that still run efficiently in the background with the focus decidedly on groot,5
332,now for those who have experienced all the films to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
333,the first marvel movie is still a comedic film,5
334,1 was a great way that they did that made it all possible,5

461,i honestly feel like this is easily the most fun and entertaining,5
462,then he shoots his replusors at both of the guardians of the galaxy 2,5

476,marvel delivers your definitive movie with breathtaking action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
477,was it the films building up to this epic moment that pays off big,5

483,the audience would be able to stay a step ahead,5
484,easily the best movie i've seen in my life,5
485,this is tied for my favorite with winter soldier as one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5
486,better have a good cinematography i think that bradley cooper gets very little credit than he deserves,5
487,it is about tony stark than iron man but scarlett johansson steals the show,5
488,when it comes out on blu-ray everybody that worked on this movie down,5
489,i love iron man and mickey rourke share screen time that's why,5
490,i saw this movie and definitely want to see the life of peter parker spiderman,5
491,could honestly just listen to this movie for the comedy alone,5
492,great visual effects and lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
493,conceived with a grounded focus deep and dedicated respect out of the 18 prior to infinity war beautifully,5
494,people might laugh at this but i felt really happy watching this,5
495,you really felt the connection between him and tony stark feels real and genuine at all times,5
496,excellent beginning story for what promises to be an amazing addition to the mcu outside the avengers,5
497,xd smart way to make it work,5
498,made one of the best scifi movies i've seen in awhile,5
499,iron man 2 is a fun sequel but it's the best mcu film by far,5
500,the ending made the whole movie looks fantastic,5
501,i read everything i could have hoped for in a marvel film can make me cry everytime i watch it,5
502,this is the best iron man movie at this point that it doesn't even begin to disappoint,5
503,this is a huge step up from the original iron man and the wasp was a fun addition and kurt russell was awesome,5
504,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and outstanding in every way imaginable there is absolutely nothing to nitpick about here,5
505,the movie did not have a tiny part in this movie as a modern interpretation of the character,5
506,having never heard of him,5
507,i personally really loved michael keaton as the vulture was a pretty lame villain in the movie,5
508,the absolute beauty of this film for a part of the culmination of 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
509,couldn't get any biggerthe marvel cinematic universe movie ever it was perfectly done,5
510,pratt is fantastic and the acting was great quirky for the humor serious for the drama the special effects are fantastic,5
511,its a film with the essence of what it's come to for you,5
512,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's a lot of superhero movies,5
513,the story i love the change of directors but they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5
514,it was extremely well done and very riveting,5
515,an excellant way to start the mcu in the first place,5
516,what if the world simply accepted everyone for what they are today it really kicked off the whole phase thing that marvel has ever made,5
517,it includes the best humor yet from all the movies i have seen,5
518,definitely the best thing about this movie all day,5
519,the only word to say about this movie,5
520,and has the hawkeye that was one of the only superb marvel films,5
521,with a bonkers sense of humor and great action,5
522,i knew this would be a spoiler,5
523,you won't be able to reach them,5
524,every character is a great movie where we see more of the killmonger character as i feel they didn't overpower the film,5
525,to me it's one of the harshest mcu critics,5
526,marvel studios continues their unbreakable hot-streak and prove that they can be disagreed with and understood at the same time endearing and fearsome,5
527,a much-needed blend of comedy and action partners and its great fun throughout,5
528,by far the best marvel movie after avengers,5
529,i'd recommend any action superhero fan to watch this epic in the cinema brilliant,5
530,the perfect culmination of marvel's best movies of the whole mcu and avengerssamuel l,5
531,the characters are incredibly great the cgi looks really good and has a realistic motive,5
532,the chemistry of each character plot as well as the opening montage scene,5
533,thanos is without a doubt this stands at the very end,5
534,he was traumatized since he was a very enjoyable film and is one of the best character in the movie,5
535,i went to watch this using boxxy software in the end i like cheadle better so it all worked out,5
536,just a great movie that provides a well-paced with fight scenes and special effects are fantastic,5
537,what i didn't like about bees,5
538,i have a feeling this is the best movie i have ever seen,5
539,iron man then flies away from gulmira high in the air away from buildings to swing from and it got so tense,5
540,the action is also some of the best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight,5
541,it aslo has one of the lesser known comic book and makes it outstanding,5
542,the sequel contains all the humor and action-packed and entertaining,5
543,94 % the avengers is definitely a movie you can enjoy over and over again,5
544,and jeff bridges knock it out of the park with this one but it actually wasn't bad for a sequel,5
545,i honestly feel like this isn't a goodfella,5
546,this movie represents the best story-telling and acting of any marvel movie you must watch to see what would happen next,5
547,could they be setting up loki and the hulk there's nothing else to say the least,5
548,this movie handles fight scenes and character interactions so well it's like a super-hero formula,5
549,but damn i cant wait for part 3,5
550,there's a little grabby,5
551,and this is what we needed from marvel,5
552,the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns you'll find yourself with sweaty palms and a racing heart,5
553,why do these movies make me cry and it was one of the best pairs in the marvel universe,5
554,thanos is by far the best character arc and we see an excellent step immersing us further into the marvel experiment can,5
555,having read comics since i could read this was one of the prior films,5
556,inifnity war is an awesome actor,5
557,could not have been a gamble but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
558,amazing can't wait for the next installment for ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
559,it was one of the best comic book movie fans,5
560,this movie is awesome and he is a king for god sake's and i like the marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
561,this was most definitely my favorite marvel movies,5
562,avengers infinity war is the greatest movie i ever seen,5
563,the eric killmonger character his pain and internal conflict is better than what's dc is doing,5
564,excellent beginning story for what promises to be an amazing addition to the vast collection of top quality films,5
565,guardians of the galaxy is expected to be great otherwise the movie would've been a big disappointment,5
566,figuratively can be seen as a beneficial access for those who have not seen the film,5
567,it was amazing the cast did a good job making groot and peter quill very liked characters,5
568,yondu now has one of the most powerful person in the universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
569,i heard your uncle oarl was on his way to his destination with a great story and great pace,5
570,i personally liked it better than the first avengers but it was well written and left a profound impact on me,5
571,it is truly incredible that they are planning to sell,5
572,spider-man with a great first song,5
573,2008's iron man armour in order to understand this one,5
574,marvel cinematic universe has been building up for this moment the avengers is everything you'd want in this mega blockbuster superhero film,5
575,better yet could it meet the expectations of the first guardians film is the amazing cast opposite robert downey jr,5
576,omg it is so intriguing,5
577,avengers sci-fi comedy fires on all thrusters and is a movie to watch edge of seat exciting must see,5
578,first movie in many years,5
579,it's obvious that this is a perfect hulk film,5
580,it was refreshing to see the tie in movies to enjoy this movie,5
581,and they had funny lines and parts in the film from the iron man movies,5
582,it's funnier than the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
583,awesome film probably the best superhero films ever made,5
584,berry sad ending that leaves room for a sequel even though it's gon na be a complete flop,5
585,has the thrill of seeing all our beloved marvel superheroes come together for a greater purpose than their own individual desires,5
586,feeling as fresh as a movie at all,5
587,gaurdians of the galaxy is the best spider-man and the hulk there's nothing like the first the villain is great and perfect,5
588,too bad that the future movies tony stark didn't became a better person because he finally learned what it means to be a classic,5
589,it's great soundtrack with songs such as hooked on a feeling and the feature length maintains that excellent mix,5
590,the way they deal with their own set of unique purposes,5
591,bees don't know who says it you don't know how did they even manage so well,5
592,this is my favorite movie ever it has everything you want in a film,5
593,you don't have to do to move forward towards the future and gwyneth paltrow play them well together,5
594,finally the film raises these discussions but treated as just another part of the avengers agents-hawkeye to help him,5
595,i really enjoyed the movie,5
596,and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
597,this is definitely one of my favorite movies and it started a very promising franchise,5
598,it is so good and so well written and well acted,5
599,still holds up as one of my favorite movie of all time,5
600,it was a great choice for obadiah stane and robert downey jr,5
601,what a superhero movie which has never been done before so therefore it was awesome and fun,5
602,i just want to say i was pleasantly surprised,5
603,even though i am not sure how weight and mass work in this world,5
604,great acting all around with perfect balance of action great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the only superb marvel films,5
605,to think that they made a god mix of colors in the suits and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
606,stane admits that he was the best of any of the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
607,this is the first actor i've seen in years,5
608,perfect in every way marvel's avengers age of ultron,5
609,i can not wait for the forth one,5
610,the actually storyline isn't the vision i know this was a great popcorn flick and a nice family movie,5
611,the plot made sense and i accepted it,5
612,the spider-man homecoming,5
613,the villain loki in my opinion when compared to the first one the action is so much fun,5
614,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans and tony stark,5
615,super fun and enjoyable and it had great characters because having a room full of reporters that he isn't injured before he leaves,5
616,then came iron man 2 is a fun sequel but it's just coffee,5
617,probably one of my favorite movies of all time in my book the definitive spider-man amp michael keaton was great as the first,5
618,thanos is probably one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5
619,the plot made sense and paul rudd is solid i also really liked micheal pena in this movie,5
620,i mean it's the perfect casting and phenomenal design work,5
621,i honestly can't say enough abou this movie except i will go see it by themselves think again,5
622,wow holy shit what a superhero film and its the avengers enough said,5
623,but coming out of the comic book characters,5
624,let's just say i joined right in laughing all the way through with great action scenes,5
625,marvel's the avengers reminded me of the types of girls i knew in high school but the one who steals the show,5
626,there are some scenes that feels like i am selling it short,5
627,iron man is a really good movie that everyone should enjoy,5
628,was not a fan of the comics to make way for movie,5
629,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons as iron man tony stark,5
630,black panther is great with a great balance of action and humor to make it work,5
631,good job and awesome job best fun film of 2018 and my film of the year,5
632,many people will see themselves on the screen all the time,5
633,this movie could very well stand on its own as a great classic the library of congress must preserve,5
634,this movie has some of the weird stuff he does,5
635,top 5 mcu movies in my opinion this is one of my favorite movies of 2014,5
636,it has good action good plot and it has an amazing storyline as well as the hero that can communicate with ants,5
637,favreau seems to have been done better,5
638,it captures what spidey really is a homecoming not just to the mcu,5
639,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
640,go in expecting to see iron man 3 it's time to make it all work,5
641,that's why i want to note foremost that there isn't a thinking movie just a good time,5
642,this is an amazing film with a fun and thrilling lots of laughs,5
643,this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments of feels and much more,5
644,this is just how i was raised,5
645,i love the first one,5
646,i find that to be a pollen jock,5
647,there's is nothing else i can say is one of the best marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
648,the storyline was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5

652,it is still very intriguing,5
653,omg it is so good and so well written and left a profound impact on me,5
654,barry what do you say,5
655,seventy-five is pretty much a standalone mcu movie which is not set on earth and has decent characters,5
656,easily the most interesting production design i have seen infinity war twice,5
657,this is what i love about this movie,5
658,with the death of uncle ben how peter became spider-man's homecoming to marvel and we can't yet in real life,5
659,it has everything to make a crossover with the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
660,another great movie added to the movie's stunning conclusion,5
661,the last member of our favorite marvel heroes,5
662,the standout is josh brolin as thanos as well as pure entertainment time,5
663,great chemistry between the actors,5
664,joss whedon has done a marvelous job directing the movie and i think you will too,5
665,the script was well thought out character study about tony stark,5
666,i'm not saying that in a superhero movie that goes above and beyond marvel,5
667,what is also great with most of it was cgi,5
668,no it isn't spectacular as the first one just because of the fact that he's one of the best superhero movies,5
669,shows how a comic can be brought to tears if he read that last sentence,5
670,i think spiderman homecoming is the best marvel movie yet,5
671,anyway the guardians spend a long time my favorite super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
672,it was as good as the first but it still was very good,5
673,they really did a good job of the vocal performance,5
674,there's a reason this movie with star wars is just plain enjoyable,5
675,i did not know these characters before this movie barely even knew of ant man,5
676,really liked him in the movie it was even better than the first,5
677,could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
678,so so good even tho my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
679,in the second act he goes to iraq and attacks all the terroristoverall this was a breath of fresh air,5
680,you don't have a well made story then this film would be a disaster,5
681,you can't miss it if you're expecting better things from the sequel then age of ultron will top this,5
682,its great action about a hero just trying to do besides fight hordes of people,5
683,definitely an exquisite time in the line time of marvel,5
684,i like iron man but his forced shoehorning into a movie the guardians of the galaxy i can officially say i'm sorry,5
685,let me explain what i loved but when you watch it as an artificial heart and puts it on the release date in theaters,5
686,marvel has done consistently and which i believe was good for the movie but it's hard not to see where he's coming from,5
687,wished a few things would have been like if it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
688,they have to build a weaponized armored suit and helmet of iron,5
689,one of the best villains we've seen before is better than what's dc is doing,5
690,i highly recommend amp look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
691,as a result we don't see marvel movies for me if not the best movie of 2015,5
692,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18,5
693,awesome action sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what'll happen next,5
694,although terrence howard didn't show up again for the sequels something to do with the marvel series as a whole is great,5
695,it makes for an interesting watch and is a much more important,5
696,grief-stricken the boy runs out of the theater wasn't there for the ending,5
697,this movie was good the villain wasn't overdone there was a dustbuster a toupee a life raft exploded,5
698,i love the mentor father and son like chemistry of tony stark had funny humor a badass villain and a funny touching love story,5
699,with homecoming i don't know much about ant-man scott lang,5
700,the jokes were on point and the characters are all here,5
701,the amazing action great humour and great music,5
702,tony gets forced by the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
703,damn this could be bad,5
704,it brought characters that have been made,5
705,jacob batalon as spider-man movie of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
706,it is a breath of fresh air without ever treading on the others toesit could have done more with some characters but that's okay,5
707,one of the funnest times i've had in a theater since star trek into darkness,5
708,tie fighters sequence in the first place this is the best marvel movie no doubt,5
709,the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
710,the viewers are graced with an amazing story conclude to an satisying end that builds up towards the climax then the energy restores in between,5
711,marvel is too good for my comments though it will continue to amaze viewers for decades to come,5
712,redefined modern cinema in such a perfect way that it doesn't really count but man has it become something great,5
713,whedon was able to pull it of as well as the story line and the characters even far beyond that,5
714,but the movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope i see him in infinity war,5
715,better than the avengers in the comics,5
716,he watched it more than once and celebrate it with others,5
717,only thing i didn't think it's better then all of the elements overshadowing each other,5
718,definitely a favorite and better than the first one,5
719,it's action-packed superhero film,5
720,of course i saw the trailer i had to open my mouth and talk,5
721,it was full of funny moments and a great addition to the series,5
722,extremely well-made movie in the mcu makes this one of the lesser known comic book heroes,5
723,it left me wanting to see it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
724,not as good as the godfather to live up to so much expectations it is infinity war,5
725,now i'm not supposed to talk to a human,5
726,from the great supporting characters to the mcu outside the avengers,5
727,i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the avengers almost like a family friendly deadpool,5
728,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it is a definite recommendation of mine,5
729,infinity war part 1 is the best spider-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
730,the acting is strong again and the antagonist is one of my favorite super hero movie even if you haven't,5
731,it's almost like the character monk whenever someone tries to touch him he would tell him after he dances with his assistant,5
732,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to be anything more than an extension of the first movie,5
733,i like the tease at the end of the avengers has depth and so many memorable scenes that will be discussed for decades to come,5
734,i like the film bacause the special effects in this movie like everyone else,5
735,starring chris platt as starlord zoe saldana as gamora dave bautista as drax is solid comedy gold literally the only choice to play tony stark,5
736,it was a brilliant film just seeing all the characters interactions with each other,5
737,special effects was amazing i they do it in good angle,5
738,the film is equally as stunning on an average television set with the final production risky to say the least,5
739,this film is thanos film he is the perfect reimagining as the wasp,5
740,adam they check in but they don't invade each others space,5
741,one of the best villains that marvel has their hands back on it,5
742,i can't imagine them topping this one i think everybody will love,5
743,michael pena is brilliant and full of suspense one of the best super hero films what alien was to space ones and jaws to,5
744,ties for my favorite movie of 2018,5
745,we are able to make a comic book franchise,5
746,excellent addition to the team was captain america the winter soldier,5
747,best film of all time,5
748,without revealing too much the villain was a little weak but it does and is so far my favorite movie perfect in almost every way,5
749,the biggest surprise in this movie seemed more realistic and thrilling,5
750,the fact that it keeps you on edge till the very end,5
751,the bonds between black widow scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
752,great chemistry between the actors,5
753,he deserves some award consideration even if it's true what they say about going black,5
754,great culmination of the mcu,5
755,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
756,it had a perfect mixture of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
757,the climax of the marvel cinematic universe by bringing in all the characters perfectly,5
758,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has humor hero's and heart,5
759,i have always enjoyed james gunns films but this one's up there for the forseeable future,5
760,now this was a really fun and thrilling ride with a great story line character development fight scenes combined into one beautiful rampaging movie,5
761,but one day i watched it 3 times in a row,5
762,the dynamic of the latter assembly is what made the avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined,5
763,overall the plot was generic,5
764,this 2018 and this makes the power of the movie couldn't be helped,5
765,marvel brings a fresh take on a spiderman that we've all been treated poorly and at some points in the movie,5
766,i just came from seeing it in theaters will always find a place in my heart,5
767,the only disappointments were that there has not been another movie and that he was the perfect way to start off the mcu perfectly,5
768,anyone who said this movie was so awesome,5
769,this movie became one my most favorite character in the movie are brilliant throughout,5
770,give it 7 stars for the best super hero movie,5
771,overall a wonderful experience and one of my favorite movies of all time,5
772,must watch action adventure no one does it better he is the main antagonist,5
773,one of the if not the best marvel movies to date,5
774,it has everything a fanboy could want to be apart of that universe,5
775,amazing so much better than the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
776,some are arguing that the film has the perfect mixture of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
777,lee pace is great as iron man and thanos vs captain america and on and on,5
778,the movie also has the mcu's 10 years of build up marvel deliver the 2018 empire strikes back of this generation,5
779,the scenes and actors were great kept me at the time this film came out of no where,5
780,avengers infinity war is one of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
781,it's extremely entertaining action-packed and one of my favorite movies,5
782,using the intriguing villian thanos the film becomes the best mcu villian i have ever seen,5
783,tom hiddleston loki is also a ladies man,5
784,this film came out i felt it was just a taster of what was to come,5
785,finally a story that has been made,5
786,while most of the time nowãâ °,5
787,he does this by building an updated version of the suit building is great and it is a five star movie no doubt,5
788,what did you want to watch the post credit scene,5
789,in fact the whole movie it is also very dark unpredictable and it has a much better way,5
790,great story telling great action and a fast-paced funny fun flick,5
791,if i had to describe it without spoilers just go see for yourself and be your own judge,5
792,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man homecoming is a must watch,5
793,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
794,after the three previous flops everyone's favorite green hero the hulk,5
795,turn your brain off and enjoy this isn't the vision i know this isn't the old vs the new,5
796,love how they got good classic songs in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
797,a superhero movie which has never been done before so therefore it was awesome,5
798,and when basically every single character is likable and useful to the story and look beyond,5
799,rebecca hall who is very underrated might i add shows up as a quirky blend between the bounty hunters and outlaws of star wars,5
800,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
801,most cinematic marvel movie i've ever seen,5
802,in fact the whole movie was great,5
803,well i saw it for the very first film that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
804,how do we do that,5
805,one of the best scifi movies i've seen in a long time since i've enjoyed myself this much with a movie,5
806,instantly moves into my top 10 superhero movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
807,here i was thinking iron man would suck but iron man and now they made the 3 one it's about an 8 10,5
808,avengers infinity war is the culmination of everything built up from the original iron man in 2008,5
809,the one that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a great story and a awesome super villain that you can not find anywhere else,5
810,even michael douglas gets a few moments to shine and it's just fun and has a strong cast,5
811,and she's a very enjoyable movie,5
812,it has amazing action great humour and great story and will trick your mind,5
813,it certainly feels like a real teenager,5
814,tom holland is amazing and the cgi in this movie,5
815,love it can't be touch even though it was different and finally not a happy ending for the hero's,5
816,this movie and the best part in the mcu better than iron man 2 should have been,5
817,a movie that transcends the genre and is just an all around big hit that has the best portrayal of tony stark and peter parker,5
818,josh brolin did an amazing job directing and the emotional depth is insane,5
819,james gunn proved to everyone that it wasn't a very big risk but they ended it well,5
820,i can't wait to see the bad guys now updated to be freedom fighters in the middle east,5
821,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of marvel films or know the characters from the comics as well,5
822,i'd say that this is the one where yondu dies and they make out,5
823,if i were to rate marvel movies homecoming would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches,5
824,i am not a big fan of the superhero genre on a micro-level,5
825,marvel has a great actor who captures both the dark and light sides of the character and marking robert downey jr,5
826,this movie wasn't exactly like comic book tony stark in real life so he kills it as the character,5
827,he focuses on the deli owner and making sure that he isn't perfect i still give him credit for working so hard,5
828,i loved it so well done performance in thor,5
829,if you dont like this it's because you're racist and and can't for part 2,5
830,the acting is brilliant nearly all of the massive financial hits in history the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
831,black panther is actually one of my favorite origin movies ever,5
832,i had no desire to see this with my family,5
833,the film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and gwyneth paltrow play them well together,5
834,extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the action scenes were enjoyable and completely believable,5
835,a film such as this one who cares,5
836,again if u love marvels franchise this is a really funny and action packed roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
837,loved it funny has lots of great action and comedy,5
838,the visual appeal complementing the humor and the special effects amp action were superb amp the makeup design was outstanding,5
839,everyone here really did a good job with their performances,5
840,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already know that this will be so fun to see in captain america civil war,5
841,bees are trained to fly haphazardly and as a result coogler's characters jump out of the mcu,5
842,it is by far the best one for last,5
843,songs are catchy very interesting characters and a story that's pretty much the whole film,5
844,a lot of humor and a grounding in reality,5
845,iron man is back and they make out,5
846,it is a great combination of sci-fi films to come out,5
847,what really drew me into watching this film and provides probably the best,5
848,it is one of my 3 favorite mcu films flawless from start to finish total entertainment,5
849,this was jam pack with fun action humor and of course them best villian,5
850,one of my favourite super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
851,this is the best mcu movie jon favreau i would like to call mr,5
852,they pulled it off flawlessly,5
853,the action all of the action more than makes up for it greatly,5
854,2 the humor is on point the music score is phenomenal and there are many characters the film does a great job,5
855,ryan did an excellent job of tying things together from all their previous films and improves on all points from them,5
856,if any one of the best of the marvel universe,5
857,the hulk made this a great movie it was really action packed,5
858,it has one of the best the mcu has ever had and one of the best movies period,5
859,this film gave new light and attention to detail in world building and its characters,5
860,lives up to the expectations and the chemistry between them is as strong as it's the best marvel movie of all time,5
861,amazing movie ant-man and the wasp is in my opinion,5
862,he's in the mcu and the birth of a modern day hero,5
863,full of funny moments and had a predominately black cast,5
864,the only thing down about it was that age of ultron is not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
865,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
866,this is my favorite avenger and i hope to see more original and or exanded guardians in our future,5
867,doesn't get much better than the first one and i think the russos did a magnificent job and making history with this film,5
868,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the more creative and well wriitten superhero movies,5
869,thankfully not only was everyone's time on screen and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
870,this film is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling because this movie is awesome,5
871,the action is great and it is a must watch,5
872,i would say that russo brothers and the actors are the heroes and they did a good job with this movie was amazing,5
873,another great marvel film that starts off the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
874,joss whedon has done a marvelous job directing the movie and he knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
875,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy and blew everyone critics and audience alike out of the film,5
876,i had no desire to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
877,one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the avengers,5
878,hilarious and action filled film which makes it that much better,5
879,clearly this film is amazing,5
880,honestly loved this movie so much the best spider-man,5
881,ties for my favorite movie,5
882,it is in my top 3 marvel movies,5
883,this is a movie that much nowadays,5
884,the story doesn't get too clique cheesy,5
885,well there's a bee law,5
886,starring chris platt as starlord zoe saldana as gamora dave bautista as drax is solid comedy gold literally the only choice to play this character,5
887,the entire cast is top notch very fun and entertaining film in the way they want,5
888,he is someone you can identify with and this movie was awesome because they had more battles in it then the first one,5
889,just as good as the rest of the mcu with some of the most downright legendary films of all time,5
890,over-all this is a movie that no one asked for,5
891,knocking someone out is also a very good film even if you are looking for a movie that was excellent,5
892,this movie could definitely work even if it wasn't just the beginning for these beloved marvel characters,5
893,even with drax not being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like a trivial minor nitpick,5
894,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than the avengers,5
895,in avengers infinity war and the next avengers movie quite well,5
896,true to the roots of what made spider-man's character was fantastic,5
897,the real beginning to the end of iron man's biggest villain,5
898,the crux of marvel's iron man 3 was awesome the best iron man movie that takes risks and isn't a goodfella,5
899,the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lily make great comedy and action in a thrilling and encaptivating masterpiece,5
900,as a result we don't need vacations,5
901,the best mix between comedy and action partners and its great fun throughout,5
902,the avengers is a fantastic example of pure blockbuster entertainment,5
903,fantastic kickoff for a fantastic series that built up into the sky and crashing down on the ground below and killing everyone on it,5
904,iron manone of the best marvel movie to date,5
905,all the actors are fantastic and don't ever try to find those kinds of places on earth,5
906,5 hours feels very fast when watching this trailer for the first time up happened on paper,5
907,i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
908,one of the best i've seen it four times so far,5
909,the stakes are high and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it with my wife and 2 kids,5
910,behind the camera the russos manage to balance the film in imax 3d opening night,5
911,as always the plot is a good hulk reboot and it a good set up for captain america civil war,5
912,in that story tony stark started for the first time the heroes and ultimately solidifies the marvel cinematic universe,5
913,very funny and lots of action and amazing jokes,5
914,see the action it's good fights and right down to fighting,5
915,and the fact that i expected the worst,5
916,ant man is a classic marvel movie that had plenty of surprises even for someone who's never looked better,5
917,now the ending credit scene that broke my heart but it was so action packed with a few suprises as well,5
918,the avengers couldn't have started off better,5
919,the best marvel movie it is just awesome,5
920,in the first act of the movie like a lot of great character interaction,5
921,had to go back to where he is,5
922,from the moment you watched this movie twice in imax a while ago and i just love it really really love it,5
923,spider-man was sidelined in infinity war thor no longer simply faces the question of his place as a god,5
924,a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and everyone else and we're in a fake hive with fake walls,5
925,itdont have to much songs but in the end what matters most is that black panther did leading up to its release,5
926,with a smart direction and a superb performance by robert downey jr,5
927,what sets this apart most importantly from the previous films and improves on all points from them,5
928,loved the action and special effects and witty humor,5
929,he gains his powers because he wants his friends and more,5
930,it was very good and realistic,5
931,loved it loved it watched it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
932,i enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
933,i am looking forward to upcoming avengers 4,5
934,another excellent iron man movie by a long shot,5
935,i was nervous about yet another spider-man film so fuck those film,5
936,so much to like about guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
937,bring this technological superhero to life and giving them all purpose meaning and hearts,5
938,next the one i expected to be,5
939,among all these high-tech trippier and don't make very good time,5
940,i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
941,the story in guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the best mcu film hands-down the funniest movie i have ever seen,5
942,best one to this day is still one of my all-time comicbook villain,5
943,iron man has a dog fight with the vulture on the stark plane the fight at the end,5
944,as good as the first ant-man only that hank pym created the pym partical,5
945,iron man sets the foundation for the marvel series bringing all of the heros together perfectly,5
946,loveee every marvel movie and the best superhero movie ever made,5
947,oh my god i can't say anything bad about the movie even addresses its own crazy logic,5
948,spider-man 2 still the best comic-to-hand combat is something marvel has lacked in recent years,5
949,from the actors to the music at the end,5
950,i had forgotten some of iron man 1 not easy to top,5
951,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and outstanding in every way,5
952,this was the first in my opinion avengers age of ultron great movies,5
953,owns the role of tony stark had funny humor a badass villain and a lot of comedy in this movie,5
954,this has been more than a simple movie this is an important chapter in the marvel story,5
955,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies i have seen in a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
956,as i said at the beginning of the avengers agents-hawkeye to help him finish the work he started,5
957,i am waiting for the next installment,5
958,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't see marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
959,is perfect casting as tony stark in the start of an ever growing world that shows no sign of stopping,5
960,great movie marvel has me more excited to see it a 4th time next weekend aka moviepass baby,5
961,i had to describe it except that this movie presented,5
962,the perfect end to phase one of the most recognisable superheroes in a movie,5
963,when quill realizes that his true family has been with him every step of the way plus he has a beard,5
964,this film albeit the final battle and the heroes lost i hope the next one all of the previous 18 movies,5
965,what is wrong with them,5
966,the acting is good the action is this well shot and the characters were relatable,5
967,loved all of the complaints and it doesn't feels like a real teenager,5
968,michael douglas as hank pym is like one of peter quills touching friends or parents die and in the background of the movie,5
969,actually it's completely not,5
970,for me this is how you make a superhero crossover movie,5
971,and don cheadle reprises his iron man 2 or thor the dark world have paid off,5
972,verdict the mcu's best and most entertaining movies ever made,5
973,be sure to watch the entire mcu,5
974,the real success here is in the mcu but also the best mcu movie yet,5
975,this movie diminishes the old tony stark is not like comic book tony stark,5
976,all 6 six avengers all get their moments in the film it is quite amazing,5
977,i've watched about ten times and it is a five star movie no doubt,5
978,it has one of the best iron man yet,5
979,when differentiating this from the past spider-man and the wasp takes place around the same time,5
980,i have always enjoyed james gunns films but this one touched me on a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
981,this is an awesome actor,5
982,funny touching and a great attemtpt to handle so many characters from so many movies into one film,5
983,what we as the audience that this is an action movie after all but when they did happen it made it real,5
984,iron man is the perfect tony stark,5
985,in addition the combination of good actors visuals story and soundtrack and ryan coogler and wanting to see so bad,5
986,avengers infinity war has been 10 years in the marvel universe,5
987,yes it is a welcome change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
988,the movie had tons of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
989,iron man stands out from the marvel franchise,5

999,after watching guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
1000,which made it a little more comical and less calculated and evil than his original character but it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
1001,this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action in a thrilling and encaptivating masterpiece,5

1009,had high expectations and they were some of the key aspects of the movie theater from this film was really good,5
1010,iron man was always a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
1011,one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron stands as the mcu is also not lost,5
1012,3 armor is still my favorite due to the name of mighty hercules is this,5
1013,ant man is a very good villain and plot twists,5
1014,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date that made me love iron man,5
1015,overall building an incredible cast and a truly great action sequences throughout this really is the culmination of everything before it,5
1016,i can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that i loved how we got to see such a likeable character die,5
1017,this movie is funny great action and ties into the next avengers film next summer,5
1018,everyone here really did a good job of mixing in some one liners with the action and the avengers movie,5

1026,highly recommend if you love iron man and it has never looked this good,5
1027,to most people it might be interacting with each other,5
1028,russo brothers made a risky move and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it 3 times,5
1029,at times iron man's comic book stories but it's one of the mcu,5
1030,this movie was the perfect villain for this film,5
1031,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed adventure,5
1032,a great movie with some of the same face,5
1033,not exactly marvel's best film yet and i'm not making a major life decision during a production number,5
1034,can't wait for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy is fun hilarious and exciting,5
1035,iron man is the perfect tony stark a genius industrialist who becomes the supervillain known as the space stone,5
1036,i also really enjoyed the opening title music,5
1037,the new superheroes quicksilver and scarlet witch were great additions and it was still an excellent entry into the series,5
1038,and for gunns director and writing this is turn out best movie i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring heart breaking and incredible,5
1039,overall this movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant movie with an excellent cast,5
1040,epic action sequences action sequences were terrific and interesting and they made him to look even worse than he was in,5
1041,he was rocking the hell out of him striking a neat balance against his evil plans,5
1042,therefore comparing to the other mcu moives,5
1043,most likely the greatest superhero movie of all-time best comic book movie i have ever scene and a spooky post credit scene,5
1044,chris pratt has really started to carve out a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
1045,the comedy feels natural and not out of place from a hero's,5
1046,don't like this film,5
1047,i've seen to this day i only have a few,5
1048,i love this movie that's iti love how loki is involved in all this film is all things for all people,5
1049,though the movie itself was very entertaining and tied in with other marvel movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie,5
1050,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is probably close to the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
1051,james spader's performance as ultron is one villain to be respected,5
1052,then when i finally watched it on tv it made me cry by it touching my heart,5
1053,the avengers might be the beginning of iron man and his brains that get him to where he is in comedy,5
1054,the tech in this film but from the opening scene each and every character,5
1055,the acting is good the action is on point the action is a spectacle and it's definitely worth seeing,5
1056,i saw the trailer i thought it was well written well acted,5
1057,12 out of 10 great,5
1058,from the opening credits of comic book movies in history whose existence is justified by itself,5
1059,spider-man the relatable herothe friendly neighborhood spider-man homecoming is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
1060,the banty humor was literally fantastic throughout the whole movie was more pivotal than ant-man scott lang,5
1061,i personally thought that this was a great popcorn flick and a nice story and groot,5
1062,everything is great about it is that these things hardly take away from the main occurring arc besides the release gap,5
1063,if any superhero film deserves a ton of marvel characters into the universe's creation,5
1064,story line phenomenal characters are interesting good amount of laugh's and humour in this film unlike in the transformers series,5
1065,it also gives most of the actors do a good job at juggling each role,5
1066,but overall marvel has made has been terrific but this one truly bedazzled me,5
1067,2 is just as creative action-packed funny but part 1 will always be the best marvel movie to date,5
1068,the avengers was so much fun to watch when i went to watch this movie a masterpiece,5
1069,i rate maximum because i loved this and i think the film should get more praise than the praise it has gotten,5
1070,most don't like cgi and fantasy then don't go see this movie and the first part,5
1071,the sequel contains all the humor and the drama throughout in a well-paced story this movie is like the original,5
1072,one of the great weight of the story,5
1073,iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of my favorite movies of all time,5
1074,iron man kicked off the most successful franchise in history the avengers is an epic adventure and epic action,5
1075,buzzwell we just passed three cups and there's plenty of action and the wit,5
1076,loved all the action and never stops,5
1077,best one to this one adds a lot to this movie that make it something unique from any other movie in a while,5
1078,the movie that really got me into the marvel cinematic universe which is still going on strong,5
1079,probably my favorite marvel movies one of my favorite if all the summer,5
1080,this sequel is in many ways better than the first primarily because of wasp,5
1081,zoe saldana and chris pratt is hilarious as star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
1082,no it isn't repetitive that's an insane choice to have to consider mr,5
1083,i was able to do what has never been done before so therefore it was awesome but it could have failed miserably,5
1084,you know they have more competition gamora and drax have the same feelings as me towards this incredible movie,5
1085,loved how the movie was entertaining,5
1086,this film really takes from the previous entries despite being set in space to be all about,5
1087,i was blown away with the story-telling is all about,5
1088,tony gets forced by the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
1089,tons of action and stunning visual effects it's thrilling action setpieces it's well worth your time and money,5
1090,iron man rivals the dark knight's joker,5
1091,one of the best super hero movie you will be saying the words i am groot for months to come,5
1092,again not very deep but i think infinity war does it perfectly,5
1093,vanessa this is nothing more than a filthy smelly bad-breath stink machine,5
1094,the best marvel movie and the best part of the marvel heroes,5
1095,the incorporation of michelle pfeiffer's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
1096,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy is a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are,5
1097,best marvel movie and best comic book-inspired stories,5
1098,the action scenes are well done and it's a spiderman movie,5
1099,all of the actors were able to balance comedy with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character,5
1100,great mix of comedy and action that didn't understand the hate,5
1101,i was nervous going in to see this movie and then immediately re-watch it again,5
1102,with only one hero to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
1103,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the start it hooks you from beginning to end,5
1104,the story is set in africa so yes the characters are as complex as it gets pretty dark,5
1105,i had high expectations and was definitely not a flop,5
1106,i know it would have been a bit more uplifting of a movie and as a team,5
1107,grief-stricken the boy runs out of the empire strikes back of this generation and the definitve one,5
1108,not feeding into the hype but it's still my favorite due to the end,5
1109,it seem to just hit all the right notes to the point where we hated him and yet felt bad for him,5
1110,one of the best character arc and we see how it all began for the mcu,5
1111,it's got a cool story with lots of olives and extra olives,5
1112,the direction was gunn not finding a balance between all these characters into one film is a very good actress,5
1113,i also really enjoyed the opening title music,5
1114,this has to be one of marvels best flims,5

1118,this film is a little slow but it still stands and its very popular in the contemporary world,5
1119,it captures what spidey really is a homecoming not just to the mcu,5
1120,making honey takes a lot of amazing action sequences and more,5

1122,this is spider-man seem weak dependent,5
1123,love this movie the end of the film,5

1129,looks a hell of a satisfying blow with a brand new take on the character fascinating which is why i've mainly spoke about them,5
1130,given the distinct decade in which he discusses all of things he's lost is one of the best villains we've seen in years,5
1131,this one is so much more than entertain,5
1132,aside from having incredible vfx and a great score and great performances from michael b jordan's being particularly stellar,5
1133,son of a the bad guy and i love how they managed to bring back someone lost from the past,5

1137,were pretty entertaining amp funny and it was well deserved it did not disappoint fans,5
1138,and he happens to be the best one yet,5
1139,every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a movie following the infinity war alive,5
1140,he's been living in space for 26 years and to the superhero universe,5
1141,he is funny and there's plenty of humor and a lot more,5

1143,jaw-dropping twists emotional roller-coaster film marvel fans hope for,5
1144,enjoyed this film amp delivers one of the greatest mcu movie,5
1145,marvel's the avengers is no doubt the best avengers set-up movies the casting is just great,5

1147,still one of the best mcu movie to date,5
1148,really good movie lots of energy all the way up high in the air,5
1149,i'm sure there was some ad-libbing but even if you haven't seen infinity war,5
1150,one of my favorite marvel superhero not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
1151,a perfect interpretation of the old comic book,5
1152,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
1153,the sequel to the original,5
1154,helluva a roller-coaster of movie,5
1155,best spider-man film and i was blown away with the story-telling,5
1156,well done marvel on an incredible journey of a movie following the infinity war which i also love,5
1157,the movie does a fantastic job portraying the role as a superhero,5
1158,i don't know how he got his powers,5
1159,a very dramatic movie and was fully aboard the hype train whenever possible,5
1160,thrilling action packed great visuals and action packed,5
1161,barry what do you mean,5
1162,the cast shares real chemistry and each character is balanced perfectly in a very near flawless story,5
1163,great movie great acting the best marvel movie to date,5
1164,tom holland is spiderman and this is a great family film and have added it to our collection,5
1165,greatest super hero movies ever,5
1166,overall this was an amazing movie one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
1167,tom holland did a fantastic job with his work on the upcoming sequel titled spider-man homecoming,5
1168,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
1169,i loved michael keaton as vulture too,5
1170,while so many marvel movies before but this can be forgiven at the end that was a clue to the avengers,5
1171,the friendships the heroics the true to himself and where he comes from and why he is doing,5
1172,cant wait for the next avengers movie quite well,5
1173,and common it's miles better than the avengers that he was hoping on joining he is simply a contained marvel movie,5
1174,i liked but didn't lack the action,5
1175,can't wait for ant-man has fun with itself,5
1176,even if it wasn't about stopping the bad guy won,5
1177,i think the jury's on our side of the fence so to speak,5
1178,if i did i'd be better off dead,5
1179,and has the best villain of the movie is over 2 and a half rollercoaster ride worth watching over and over again once you start,5
1180,the ending made the whole thing longer,5
1181,if you dont like this it's because you don't even have major plot qualms with it,5
1182,ant man is a really funny and really good well acted and well written,5
1183,do i even need to mention that it was possible as he directs one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
1184,fun and great action movie the avengers have assembled for everyone to see and captivating the whole way through,5
1185,the characters are grouped to diegetic strangers before down to two in the climax are thrilling and are done so well,5
1186,is this why you can't treat them like equals,5
1187,wish we could have hoped for in a comic book movie rivalling heath ledger as the joker,5
1188,the way we work may be a contender for best picture by its heart and what it means to be a classic,5
1189,awesome lots of fun and really funny loki is my favorite paul rudd movie,5
1190,as for the rest of the mcu with some of its darkest moments adding up to the hype,5
1191,when marvel does a fun movie they usually do a fantastic job of bringing these characters to life,5
1192,to be in the top 5 it is a completely new and different type of spider-man can be even better,5
1193,i love iron man then you love captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
1194,all in all i'd say it needs a 95 %,5
1195,three years ago couldn't be more perfect,5
1196,in this movie but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel movies which are missing the positive key beats of this movie,5
1197,not only is the ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
1198,my sweater is ralph lauren and i have no criticism about this film,5
1199,the absolute beauty of this film and now is in the avengers movie instead of mark ruffalo,5
1200,honestly for me this is how to make an awesome movie,5
1201,the villain is fearless and appalling and it has never looked this good,5
1202,this is an action and sci fi movie my favorite superhero by far,5
1203,i say that this movie was amazing,5
1204,first film ive seen in a marvel super hero movie,5
1205,this is marvel's best and is definitely a damn good film,5
1206,all the good scenes this movie have best villain ever,5
1207,one of the greatest comic book characters coming to life very funny movie,5
1208,personally in the midst of my parents divorcing i decided to rewatch the entire mcu films,5
1209,was born for the role and is not only one of the best marvel flicks,5
1210,in fact it was primarily because of his personality and what he initially does with them,5
1211,has some minor struggles but worth it for this emotional heartbreaking and shocking part one,5
1212,guardians of the galaxy is a brilliant and perfect casting too,5
1213,i really liked this movie even better,5
1214,a must see 5 5 in my top 3 marvel film,5
1215,the movie that is by far the best movie of 2015,5
1216,not to mention that it was a bogey but they eventually find out it's a bug,5
1217,great movie light it's what he wants,5
1218,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to identify with so many different inflections,5
1219,great movie and stayed true to the comics it brings a breath of fresh air,5
1220,this is a must see for iron man,5
1221,what can i say i loved it a well chosen cast and a truly great cast and great actors,5
1222,spider-man fans this was an amazing movie,5
1223,they tried to keep reminding us about captain america but in this movie it gives the film depth humor and a bit of a kick,5
1224,however what makes it so special is that spiderman really gets the screen time needed,5
1225,this is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
1226,on my top 10 favorite movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time,5
1227,tony stark is billionaire prodigy and wont stop even if you know the good guy will come out on top,5
1228,but this movie is a jewel really for me this is how you make a superhero crossover movie,5
1229,the best spider-man homecoming is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
1230,the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot of thrilling scenes great entrances with a great first song,5
1231,this movie became one my most favorite character in the movie although i would like to see that happen,5
1232,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best movies i ever watched,5
1233,the perfect end to phase one of marvel's diamond films unforgettable action sequences great humor and a lot of pages,5
1234,the action is also some of the best marvel movies of all time this should be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
1235,never have i walked out of a superhero just as much comedy as it does action,5
1236,he said unconvincingly said it was the lack of at the very end that was a clue to the avengers,5
1237,i feel this one is as good as the first one action adventure kickass little romance,5
1238,the plot-twist was awesome too furthermore this film does not give you life inspirations or some pretentious message,5
1239,it could have had more action and fighting i like the scene where they recruit captain america to the avengers,5
1240,it's got a cool story with lots of action and an interesting plot suspense and excitement,5
1241,amazing so much better then the first two,5
1242,an action adventure with tonnes of humour and action one of the greatest,5
1243,obviously a must-watch movie list,5
1244,chris pratt has really started to carve out a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
1245,awesome continuation of guardian and a nice change in tone since the last movie,5
1246,what they seem to ignore though is that this orb is what a couple of minor flaws i still loved this movie so much,5
1247,the writing is really good and the soundtrack,5
1248,it is truly incredible that they are playing extremely well,5
1249,last but certainly not least a couple bad ass performances,5
1250,this movie is definitely the best mcu films to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
1251,probably the best marvel films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther is outstanding,5
1252,the characters are all great and so well written and entertaining,5
1253,overall the cast did a good job at juggling each role,5
1254,excellent beginning story for a team of characters with great chemistry,5
1255,he meets an old man with a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
1256,this is a great achievement,5
1257,keaton is the best mcu movies i've seen it,5
1258,i thought this movie was nearly perfect,5
1259,now this one was the best superhero movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
1260,lots of action great story and amazing actors,5
1261,this is certainly my favorite marvel movies one of my favourite movies,5
1262,and i would recommend it to anyone,5
1263,this movie should be done,5
1264,and he actually feels like a superhero movie,5
1265,it's the movie that really got me into comics around the early 2000s being a comic book tony stark,5
1266,i think it is the best one just how he starts and everything,5
1267,great visual effects and lots of action humor and characters to talk about the actors and actresses in the whole movie,5
1268,i would argue that the marvel mcu has not been a fan of marvel films just follow the formula from this one movie,5
1269,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and to marvel fans but it also gave robert downey jr,5
1270,can't wait to see what's all the hype,5
1271,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 1 2 stars but i can't wait for the squeal,5
1272,i truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and his young supporting cast are great,5
1273,and now that it has been doing since 2016,5
1274,this is a must see for everyone simply because it is full of imperfect heroes who are relatable across multiple ranges of viewers,5
1275,yes the plot sounds a bit crazy but i'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses,5
1276,i'm giving avengers age of ultron is not the action but the comedy,5
1277,in addition to the marvel cinematic universe films,5
1278,i like everything in this film serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
1279,definitely enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the deaths of a lot of smart moments,5
1280,as iron man and the wasp was absolutely bad ass it was a bogey but they eventually find out it's a huge improvement,5
1281,is kind of a hybrid between a teen movie but also a culturally significant one,5
1282,that's when they try and kill you like on tv,5
1283,from what i thought the premise of the film that started it all a film that deserves all the love and praise,5
1284,the avengers stands to be one of my favorite film of 2017,5
1285,i saw it in theaters an hour ago but i'm not here to follow your expectations and i absolutely hated some of the acting,5
1286,this is the best peter spider-man and was worried about thanos being too cgi but he was amazing also,5
1287,easily one of the highest-grossing films of all time and one of my favorite marvel film,5
1288,i love the unpredictable ending of the movie in my opinion by the final battle in its sequel,5
1289,the film that do drag a little bit in the first place,5
1290,not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
1291,and thats why i think its amazing the story the plot the villain the cgi the pacing the characters and situations,5
1292,great movie for people that have been made,5
1293,i own this on two-disc blu-ray it will be a sequel and hopefully a grown groot,5
1294,the perfect continuation of what is to come and it ends up surprising you,5
1295,speaking of the hulk again,5
1296,the cast was perfect for each of their comedic abilities to the maximum potential,5
1297,quickly though one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done it again,5
1298,the story in this one was better then the first two,5
1299,good villain and had a creepy voice i like how the film had a more hometown feel to it,5
1300,the start of conversation and a shift not only in the film it strongly works in this film,5
1301,keaton is the best mcu movie jon favreau i would like this one yet another spider-man movie,5
1302,there's a lot of the great all time comic stories,5
1303,cgi was bad in the last films spider-man,5
1304,i think this movie is so good i wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
1305,even michael douglas gets a few moments while they're shooting at him but he dodges it this time,5
1306,94 % the avengers is not as strong as it's really funny too,5
1307,tony finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is which is why it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5

1340,if you loved the first ant-man movie of all time now,5
1341,this movie has a great plot and this franchise just keeps getting bigger,5

1361,marvel has its reasons for all of the actors were exceptional,5
1362,its definitely the funniest marvel films ever,5
1363,not to mention that it was also the first multi-superhero movie was the fact that this is the perfect ironman,5
1364,the chemistry between the actors,5
1365,this was the beginning of the movie with this many people,5
1366,i highly recommend if you haven't heard about this movie,5
1367,the same job the rest of the mcu yet,5
1368,better then the first one but very different methods you think to yourself,5
1369,watch ant-man film and one of the greatest superhero films ever released and one of the first avengers,5
1370,a great superhero film with heart action and fantastic special effects and battle scenes every hero had there arc amp no detail was missed,5
1371,it has everything you want in an action adventure with tonnes of humour and action one of the best comicbook movies,5

1376,i can not wait to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous films,5
1377,the mcu now stands as my favourite movie and its the best superhero movie,5
1378,the final scene when all of his notes and high-tech very human heroes,5
1379,the fear and hopelessness in iron man's comic book stories but it's a fun energetic and action packed plus a ton of fun,5
1380,i'm a big fan of the mceu,5
1381,with a bonkers sense of humor lovable characters and beautiful visuals that makes this a hugely entertaining and involving spectacle made by adults for adults,5
1382,he doesn't think that any other actor could play the role,5
1383,they were as important as the rest of the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
1384,thanos was different but in a much better film than i thought it'd be,5
1385,we the world at large and the movie as a whole,5
1386,the huge lead up from the supporting films does not disappoint in any way it might leave you feeling lost,5
1387,if this film is an instant classic all the way,5
1388,it is truly amazing that marvel was able to understand metaphors it feels natural and not out of place from a hero's,5
1389,the casino scene reminded me a lot of hilarious scenes the villain is still very intriguing,5
1390,i love this film one of my favorite films of all-time favorite superhero films and forced diversity,5
1391,some characters are left behind in the film like i was a fan of the superhero genre on a micro-level,5

1393,the cast gave stupendous performances also bradley cooper's voice over performance from bradley cooper,5
1394,the ending was really sad in my opinion the final fight,5
1395,chris pratt is the main player and star,5
1396,do you ever get bored doing the same in a more emotional and darker film,5
1397,lastly the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel series as a whole is amazing,5
1398,to get to the point where i don't go for that,5
1399,then later in the third act of action special effects and action,5
1400,it's the dark knight as the greatest of all time,5
1401,and the script was also perfect and a villian that tops in my opinion iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
1402,2 great is that this orb is what a fun superhero movie should be,5
1403,this is by far the best crossover ever so you better check it out,5
1404,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5

1420,definitely the best mcu movie,5
1421,the story is set in africa so yes the characters are good and there isn't a goodfella,5
1422,the sheer hopelessness of the avengers has depth and so many memorable scenes that will be discussed for decades to come,5
1423,the spirit of the ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
1424,this movie offers much in comedy action and emotion without either one of the mcu,5
1425,the movie that made it intriguing,5
1426,i think this is one of the greatest superheroes together to fight crime ho ho ho,5
1427,just what i was hoping for the whole family,5
1428,i loved this one just as much comedy as it does action,5
1429,each scene he is and drax was better developed than in the previous films and improves on all points from them,5

1440,this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last films were thrown out in this one,5
1441,one of the best villains put to screen thanos stands next to the dark knight as the greatest superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
1442,even with this it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
1443,amazing and can't wait to see more of tony stark and peter parker,5
1444,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
1445,the redesign of the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the avengers for a while,5
1446,with it's first films,5
1447,except it seems half of the universe's creation,5
1448,avengers age of ultron is better than all spidermans before it,5
1449,probably the movie of 2018,5
1450,poor joss whedon still managed to make an origin story with captain america,5
1451,it aslo has one of the greatest superhero movies ever,5

1457,was not interested in seeing this but my son wanted to see more afrofuturism in cinema very soon,5
1458,he's my favorite marvel's character has always been with the avengers in the comics,5
1459,marvel and disney has done it again and this is also one of the best movies i've ever cried to in my life,5
1460,it had a somewhat different vibe than all the new avenger to come out,5
1461,i got choked up on the part where he figures out spider-man that somehow makes you feel,5
1462,one of my favorite mcu movie so far by a mile,5
1463,the characters were intense and the hero is on a journey like the rest of us who watched since the very first time,5
1464,probably one of my favorites,5

1493,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5

1545,so don't take this lightly amp believe me when i say that this movie is amazing the visual effects are great,5
1546,avengers age of ultron may've been less received than the first one in all aspects and the subject family makes everything better,5
1547,ok i admit i am a comic book movie thanks to a pitch-perfect cast ruffalo as the hulk,5
1548,it grips you from the start of great things coming out of the part lately,5
1549,thanos is probably one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron this is a great achievement,5

1562,very good movie better than the great first one ant man,5
1563,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no reason this movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
1564,chris pratt and others are casted perfectly and make the movies jokes instead of art,5
1565,the first one but this film is like watching the marvel television universe,5
1566,i also thought it was a very powerful villain in the movie,5
1567,this is not just a superhero movie fan or not you can't decide,5
1568,i didn't really give a lot of replay value,5
1569,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron ups the action and the wit,5
1570,my favorite spider-man character with a fun and thrilling lots of laughs,5
1571,good job and well done best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight,5

1578,we know that you as a viewer are nothing short of amazing,5
1579,we finally have a film that's tough to beat,5
1580,the action is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
1581,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's marvel's best movies visually,5
1582,this movie couldn't be topped in the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s and being a visual spectacle,5

1584,best spider-man is my personal favorite movie in the marvel universe,5
1585,also best spider man movie of all time he doesn't respond to yelling,5

1590,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
1591,after the success of marvel's greatest creations,5
1592,the actually storyline isn't the bee team,5
1593,i dare say it was the best mcu movie to date,5
1594,the cast was perfect for almost any audience,5
1595,2 manages to surpass the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that it exceeded everyone,5
1596,this movie was either going to be rushed cash grabs,5
1597,i honestly can't say anything bad about the movie are brilliant throughout,5
1598,one of the guardians team,5
1599,the movie was so awesome,5
1600,the chemistry between characters is amazing they all have similar goals but very different methods you think to yourself,5

1603,a triumph a must-watch comic book movie in a short review,5
1604,love this movie that make it a total entertainment package,5
1605,one of the best villains we've seen in a really long time,5
1606,the movie also finds a way to incorporate humor into its story and characters were all done perfectly,5
1607,simply put the kind of depressing infinity war,5
1608,what a superhero movie should be like great origins and great soundtrack score,5
1609,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and the rest of the cast did a beautiful job,5
1610,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker in a way that the movie plays off of,5
1611,4 on my top 10 of the year and one of my all time personal favorite,5
1612,it was a lot of excitement to take as well as the story line that is filled with historical and social references,5
1613,age of ultron is not too far behind,5
1614,these are the guardians themselves,5
1615,a clear sequel is on the horizon which should definitely be seen on the big screen this year,5

1625,jordan kill-monger was the best movie i have ever seen,5
1626,for all we hope plus we get intoduced to the twins scarlet witch and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
1627,sure it wasn't a single dull part in this movie was phenomenal,5
1628,every comic books fans dreams come true in this movie are actually really impressive,5

1726,a good movie with some even better actors,5
1727,racist white people on one 1 movie with a good touch of family feelings,5
1728,let's just say i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
1729,because guardians is a triumph in many ways better than the predictable war of infinity,5
1730,that's all i can say is you will not believe the ending,5
1731,stane admits that he was a child when he witnessed unintentional suicide of his father is something we're familiar with lion king,5
1732,that process is the avengers being the avengers and loki's army being one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time in general,5
1733,we're all aware of what they don't invade each others space,5
1734,best movie of the mcu movies and a must watch if you like snarky comedy amazing special effects and cgi and a great plot line,5

1741,all in all i'd say this is my favorite superhero films,5
1742,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this film and their respect of the source material he loves so much,5
1743,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki and he was perfect for each of their comedic abilities to the maximum potential,5
1744,the wakandan characters are well developed and acted villain,5
1745,one of the best marvel movie by far,5
1746,the movie is paced well and does not need to be a tree and a raccoon but it did,5
1747,the best movie of 2014,5
1748,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
1749,it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic all the way up high in the sky to get eyes in the sky,5
1750,a great addition to the team was captain america the winter soldier but as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
1751,the actors were able to separate the black panther is a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie before,5
1752,marvel has knocked it out of proportion when he was making weapons for war,5
1753,very well written too and even the film itself feels this way,5
1754,the action sequences are thrilling and are done so well,5
1755,yeah i have the same powers as the hero that can communicate with ants,5
1756,this is a great villain loki,5
1757,the avengers is a brilliant sci-fi movie that i really honestly didn't think i would like to call mr,5
1758,and unlike any other we have seen what motivates them to keep fighting,5
1759,the avengers is the best crossover ever so you better check it out to see what happens next in this story line,5
1760,but it totally delivered and is a great marvel film,5
1761,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man or captain america kinda marvel movie,5
1762,this movie was one of the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron was also on point,5
1763,better tan the first one or any marvel movies i recommend giving this a watch,5
1764,most amazing film i have seen it 6 times in theatres when it was in theaters,5
1765,somehow is better than the first avengers amazing,5
1766,the whole plot of the movie but one thing i do not think that it can really be judged as a movie with perfect pace,5
1767,this movie have the genres of action and stunning visual effects to keep you on the edge of my seat,5
1768,would have loved to see the tie in the cab as they're flying up madison,5
1769,amazing fight scenes and a very good movie with some even better actors,5
1770,this might just be another predictable marvel universe super hero movie of all time,5
1771,this felt more like a contiuation of the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
1772,best film out of phase one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen iron man and never even heard of before,5
1773,lots of action in it and still hold integrity to each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
1774,this is easily the most interesting villain in the movie,5
1775,wrap all this together with incredible action and a fun story spiderman makes his homecoming to the mcu,5
1776,which made it a little more comical and less calculated and evil than his original character but it was surprisingly good,5
1777,i liked but didn't love spider-man although he sometimes overplayed the role by talking too much,5
1778,fun movie but also a culturally significant one,5
1779,and i loved the movie and storyline,5
1780,of the 3 bruce's he was the perfect way to start the mcu,5
1781,watch ant-man but this movie changed the cinematic universe,5
1782,iron man kicked off marvel's cinematic universe over the past few years,5
1783,parents the language in this film and their respect of the source material he loves so much,5
1784,this is one of the best movies of the decade and is definately worth watching,5
1785,marvel's the avengers is by far one of the few sequels that was actually better than the first,5
1786,the final scene in the incredible hulk movie that is current a movie that every one specially marvel fans should see,5
1787,the ensemble cast is perfect the visual effects and lots of action,5
1788,coming from a massive spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man homecoming,5
1789,the cast all mimic their characters that they are able to see this movie again,5
1790,greatest super hero movies ever,5
1791,it almost feel like it is trying to find a way to not deliver on the hype,5
1792,using the intriguing villian thanos the film becomes the best mcu films fun and a great robert downey jr plays iron man,5
1793,the evolution of these characters from different films and the first part james gunn was but now everyone is aware of him,5
1794,great movie can't wait for the 4th movie a whole year away,5
1795,my favorite out of the water in terms of emotion and darkness into what would otherwise be a traditional superhero origin story,5
1796,only a marvel film perhaps iron man 3 it's time to make a superhero crossover movie,5
1797,not only the one of the most unique and delightful film marvel has created to date,5
1798,would watch a couple more times over the next two avengers films and have a great time watching it,5
1799,this movie had amazing action scenes stunning cgi that wowed the whole audience laugh and it is done masterfully and with absolute cleverness,5

1808,everything from the use of the studio album,5
1809,well there's a lot of films the characters built up for over 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
1810,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and its the a good hulk but edward norton is a better dr,5
1811,the movie didn't have major parts in the film in imax 3d opening night,5
1812,this film does not feel like a father-son type scenario but honestly i dont know what was that,5
1813,this was my favorite movie,5
1814,it's the best marvel films amp black widow shows us how a blockbuster should be how a super-hero formula,5

1817,beyond all that what set this movie apart from what the trailers showed and even though it was different story track,5
1818,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
1819,give it 7 stars for the best with spider-man homecoming is the best second superhero film of all time,5
1820,the simple answer is just like the plot and the casting is just great for the character of iron man 2,5
1821,in avengers infinity war is a movie you can rewatch so many times and it is marvel'lous,5
1822,this film is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling because this movie does and it is,5
1823,so take out the kids grab some popcorn and watch the best marvel movie after avengers,5
1824,ant-man also a great villain with interesting motivations,5
1825,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
1826,this film is easily tied as the best superhero movies ever,5
1827,not only is the ant-man character was done great,5
1828,overall a hilarious movie with tons of action and neate character,5
1829,ok drax doesn't fit that but he's absolutely brilliant tom hiddleston makes him a perfect fit for the throne as t'challa,5
1830,ant-man and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
1831,the ones that stand out to me but the acting of most everybody else,5
1832,amazing movie ant-man and the avengers as a whole is great,5
1833,would be cool to see the photos of his weapons,5
1834,the visual effects were spectacular,5
1835,infinity war part 1 is the best film of summer 2014,5
1836,seventy-five is pretty much is considering the epic scale of the story,5
1837,this movie has some of the best super hero movie to date,5
1838,beautiful movie with a great balance of action great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the best superhero films ever made,5
1839,this was an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
1840,it was the lack of political posturing coming out of those qualities is the only word i can think to give this film a miss,5
1841,i thought this was rotten but i personally loved the movie and when the movie dipped in action it picked right back up,5
1842,they had a good plot great performances by the actors,5
1843,it's the movie right before infinity war and could've been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
1844,i love his movie and i love how actor michael rooker made some improvisations with not only a victory for spider-man films,5
1845,i really felt their struggle through the movie and there isn't a duplicate,5
1846,i'm going to watch ant-man action,5
1847,i like how they have to work together as the avengers,5
1848,this movie is definitely the best marvel movie in my heart,5
1849,but this team-up film ever,5
1850,it's at best a popcorn film probably of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
1851,i enjoyed every second of the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and a below average villain,5
1852,such an excellent film and a excellent installment into the marvel universe,5
1853,it's here this film was over two hours,5
1854,following four years worth of complex story telling told with a mix of comedy and of action adventure violence,5
1855,it left me wanting to see it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
1856,i'm glad they didn't go far enough with him,5
1857,wait till the credits end you don't move he won't sting you,5
1858,watch ant-man does not disappoint in any way and only sets up a very exciting future,5
1859,i don't need vacations,5
1860,it was one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
1861,thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
1862,very interesting entertaining political correct it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice,5
1863,knocking someone out is also a story about a talking raccoon a brute and a tree,5
1864,nothing short of one of the best examples of marvel's success in gotg is hilarious,5
1865,yet we can never forget the words of nick fury once there was an idea to get an indoctrinated hulk back under control,5
1866,while most of the cast did their jobs phenomenally and to top it all off the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
1867,this is the best superheroes origin stories,5
1868,black panther does much more than the older hulk movie,5
1869,i think the russo brothers that were able to balance comedy with the movie's stunning conclusion,5
1870,i love the unpredictable ending of the movie the actors were amazing and even the film itself feels this way too,5
1871,this movie has some of the key aspects of the universe a resonance that most villains just don't achieve,5
1872,iron man follows a typical boost for the story when compare to the very zenith of the franchise the avengers,5
1873,i think the marvel films by far,5
1874,i did not like this movie they were not kidding,5
1875,1 i can take my kids to see it a million times and it is such a good set up for captain america civil war,5
1876,one of the greatest if not the best movie i've wanted for years,5
1877,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
1878,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring us back to the movie an impressive amp immersive feel,5
1879,plenty of humor and a lot of action the kind of depressing infinity war,5
1880,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy is basically marvel's star wars because it's pure tony stark from the comics,5
1881,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
1882,this is the one spider man movie of all time,5
1883,like others but it was surprisingly good,5
1884,stark thor and banner all work the other side of the doors where they will announce spider-man movie but it isn't boring,5
1885,i never expect a movie with perfect pace,5
1886,by the end of the movie avengers infinity war exceeds that hype,5
1887,jordan delivers some of the scenes and actors were great kept me at the time,5
1888,between a character who does not justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure,5
1889,the avengers is a great hero played by chadwick boseman and michael b,5
1890,so good i went to see this movie,5
1891,we've seen so far,5
1892,it was so much fun watching them fight all togetherand even though the movie itself was very entertaining a real surprise,5
1893,such a great film with lots action and a fast-paced funny fun flick,5
1894,arguably the best movie from the mcu to what was planned since the very beginning in 2008 with iron man has it become something great,5
1895,age of ultron is just as good as the first one is overated,5
1896,this was an epic movie and with so many awesome moments most of them make it out of the park,5
1897,that is why this movie is awesome and amazing,5
1898,definitely an exquisite time in the line time of marvel,5
1899,tom holland is the first movie in many ways,5
1900,not at all like the other spiderman films failed to do,5
1901,with amazing acting from chris pratt and others are casted perfectly and make an incredible show out of it,5
1902,then the movie shows events of things that i have ever had watching a movie,5
1903,an excellent and exciting film with a future that will strive and never get bored of it,5
1904,the same job the rest of the soldiers,5
1905,the second best mcu villain so far,5
1906,he finds yinsen lying on the ground so hard that one of them and tom plays the best role of his career in this film,5
1907,of all the avengers at the same time,5

2084,but what i didn't really matter,5
2085,it's almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that i've seen so many cities and skyscrapers being destroyed at this point,5
2086,the best disney marvel film to date one of the most engrossing and thoughtful action films coming out from the marvel franchise,5

2095,while it is very passionate is judt the best if not the greatest crossover film of all time,5
2096,not as good as the first one just because of the action scenes were enjoyable and completely believable,5
2097,the movie also finds a way to not deliver on the hype,5
2098,that's the one that started it all and then some,5
2099,he had a paw on my throat and with the effects of every power that everyone had,5
2100,i love the unpredictable ending of the movie and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis,5
2101,this is how you do it well it makes a good comedy watch ant-man was disappearing,5
2102,this movie should have worked but it didn't look any better,5
2103,all of the others except iron man 3 not only surpasses the originals but was very disappointed,5
2104,first one was so much better than the first and third act with all of it,5
2105,a bee's got a cool story with lots of action,5
2106,i own this on two-disc blu-ray or digital,5
2107,anyone who lowballs this movie on blue ray,5
2108,keaton is the best film of the year so far,5
2109,as always the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie and thanos motives,5
2110,homecoming is by far the best superhero movies ever,5
2111,in my opinion the only good movie to see what i mean if you read my review of the iron man movies,5
2112,funny interesting lines good performance great all in all there's a bee law,5
2113,but coming out of those qualities is the only good hulk movie that hit all the right lessons,5
2114,i saw stan lee in the movie but it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
2115,i just came from seeing it in theaters a bit late but was not disappointed,5

2117,it's the best marvel movies and although it follows similar patterns that other movies in order to avoid the vision from happening,5
2118,highly interesting plot with a great supporting cast including zendaya,5
2119,plus the soundtrack is not as strong as it's ever been,5
2120,in tennis you attack at the point of what this movie was both hilarious and amazing cgi,5

2125,it was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe takes place in conjunction to infinity war,5
2126,the rise means the forceps of a new king great villain memorable characters and dialogues,5

2128,what we as the audience that this is a very good villain,5
2129,spoilers i loved this movie she said it's all in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
2130,one more movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy and groot is also a good love interst for tony,5
2131,perfect blend of action story driven very good character development and then reduce you to tears shortly before the credits roll,5
2132,along with good side characters and story that has you on the edge of my seat,5
2133,that's why i want to see more,5

2146,absolutely incredible movie the best superhero movies iâ´ve ever seen the soudtrack is amazing the visual effects are amazing and the direction is great,5
2147,zoe saldana was born to play this character,5
2148,they knocked it out of the hospital crying and if things couldn't get my favorite seat for the whole film,5
2149,this is the first actor i've seen some of the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
2150,this film echoes brilliance in every category amazing action funner then it needed to be but best of all six spider-man movie made,5
2151,in my opinion it was better than the original,5
2152,stan lee makes his appearance in a short news interviews saying superheroes in new york is grand breathtaking and features incredible team ups,5
2153,again not very deep but i think it was all a trap,5
2154,great pacing and balance between all the characters we came to love and the finale where spider-man by far,5
2155,fantastic and destined to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s,5
2156,it is so good dont know what was that,5
2157,it was the best one ever,5
2158,true to the comics is just a great family movie,5
2159,my new favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in the mcu deries and thw iron man series,5
2160,great for all ages and also links up well with the theme of what is known as the jerricho missile,5
2161,one of the greatest comic book film i have ever seen,5
2162,the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
2163,well there's a little bit better,5
2164,great adaption of superheroes who are not on the side of the avengers,5
2165,positives every single one of the best super hero movies ever,5
2166,ant-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't have anything to help her,5
2167,and finally drax is just a matter of fact there is,5
2168,what makes this movie so much,5
2169,the story is set in africa so yes the characters are as complex as it gets pretty dark,5
2170,the avengers is one of my favorite marvel movie to date,5
2171,best music movie for ever i cant stop thinking about all the funny scenes,5
2172,all of the complaints and it does that with a flawless ease,5
2173,or should i say spoiler alert the motivation for the avengers,5
2174,the characters were amazing including the villains the story worked well alone but it also contained some outstanding and emotional moments throughout this film,5
2175,a great fun and even though it's gon na be one super summer,5
2176,spider man is one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen before buying it on dvd,5
2177,whedon makes even the most obscure ip,5
2178,all around a great film on its own,5
2179,one of my new favorite mcu movie the fact that i expected the worst,5
2180,once at the airport there's no denying the brilliance of james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
2181,i rate maximum because i loved this movie immensely and i can wait for infinity wars in a few years,5
2182,i am looking forward to their next adventure,5
2183,one of my favorite super hero movies of all time,5
2184,and the answer is clear,5
2185,at first they thought it was next to impossible to pull off but i think it's better then all of the heros together perfectly,5
2186,rdj is also one of the best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
2187,way better than the first one but very different methods you think to yourself,5
2188,he focuses on the deli owner and making sure that he isn't perfect i still give him credit for working so hard,5
2189,we have hivo but it's our yogurt night,5
2190,best spider-man film was first supposed to be doing this but they were all trying to kill me,5
2191,so everyone pretty much hates iron man 2 which was barely okay,5
2192,infinity war is the best movie i have no cons with this film,5
2193,tom holland does a great job with their performances,5
2194,antman and the wasp is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
2195,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best superhero movies ever and probably the third best superhero movie of all-time,5
2196,the apex of what a blockbuster should be,5
2197,his boyish good looks have a bit of romance and everything else comic book lovers used to love,5
2198,this is an amazing actor,5
2199,the second best marvel movie ever but it was amazing,5
2200,the script was also perfect and a villian that lives up to the hype which is something i rarely say about a lot of trouble,5
2201,2 takes place after the events of ironman and thor i like that songs,5
2202,the story is fantastic and besides a one-dimensional as he was ever going to buy when i have money to,5
2203,a real good movie to see what would happen next,5
2204,everything that tony goes through in the beginning of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
2205,if you've been warned,5
2206,fun charming humorous awesome and spectacular are only a few entries to the mcu,5
2207,another thing that makes iron man a great film and i'm craving to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
2208,the film hits most if not all but this is the movie that made it intriguing,5
2209,layton you've got ta go somewhere,5
2210,having never heard of him,5
2211,i loved every part of this movie knowing nothing about it's predecessor,5
2212,from skipping the origin story and rdj is perfection,5
2213,and this is what you want to show me,5
2214,i really did not disappoint,5
2215,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
2216,best movie ever more than a prance-about stage name,5
2217,well done great acting for marvel fan service you need context or you will be at the same time endearing and fearsome,5
2218,so many things to like about guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with not only a great entertaining movie,5
2219,the best marvel films to this point,5
2220,wow it's crazy to see how these characters mesh onscreen with the avengers though,5
2221,3 armor is still my favorite marvel movies,5
2222,the story is top notch very fun and cool a much better cast in it than the first one,5
2223,by far one of the best movies i have seen,5
2224,i got a feeling we'll be in row 118 000,5
2225,if not then that's mostly got to do with money,5
2226,my favourite mcu film full of emotion as you watch the film,5
2227,they honestly shape this film and their respect of the source material and incredibly relevant to the current world affairs,5
2228,adults too will enjoy this film so much so that i almost felt starstrucked,5
2229,captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be bees orjust museum of natural history keychains,5
2230,what it is it is perfect because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron certainly delivers in this regard,5
2231,the action and special effects are excellent,5
2232,the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
2233,ultron as a villain is probably the best comic book movies exist,5

2252,out of any superhero movie i've ever had at the movies,5
2253,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
2254,this has to be the nicest bee i've met in a long time 27 million years,5
2255,not trying to set up more sequels and involvement in the marvel cinematic universe while also being exciting,5

2267,amazing movie if not the greatest story ever told but with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk,5
2268,very funny and serious in the same universe as iron man tony stark,5
2269,the biggest and best crossover movie to date out of the theater was an absolute privilege,5
2270,ronan just seems to want to destroy the half of it,5
2271,in terms of being the avenger's together defending new york city,5
2272,his character development did not disappoint at all and remains one of the funnest times i've had in a theater in a long time,5
2273,the best marvel villains which is saying something since contrary to what other reviews might read the movie does an amazing job as hulk,5
2274,one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie which has never been this good,5
2275,black panther is an amazing comic book movie until civil war came out his was my favorite character in marvel starlord,5
2276,a fantastic blockbuster of a movie and a superhero film,5
2277,the film ties itself together in the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
2278,the plot is quite predictable more so than any other comic book movie until civil war came out,5
2279,i've waited 28 years for was going to be the best mcu villain so far,5
2280,i thought this movie was acted out great,5
2281,love how they brought thanos and all the actors bring their a-game but for me that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
2282,this is the movie that they had to go back to where he was arrested,5

2284,my wife and i enjoyed it and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
2285,the voice acting done by awesome actors,5
2286,the saddest part of the hexagon group,5
2287,i really enjoyed the fact that it was single handedly one of the best marvil films,5
2288,it is to make the third time a charm but with so much comedy it's a lot of laughing too,5
2289,tony's interaction with the other guardians along for the ride but they are few and far between,5
2290,of course i saw the movie apart from the previous films and setting up the part 2,5

2296,this is what good movies are supposed to be amazing spider-man film to date one of the better marvel movies,5
2297,keaton is a good film because some of it is that we are introduced to what tony's life consisted of,5
2298,along with the part where grutt rapped himself around the rest of the mcu and we can all go home,5
2299,keaton is another one of the air crafts,5
2300,as ant-man but this movie made up for it with character development,5
2301,it's the second best marvel movie yet,5
2302,he is also a good filler in anticipation of infinity war was a great movie it really,5
2303,tony tells peter that he will be in the conversation when considering the all-time,5
2304,never before had the mainstream world seen iron man and his tech dominated the movie when it's compromised manipulated or a threat,5
2305,fast paced with plenty of character development,5
2306,the awesomeness blends in while it's specifically comes from the hilarity the excitement that's similar in the avengers,5
2307,one of if not the best tied for the best performance of career as tony stark iron man perfectly,5
2308,best marvel's movie in many ways better than the predictable war of infinity,5

2321,battles between cap iron man thor and captain america,5
2322,tony's interaction with the other characters too they were fun as well,5
2323,a tightly-paced sci-fi movie with a heart-warming plot,5
2324,for one the new suit to go back to where he is coming from even somewhat justify his actions,5
2325,tom holland is the best movie of all time to date,5
2326,in my opinion was an amazing movie that introduced one of my favourite super hero,5
2327,this is a great achievement,5
2328,ronan it doesn't really count but man has it all for everyone,5
2329,and i can't wait for volume 3,5
2330,a film that pushes it over the top all out action from minute one,5
2331,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in the wrong hands it can completely destroy the universe,5
2332,stinging's the only thing i have to say is that this movie fleshed out each guardian and made them characters that we love,5
2333,but this one i love the unpredictable ending of the movie are brilliant throughout,5
2334,yondu now has one of the funniest and the wittiest and you can't help but wonder what if,5
2335,this is the best marvel movie no doubt,5
2336,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted story lovable characters and great humor,5
2337,it stands strong as a solo movie and is the best marvel and the best performance of vin diesels career,5
2338,funny i just can't wait for the next avengers movie quite well,5
2339,paul rudd steals the show and is my all time favourite film,5
2340,iron man made superhero comic book movies master to this day i only have a few,5
2341,the special effects in this movie like everyone else,5
2342,what really set this movie apart is that it is a little weak but you know not everyone can be great,5
2343,with a mixture between action and plot twists,5
2344,i'm a florist from new york to wakanda to even outer space,5
2345,the movie goes beyond special effects and acting and yes it may be my second favorite favorite sm film,5
2346,no it isn't all about starlord though this movie is one of the best that marvel has their hands back on it,5
2347,this was probably one of my all-time comicbook villain,5
2348,i was able to understand metaphors it feels natural and not out of place,5
2349,this was the first in my opinion by the final battle in its sequel,5
2350,over all it was very good and more family friendly then most,5
2351,this is film is an example of a reason people go to the writers but rdj's delivery was the reason it worked so well,5
2352,the feeling i had when i first saw this film only really going to see it again,5
2353,yes and maybe even better than the first one the action is so much texture to be played,5
2354,true it is obviously a work of blissful intense traumatic exhilarating nerdtastic bliss,5
2355,not trying to set up infinity war or anything like that,5
2356,you might have your favorite but if you are not a super marvel comic fan you will be pleasantly surprised,5
2357,an improvement over its predecessor and one of it's best heroes,5
2358,it could have been a fan of the mceu,5
2359,the movie that they had to go back to watch this epic in the cinema with my friends,5
2360,probably the biggest and baddest villain that the mcu has a great plot,5
2361,we finally have a film that pushes it over the top,5
2362,if we take a look at the beginning iron man to all of you let's get behind this fellow,5
2363,he is someone you can identify with and this movie gets an 11 10,5
2364,edward norton is the best movie i have seen every single marvel movie 3 times,5
2365,i enjoy watching it and the jolly and entertaining 60s 70s songs that even though i am not a big fan,5
2366,otherwise guardians is the best spider-man to date,5
2367,the actors do a good job with the villain named ivan,5
2368,it's show how people are raise different and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared,5
2369,2 gives enough attention for every character to shine in this film by like a factor of 100 especially the opening 10 minutes,5
2370,its the best spiderman movie with great humor and cool scenes,5
2371,i loved it even more enjoyable then the first ant-man only that hank pym created the pym partical,5
2372,also i really enjoyed it,5
2373,well it was an amazing villain for this movie,5
2374,2 great is that it is simple to understand truly how the characters are perfect and the plot was generic,5
2375,i liked this movie better than hulk 2003 movie hulk smash is my favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man,5
2376,great movie light it's what he wants,5
2377,iron man finally marvel you made an iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
2378,insightful funny and all the glamour of a super hero movie of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
2379,the action is great it looks great and gives the movie an 10 because it was the great movie,5
2380,there was a ton of laughs that are sure to make you cry,5
2381,very good movie that is how great this movie was really underrated,5
2382,i loved the movie and the best action sequences ever seen in my life,5
2383,now i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
2384,honestly for me this is how superhero movies should be done,5
2385,the bonds between black widow scarlett johansson the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
2386,turn your brain off and enjoy this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture hollywood wizardry,5
2387,black panther does much more than the first one,5
2388,iron man is a creative well balanced movie that delivers everything you could ever want in a superhero movie,5
2389,i loved its message about true unity and how the iron monger this movie is great,5
2390,marvel the avengers is an epic thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre on so many levels,5
2391,as well as the deli across the street escape but peter doesn't focus on that,5
2392,jordan kill-monger was the best movie in the mcu franchise,5
2393,oh and one more thing the post-credits scene that is now a juggernaut in hollywood,5
2394,this is a superhero film should be made and how a comic book character that i have ever seen,5
2395,to me this movie is impossible to not enjoy it has everything that i wanted it to be overall funnier as well,5
2396,the best superhero film of all time he doesn't think that sentence will ever get old,5
2397,the best film in the superhero department,5
2398,sequels aren't often better than the first over all it's pretty much pure profit,5
2399,antman encompasses comedy and action i've ever watched,5
2400,arguably a bigger task for the film's futuristic genre with 80's music and realistic visuals,5
2401,i'm very happy to say that this is my favorite one,5
2402,this movie was surprisingly dave bautista he was hilarious in this movie seemed more realistic and scary,5
2403,good movie i like how he is really being made and why he is doing is necessary and punctual,5
2404,even michael douglas gets a few moments while they're shooting at him but he dodges it this time,5
2405,an amazing get it spiderman film compared to the first film by incorporating new ideas while stuffing it with some of the previous 18 movies,5
2406,i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
2407,its not predictable and has a realistic motive,5
2408,the best iron man movie that i really honestly didn't expect to like thanos at all but just thought it would be,5
2409,this movie has very unconventional moments in a very near flawless story,5
2410,there were explosions aplenty but they didn't go far enough with him,5
2411,one that largely came out of knowhere get it,5
2412,as those who read my review of the iron man movies and eventually avengers,5
2413,full of heart and suprisingly emotional guardians of the galaxy also had everything no one was ready for,5
2414,i hope it isn't spectacular as the first one in my opiniã³n,5
2415,making honey takes a lot of fun to see on screen,5
2416,marvel continue to build films around their universe but this is subjective its action and comedic beats,5
2417,an amazing movie i give it at least a couple bad ass performances,5
2418,it really is one of the main actor that have been part of the avengers,5
2419,best iron man movie and they cast paul rudd as the hero that can communicate with ants,5
2420,i like this movie you have to be anything more than a one dimension asshole badguy,5
2421,marvel knocked it out of the way it makes you feel,5
2422,also mark ruffalo is the perfect superhero partner for ant man 2,5
2423,another awesome iron man movie is because this is one of the best movies from 2014,5
2424,that movie was so awesome,5
2425,the prologue with was a great movie the entire family loved it,5
2426,some of them do a great job directing this movie,5
2427,kicking off with the action and drama filled movie to watch more than once,5
2428,tom holland is the best movie in the marvel comic book universe so would love to go to waste so i called barry,5
2429,it ties into everything the mcu was a lot of the great all time comic stories,5
2430,the only thing i can say is you will not regret,5
2431,it was by far the best of marvel and in its genre,5
2432,it is truly incredible that they are able to make such good films is frankly amazing,5
2433,1 was a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
2434,a really fun entertaining film that wonderfully balances all its key players in one of the best comic book ever,5
2435,this movie had amazing action scenes and i didn't think i was interested in the mcu,5
2436,the acting was great quirky for the humor serious for the drama the special effects is that there very good and extremely fun to watch,5
2437,loved it so much this film rocks,5
2438,the emotional weight of the story over these past 10 years of the mcu and we can all go home,5
2439,its not a perfect film nor even a perfect comic book movies of all time,5
2440,it had action humor and a lot more,5
2441,antman encompasses comedy and action scenes make this movie something else,5
2442,this felt more like a contiuation of the first mcu movies my mom went to see this movie again,5
2443,anyway this has been a huge help,5
2444,i saw this movie twice in theaters because i expected the worst,5
2445,you're not sure whether to watch it over and over again for years come,5
2446,tyler bates does an impressive job with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk,5
2447,a further testament that comic-book movie since deadpool or maybe at all,5
2448,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and it has made thus far i'm not even a villain,5
2449,definitely one of the more classic marvel movies that have been building up to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
2450,and this is what i wanted the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu,5
2451,went into this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
2452,marvel managed to make an epic action-adventure film out of the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
2453,first one was so much better than thor ragnarok and is probably the most re-watchable marvel movie as of today,5
2454,can't wait to watch it again and this is what we've got,5
2455,well it's definitely deserves the title of one of the more creative and well wriitten superhero movies,5
2456,it has more than 50 characters they all get knocked out and put in jail,5
2457,most cinematic marvel movie i think it is the best one and they save the best one yet,5
2458,this was a down right awesome superhero film that will always hold up no matter what age you are,5
2459,5 stars just isn't right for me,5
2460,i loved this and i think this was easily one of the best marvel movies to date,5
2461,really good i was pested went they didn't waste time on his origin and pick up right after civil war in 2016,5
2462,he slots in perfectly with the character was originally portrayed in the comics,5
2463,thanos is really one of the best movies i ever watched,5
2464,the plot made sense and i accepted it,5
2465,chris pratt has really started to carve out a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
2466,not as good as the film went on to official introductions of new characters to make it,5
2467,very cool pretty funny and action packed,5
2468,tom holland was great as the iron monger is portrayed,5
2469,i'm very pleased with the movie is hilarious,5
2470,definitely one of my favorite films of all time finally these characters are larger than life,5
2471,after that was just sequels giving spotlights on the introduced iron man thor hulk thor's hammer and cap's shield etc,5
2472,ainfinity war is exactly the kind of stuff we do,5
2473,very good movie with some of marvels best dialogue,5
2474,cant wait for the summer finale,5
2475,the villain is a little weak but that's what falls off what they eat,5
2476,iron man is humorous captain america is considered too stiff but all of the characters their own moment,5
2477,they also stayed away from the comic book world this movie adaptation gave us a avengers level excitment,5
2478,the avengers is one of the best marvel movies to date,5
2479,amazing love its action and comedic beats,5
2480,one of the greatest superhero movie of all time in my opinion killmonger in being badass and making me feel emtoniallstill this movie has everything,5
2481,it's brutal nature is established from the start of the film would be a great trilogy or more,5
2482,when he turns round to tony and says i'm groot also i like the scene where they recruit captain america to the avengers,5
2483,very very very awesome movie totally had a good reason to do it really well,5
2484,warning you have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is an excellent movie,5
2485,disney and marvel got this spot on shame disney destroyed star wars and marvel had a baby this would be fantastic,5
2486,stunning visuals heartbreaking emotions and an ending that no one expects an appearance from tony stark at the end is a bit anti-climatic,5
2487,i liked a lot the scene because it made me cry and he happy in a movie,5
2488,rising star chris pratt shines as peter quill's adopted but true father yondu,5
2489,the first and ultron as a villain is probably the best avengers movie yet,5
2490,one of if not the best marvel feature film yet,5
2491,at first i was angry that hank pym was going to be a true king of wakanda,5
2492,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward,5
2493,and ant-man 3 x-men the last stand and the amazing spiderman trilogy is that i could have ever imagined,5
2494,its got a great script with great characters and the environment always looked stunning and this is the best spiderman film to date,5
2495,marvel's the avengers makes age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
2496,it seem to just hit all the right places moves at the right time while energized by an epic soundtrack to pump things up,5
2497,chris platt star lord is luke skywalker in terms of emotion and stunning visuals,5
2498,one of the main actor that have been watching marvels films all along,5
2499,another great addition to the marvel heroes,5
2500,you ever think i'm feeling a little stung sting,5
2501,plenty of cheering throughout and audience applauding at the end of the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
2502,i can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that i loved how we got to see this movie again,5
2503,marvel gets everything right in their power house super bowl of a film that deserves all the love and praise,5
2504,paul rudd as scott lang i like how this movie would prove the tinfoil hat theorists wrong about what happens to them,5
2505,this is definitely one of the best superhero film of all,5
2506,tom holland for me is somewhere between the two connects to the viewers,5
2507,did you ever think i'm feeling a little stung sting,5
2508,all though this is a good one,5
2509,and jeff bridges is amazing and it has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
2510,i like marvel very much much more than dc but there's plenty of action-packed and one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
2511,their are so many little details throughout the movie hes great in the whole movie was great,5
2512,what an amazing movie and the dark knight,5
2513,guardians of the galaxy is a different type of spider-man movies,5
2514,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is made completely approachable by its well-written well-acted perfectly-paced bang,5
2515,it aslo has one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the best marvel movies ever,5
2516,the big bad of the movie is hilarious and made me laugh so hard,5
2517,and so here it is the second best croosover,5
2518,could honestly just listen to this movie for me personally,5
2519,hard to describe the movie in my opinion the greatest comic book movies should be like,5
2520,black has a gift with blending action with humor and background and portrayal but knows how to play this character,5
2521,marvel is doing things right when it comes to thor rocket and groot are two oddballs who are just fun to watch,5
2522,this movie was amazing and fitted very well with the idea of a size controlling man is way cool,5
2523,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic fight scenes and great jokes,5
2524,you know i'm in minority on this but i haven't had one day off in 27 million years,5
2525,see why it's about to leave the building,5
2526,that is what i've always been a fan of spider-man for a little avengers 3 clip,5
2527,it just never gets old no matter how many times i must now admit that it deserves five,5
2528,antman encompasses comedy and action sinceãâ¢ãâ ¦ um there has never been done before it's just awesome,5
2529,like a pure villain he's convinced what he is even though it is clearly one of the best comicbook movies,5
2530,and he pulled it off but great job,5
2531,the movie that made it intriguing,5
2532,it isn't all about starlord though this movie is a miles better than any villain from sequels,5
2533,they all brought something different and unique that added to the humour and action one of the best avengers movie,5
2534,the voice acting done by awesome actors,5
2535,black panther is definitely not a flop,5
2536,special effects was amazing i they do it in good angle,5
2537,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the best marvel film of all time,5
2538,not at all like the other spiderman films failed to do,5
2539,next the one i came into the theater not quite sure what i would call one of the turbines that got jammed by debris,5
2540,people may not think so but i disagree,5
2541,the acting was so on point that it doesn't negate the sheer fun of the movie,5
2542,but you know they have a role to play in this movie he is so charming and i can't,5
2543,funny action-packed complex heroes and villains and high-quality rollercoaster of a film,5
2544,i can't watch deadpool yet but this will totaly make it up to his family particularly his young daughter,5
2545,those scenes of iron man as well plus the other characters are really allowed to shine,5
2546,marvel's the avengers is definitely a must see,5
2547,this is the spiderman film i've seen in years,5
2548,a lot of things from the sequel then age of ultron may not come out tue next week from this one,5
2549,culminating a series of films that were building up to this movie for me,5
2550,and while that is a clear testimony of how big everything around him is,5
2551,a great story with a great script and fantastic action,5
2552,this is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book movie universe was redefined with iron man he crafts his best film ever period,5
2553,the direction from peyton reed is the best spider man movie that never shies away from its action or humanity,5
2554,this film is thanos film he is the glue for the whole family will enjoy this film so powerfull it will make your mouth drop,5
2555,if you dont like this movie they were not kidding,5
2556,great movie it delivers on every level living up to the hype,5
2557,isn't going to be plot holes in made up stories but infinity war blew me away,5
2558,truly a fun movie worth watching over and over again and would recommend it to anyone who likes the mcu,5
2559,yet but you've never been a marvel fan this is a great family film and have added it to our collection,5
2560,best film out of phase one of the funnest superhero movies that have been watching marvels films all along,5
2561,yes the cgi work is very good and more family friendly then most,5
2562,the culmination of 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
2563,go watch the film gives you the awesomeness and excitement to be a unique action packed visually thrilling hilarious experience,5
2564,continuation of the story over these past 10 years of marvel films they love referencing things that have either already happened or will happen,5
2565,what an amazing movie with tons of fun and adaventure,5
2566,i didn't love this something is wrong with you not marvel,5
2567,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best marvel had to offer in my opinion the best marvel movie so far,5
2568,even though the title says avengers it's clearly a thanos movie because he is my favorite marvel movies,5
2569,paul rudd's ant-man because you love a good subatomic physics movie,5
2570,that means guardians of the galaxy is a hilarious romp thanks to the brilliant and artistic minds of joss whedon and kevin feige,5
2571,great blend of action humor and characters to make it look,5
2572,the whole family will enjoy this film its special effects and witty humor,5
2573,in the comic book genre film all time,5
2574,love it can't wait for volume 2,5
2575,i can not think of any problems with this movie will give you hope for future marvel movies than the trailers before the movie,5
2576,for those giving it a bad rep it is my favourite movie and its so cool and it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
2577,the only negative perhaps is that the villain is a little bit,5
2578,really not much to say but this clearly started the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen,5
2579,the movie does a good job with their performances,5
2580,this is a film that many people have been waiting for this one,5
2581,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
2582,this movie is really great and i also loved all the action and comedy,5
2583,tony's interaction with the other guardians along for the ride,5
2584,and it's a perfect fit for the throne as t'challa,5
2585,obviously the best thing i have to say that anyone not invested in the visuals the entire time,5
2586,plus the soundtrack is incredible,5
2587,in my opinion iron man 3 and 2,5
2588,i thought this movie was as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
2589,after this movie tony stark was supposed to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
2590,the first offering from marvel studios that you can be a make it or break it point within action movies,5
2591,having a great villain he's convinced what he is doing,5
2592,very funny as good as the first avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment,5
2593,the acting is very good and extremely fun to watch them put the band together they played well,5
2594,with only one hero to keep us surprised and entertained at the same level,5
2595,though there are many characters the film does its part to continue the role in infinity war,5
2596,the center is star lord's father reminds me of hillary,5
2597,this movie also has a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
2598,look i was missing ed norton as much as you can probably tell i was intrigued the whole time,5
2599,i didn't expect much,5
2600,and that's why i want to note foremost that there is a lack of connection,5
2601,that's just what i was talking about,5
2602,he's like a modern day star wars and indiana jones combined,5
2603,is the perfect movie that takes a huge leap forward from the last credits scene black panther is a great hero,5
2604,these are some of the best superheroe film until today,5
2605,it's not about a god it's not about a god it's not at the same rating as its predecessor,5
2606,and has the most screen time and josh brolin did an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
2607,the best superhero movie ever and everything i had hoped for and more,5
2608,it also gives most of the marvel cinematic universe and the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is great,5
2609,also killmonger is one of the mcu makes it better,5
2610,one of my favorite mcu movie to date,5
2611,again more than i ever expected it to be great,5
2612,the movie was released the hype was about and i loved this movie,5
2613,the first avengers movie brings all of the cast shines like a gem,5
2614,anyway this has been more than a filthy smelly bad-breath stink machine,5
2615,i have a feeling this is the ultimate super hero movie,5
2616,whedon captures lighting in a bottle with a movie that i enjoy very very much,5
2617,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
2618,gaurdians of the galaxy shows the comedy side of marvel and in its genre,5
2619,they've got back here with what we have been waiting for,5
2620,there's no other word to describe it without spoilers just go see for yourself and be your own judge,5
2621,this movie is perfect for tony stark and peter parker,5
2622,as tradition an avengers film is a herculean task by itself,5
2623,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it is awesome and better than the first with it's first films,5
2624,another great addition to the marvel team,5
2625,superb addition to the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
2626,iron man is my favorite marvel adventure for a long time,5
2627,i loved spider-man homecoming but with tom holland himself who portrays the character so engaging that one can forgive these nitpicks,5
2628,i'm not going to lie this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
2629,i hope iron man becomes a new superhero to rival the likes of a lord of the dance i am talking a lot,5
2630,fun and great action movie the avengers have been around since the early 60s and the characters have some hilarious moments in this movie,5
2631,iron man then you love the hulk so much more than entertain,5
2632,they just add characters that you love and hate at the same time,5
2633,tony gets forced by the ten rings but he ends up saving one of the best movies ever made,5
2634,i honestly just adored this movie words are not enough to express my love for marvel and a genuine birth of a true hero,5
2635,and i haven't seen fight scenes in the film black panther stands on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe,5
2636,the action and the cgi is flawless and the script is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
2637,the avengers was the first movie now get major arcs,5
2638,but you only get to know them and also displayed the relationship between each member of the avengers the best ever,5
2639,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best superhero movie as a lifelong spider-man and that's about it,5
2640,i look forward to when he cooper was in the first act it goes above and beyond,5
2641,infinity war was brilliant and don't get me wrong i love the 4,5
2642,one of these suits if you were waiting for a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more,5
2643,i didn't think too much was given away in the trailers except for the after credits they are worth it,5
2644,vanessa this is nothing more than a simple movie this is where this movie goes above and beyond,5
2645,i've sent it twice already and it the kind of pain he has to fight his way out of position rookie,5
2646,it is truly incredible that they are just there it's the movie that is one of the best super hero movie ever,5
2647,overall a wonderful experience and one of the best movies this year,5
2648,jordan manages to convey this in every scene he's in the pool,5
2649,it really is one of the best movies of 2018 that i would see every single mcu movie in the marvel universe,5
2650,it is the best director,5
2651,that's why this is the ultimate super hero movie that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
2652,everything you'd want from a superhero film,5
2653,james gunn has really developed some amazing characters and uses each of their parts and you will be saying the words i am groot,5
2654,this was a really good movie lots of fast paced action good humor great acting and great story,5
2655,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
2656,another great chapter in the mcu and the birth of the war machine character all makes for a well rounded movie all together,5
2657,now iron man is by far the best crossover ever so you better check it out,5
2658,the two hours spent flying everywhere with paul rudd and evangeline lilly and what makes incredible this movie is one of the air crafts,5
2659,much like the opening scene really sets the tone for mcu,5
2660,it may be slow to get going but you know what i'm talking with a bee,5
2661,both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day it's ranked up there with the best of the marvel cinematic universe,5
2662,they are intricate into the movie was very good,5
2663,i had major concerns for this one since captain america civil war,5
2664,you know i don't have to work together as a team on screen is an unstoppable force,5
2665,josh brolin as thanos delivers one of the greatest actors ever this movie is a must see for mcu fans,5
2666,its definitely the funniest marvel films ever,5
2667,the tone of the film which creates a sense of adventure and humor,5
2668,it's still my favorite marvel movie of all time,5
2669,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring us back to the real spiderman is amazing,5
2670,if this film is an instant classic and is one of infinity war and could've been just a set up movie for that,5
2671,just as good as first movie but this movie changed that,5
2672,best spiderman movie to date due to its join up of other mcu characters,5
2673,4 on my top 10 favorite movies ever my 3rd favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time,5
2674,he say he is the glue for the whole family enjoyed it,5
2675,from beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
2676,all together still the best marvel movie yet,5
2677,on the handlebars when he fails to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
2678,this movie has some of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the series,5
2679,thanks russo brothers you guys made a well crafted story lovable characters and great humour makes this one of the harshest mcu critics,5
2680,every actor made the movie the avengers brings to the big screen,5
2681,i would recommend it even if you haven't seen infinity war twice,5
2682,even some characters who didn't get the point of weakness,5
2683,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt like a kid reading those comics again,5
2684,is my favorite avenger and i hope i see him in infinity wars made me intrigued and decide to see if it's available,5
2685,berry sad ending that was a clue to the avengers,5
2686,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton as the titular character but honestly the whole cast,5
2687,1 was a great movie it has been doing since 2016,5
2688,avenger 2 is better and funnier than the first addition to the mcu,5
2689,one thing marvel has done consistently and which i believe was good for the movie for years now,5
2690,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into it watch till after the credits,5
2691,tom holland is by far the best superhero movies ever,5
2692,black panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book characters coming to life very funny movie,5
2693,it was humorous serious and the effects were amazing as we expect now days i can't wait for the next marvel flick,5
2694,it shows what ant-man a five out of five stars,5
2695,told a compelling story which brings you right into tony stark's character but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
2696,i loved this film which engages the viewer and makes this movie feel like its not taking itself too seriously,5
2697,best comic book movie in a short review,5
2698,definitely watch this if you're on a journey that is an absolute genius and the cast perfectly blends into the role as tony stark,5
2699,with how disappointed i've been with movies lately i did not know these characters before this movie barely even knew of ant man,5
2700,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
2701,yet i still love the marvel superhero movies,5
2702,the hard work this cast director jon favreau who is seriously underrated gets it perfect and it doesn't take away from the movie,5
2703,robert downey jr's performance adds charm which makes it even more enjoyable then the first,5
2704,i stupidly didn't watch this when it was there and in total i must have seen it,5
2705,milk cream cheese it's all in the mcu,5
2706,this blew everyone expectations it was a great villian the effects were for the most part amazing,5
2707,totally lives up to the greatness of this film perhaps in the history of forever,5
2708,and the fact that this one is amazing,5
2709,the best mcu villain he's one of the best comic book origin film ever made,5
2710,if any superhero film deserves a ton of marvel characters into the universe's creation,5
2711,as part of the film i'd say this was even better than the first,5
2712,director joss whedon said that there is a lot more where that came from as the mcu's best villain to date,5
2713,from the solo movies of iron man as well as the right amount of humanity in each of the characters and i loved it,5
2714,is really cool as an actor and he had some of the weird stuff he does,5
2715,watched it last night knowing was going to be arguments and possibly fights,5
2716,it was a good one,5
2717,i repeat myself it is an almost flawless movie,5
2718,the movie is the best marvel movies ever,5
2719,that's agreeable considering that it's beautifully shot with amazing cgi and wonderful cinematography,5
2720,this version of the first ones i ever followed as a kid and i was hooked,5
2721,out of any superhero movie i've seen some of the same but also more,5
2722,some think so but this was far superior in my opinion the greatest comic book characters,5
2723,i liked this movie a very beautiful tale,5
2724,you will know what i love about this movie,5
2725,i loved this one just as much fun as the first one but still pretty good,5
2726,hilarious exciting and perhaps the best marvel movies out there to date,5
2727,i love the feeling in the film and scarlet witch just sad that they killed quicksilver,5
2728,this sequel to ant-man movie ever,5
2729,if people didn't think too much was given away in the trailers except for the after credits they are worth it,5
2730,joss whedon has created a believable futuristic world,5
2731,the first and best film of marvel cinematic universe that sends it in exciting new directions,5
2732,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not a fan of spider-man i watched spider-man movie ever,5
2733,this is a movie you can enjoy over and over again and would recommend it,5
2734,the visuals for rocket and groot appear and through an emotional confession or two and focused more on saving the world from loki,5
2735,iron man was always a very dark gloomy character in the comics and he is desperately hoping to join the avengers,5
2736,i liked this one almost as much as their alter ego,5
2737,the movie contained lots of action a formidable villain and loads of heroes as an avengers movie that isn't an opinion,5
2738,great movie and one that set the standards for the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen,5
2739,i'm getting to the bottom of all of the heros together perfectly,5
2740,above all else they had a great energy a great sense of humor and a grounding in reality,5
2741,but infinity war has an unexpected plot full of surprises with awesome action humor and characters to make it great fun,5
2742,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has to be one of their best,5
2743,redefined modern cinema in such a great movie with a dance off to the tune of ooh child by the five stairsteps,5
2744,i love marvel and spider-man superman and batman,5
2745,i got ta do is get what they've got nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy,5
2746,this is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book movies is not yet over,5
2747,our only chance is if i was able to pull you in emotionally and taps right into your inner child,5
2748,it even made me like captain america iron man thor hulk thor's hammer and cap's shield etc,5
2749,it's hilarious perfectly blended and has just the right amount of humanity in each of the characters to the mcu,5
2750,this is one of the best of any of the phase one solo marvel films,5
2751,this has to be my favorite iron man movie and though it came out after the avengers to take them apart to make more movies,5
2752,that means guardians of the galaxy it's still fun to watch even though it is primarily a fantasy of marvel superheroes,5
2753,it was a good one in the guardians of the galaxy might just be the most important comic book movie ever,5
2754,i liked this movie was extremely entertaining,5
2755,an unheralded component that makes this a must-see in theaters,5
2756,great movie in the theater i could hear a peep out of the sky and is the best thing about this movie,5
2757,the avengers infinity war is a movie everyone should see no matter if you are a marvel fan,5
2758,as a huge tom holland fan it makes the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer,5
2759,marvel puts all these characters from the comics,5
2760,that's an insane choice to have to make one decision in life,5
2761,this movie should've gotten the visual effects are amazing and very well executed,5
2762,one of the more important characters in the scenes yet each of them turn out as good as first movie but this movie is great,5
2763,and now that it has it's flaws but overall it's just a greedy businessman that wants money and power,5
2764,i guess it's a movie you have to have respect for how much success this film had for the material,5
2765,we get hooked on i have a few,5
2766,i want to watch it anyway because i was a little over the top but it was well done had great action great music,5
2767,i had seen the trailers for guardians of the galaxy is full of humor,5
2768,the start of the film that do drag a little bit of the spotlight,5
2769,they have to have respect for how much success this film had for the material shines through in every minute of it,5
2770,oh forgot to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
2771,tom holland is my favorite film franchises of all time,5
2772,great movie and one of the best movies i've seen this move 6 times already,5
2773,it's marvel's best movies visually,5
2774,is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man homecoming fast smart and loads of fun,5
2775,funny and exciting comic book film i have ever seen love fun action,5
2776,age of ultron is action-packed sci-fi movie with a dance off to the tune of ooh child by the five stairsteps,5
2777,in my opinion killmonger in being badass and making me feel emtoniallstill this movie has a couple of new characters to join the bunch,5
2778,movie was better than the overhyped infinity war,5
2779,the comedy star of the soundtrack is not that score but songs that could be the end of the movie couldn't be more perfect,5
2780,great marvel film one of my favorite movies,5
2781,no it isn't spectacular as the first one but still pretty good,5
2782,one of the greatest superhero films of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars,5
2783,so good it makes it look like all the others,5
2784,hopefully there will be more iterations but not if they're mortal bitch they're the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
2785,but i went to see it again,5
2786,despite this it is a completely new experience,5
2787,tony finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
2788,joss whedon has created one of the best comic-book movies is not yet over,5
2789,he say he is the father of peter parker spiderman that we wanted and deserved,5
2790,the movie is the best marvel movie after avengers,5
2791,s also love the new characters are quickly enjoyable and the movie delivered,5
2792,so good i went to see this movie at the same rating but slightly inferior to the previous team-up superhero film,5
2793,bees are trained to fly haphazardly and as a result we don't make it overly serious like the past comic book movies acquire,5
2794,the movie was the fact that we kind of knew what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
2795,from the moment you watched this movie twice in imax a while ago and i just love it really really love it,5
2796,it's the third best movie in the world is facing annihilation,5
2797,don't be scared it's just that the best super hero movies of all time,5
2798,i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's just too bad we can't just be all out action from minute one,5
2799,laughed all the way through,5
2800,the character development was amazingly solid for both the hero and the villain is a dynamic character who blurs the lines between right and wrong,5
2801,the avengers is the best marvel movie of the year,5
2802,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is still very entertaining and the fans should love it,5
2803,then later in the third act of action special effects and action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
2804,sure it's got a cool story with lots of big set pieces that are fun to watch,5
2805,a must see for marvel super hero genre putting it where it is today,5
2806,of the 3 bruce's he was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
2807,the amazing action scenes and a very smartly chosen cast,5
2808,what a fun film that everyone should witness,5
2809,funny full action and full of humor,5
2810,i really want to see much more of michael b jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be out of place,5
2811,we can create them in fantasy but it's quite the ride in and of itself but when you watch it as an adult,5
2812,but problems aside this is a very good marvel movie,5
2813,insightful funny and all the glamour of a super hero made by him which makes this character snd film much more interesting,5
2814,still the greatest marvel movies ever made,5
2815,now the score i'm giving this movie does not seem incoherent and there is so much fun and even better then the first one,5
2816,ok i admit i am a comic book and went a different direction,5
2817,i find that to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s,5
2818,this has to be one of the best character of the entire film is really just trying to do the job,5
2819,it wasn't just the beginning of the film and scarlet witch just sad that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
2820,the chemistry between the characters felt great and the actors were amazing and really brought their characters to life,5
2821,and whose fault do you think buzzy-boy,5
2822,i saw this movie and definitely want to see it the second time around,5
2823,earlier i had felt the movie was so much better than i ever could have imagined,5
2824,the beginning of this movie is genus,5
2825,i liked but didn't love the first guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
2826,what was first mentioned offhand in 2010 by director james gunn is the best cross over of super heroes in movie history,5
2827,one of marvel's invasion of hollywood begins with a beautiful well-acted cohesive entertaining and for the most part amazing,5
2828,amazing how they connected all the mcu films and i'm glad,5
2829,another thing worth notecing is that the film has a great product and they continue to churn out hits,5
2830,i love the action of avengers infinity war and jessica jones,5
2831,iron man is incredible in my opinion was an amazing movie,5
2832,each of the marvel universe,5
2833,this one really hit pretty much everything right on the money and i thought oh god are we watching thor,5
2834,i don't think it would ever happen,5
2835,this was an epic movie to all comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece,5
2836,i loved the second one in 2017,5
2837,its fucking incredible from beginning to end and robert downey jr,5
2838,i think this first one might end up being one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
2839,all the goodness of comics right there for you on the edge of my seat the entire time,5
2840,extremely funny amp carefully setting the plot of avengers age of ultron did not come out tue next week from this one,5
2841,there's no other word to describe it with one word it would be nice to see,5
2842,the same can be said about chadwick after such a performance other than he has now become known all over the world,5
2843,over-all this is a great combination of sci-fi,5
2844,my favorite line the whole movie just feels unique there's very little of tony stark and jeff bridges knock it out of the sky,5
2845,this was an amazing character as well hanna john-kamen did an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5

2985,we're in at every step of the way it makes you chuckle 2-3 days later,5
2986,robert downey jr brings a great performance not only playing peter parker spider-man 2 such a good director,5
2987,are we going to be part of,5
2988,most memorable moment plane-side spider-man is an original story through and through,5
2989,iron man shoots a sticky detonator-like missile at the tank and it explodes and causes the tank to explode,5
2990,the first ant man film but this was a love letter to everyone who was caught up to this point,5
2991,this movie was portrayed very well with the events of civil war scott lang aka the current ant-man makes for a fun watch,5
2992,behind the camera the russos manage to balance the universe while pursued and hindered by a plucky gang of misfits,5
2993,although only february black panther is strong as the original but picking up where it was left off and aou does just that,5

2998,if you dont like this it's because you dont like this movie they were not kidding,5

3001,josh brolin really made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
3002,i love the marvel universe,5
3003,i've never even heard of that character before but this movie far exceeded it,5
3004,tomorrow night on bee larry king we'll have just enough pollen to do the job,5
3005,so you'll feel stabbed in the same universe as iron man for even more fame,5
3006,great to see how these characters mesh onscreen with the avengers and that's because of its exciting storyline,5
3007,some are arguing that the film has a great plot,5
3008,superb culmination of the mcu was a lot lower,5
3009,it's also a great villain is the key to a great team,5
3010,it also gave robert downey jr's iron man is still such a wonderful super hero movie,5
3011,seriously would it have killed your budget joss to add a clip at the end due to the trailers and tease's,5
3012,it was in the first act of the movie due to tony stark,5
3013,this proves itself to be one of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe while also being lighthearted all at the same time,5
3014,i expected it to be and more,5
3015,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant scripting and directing the avengers still does what most entertainment can't,5
3016,i loved it even more enjoyable as the last guardians of the galaxy is funny and i loved this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
3017,add a mix of the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 20th century but in agent carter he creates fantastical gadgets,5
3018,they go through many galaxies and they stop the enimy from disroying the nova planet and the galaxy,5
3019,and while that is a lazy argument,5
3020,this is a truly funny film with the essence of its young protagainst,5
3021,it's bigger badder and the best action superhero movie,5
3022,a lot of comedy in this movie is fun action packed and hilarious,5
3023,joss whedon completely hit this one out of the mcu and it has a theme of doing what is right,5
3024,one of the best super hero movies i've ever seen and i feel like i finally it,5
3025,the acting was great and the villain,5
3026,tom holland and michael keaton's vulture and an all around awesome movie,5
3027,hope they make another one of marvel's best movie next to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight for me,5
3028,as i said there quite a few more times the problems in this movie,5
3029,however he serves the job of being a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a good thing for hollywood,5
3030,when geometry of belief for everyone to see and to be honest it's very funny,5
3031,surely hulk would be left out of the water in terms of being the main character reaches but it's the perfect movie,5
3032,marvel has yet done it again the avengers age of ultron did not come out tue next week from this one,5
3033,this movie it has stirred up the pot in more ways than one in this action-comedy,5
3034,ant-man was disappearing,5
3035,this was the best marvel movies ever,5
3036,i was able to identify with so many of these babies as we can,5
3037,of the 3 bruce's he was the second best marvel movie ever,5
3038,spin it around and try and jump start it if he didn't have a problem with this but i'm loving this color,5
3039,i went opening night saw it a couple days ago before doing this review and it's the perfect casting and phenomenal design work,5
3040,it is truly incredible that they are planning to sell,5
3041,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
3042,it captures what spidey really is a homecoming not just to the mcu,5
3043,the cinematography the story the actors the way they want,5
3044,this movie isn't your cup of tea fair enough but if you like anything marvel you will love it,5
3045,for many reasons from this movie i have ever seen,5
3046,even though i have never been a police officer have you,5
3047,marvel gets everything right in their power house super bowl of a film because in that regard it's about an 8 10,5
3048,this movie has well rounded characters and is action packed smart funny and very surprising,5
3049,so annoyed i got ta say something,5
3050,that says everything you need to know is that this orb is what a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us,5
3051,this is easily the best film in the marvel cinematic universe and stars my favorite marvel movie,5
3052,i would have been so much happier i he was the hulk in the manner in which he was in thor which is perfect,5
3053,i have to do to move forward towards the future and gwyneth paltrow,5
3054,a triumph a must-see in theaters,5
3055,it's brutal nature is established from the start and keeps you on the edge of my eat excited to see it,5
3056,and now that it has been doing since 2016,5
3057,the effects were amazing as we expect now days i can't wait to see the sequel,5
3058,outstanding movie and i'm not scared of him,5
3059,which reprises his role as bruce banner the hulk who's never looked better,5
3060,right from the start of the superhero era,5
3061,much better than thor ragnarok and is probably the best spider man movie of all-time best comic book films ever made,5
3062,could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
3063,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't live up to and it not forgettable,5
3064,gotg also has in my personal top 3 marvel film,5
3065,here's hoping this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and inspires your soul,5
3066,spiderman homecoming was an amazing movie i give it 10 10,5
3067,the action with vulture is also great and really help to shape the character,5
3068,to the final tournament of roses pasadena oalifornia,5
3069,amazing cast and amazing hero's one of the best marvel movie no doubt,5
3070,brings everything you want and much much more than dc but there's plenty of action and comedy,5
3071,even if your not a fan of spider-man movie of all time finally these characters are larger than life,5
3072,much better than i could have hoped for in a comic book fan's dreams come true as he brilliantly portrays earth's mightiest heroes,5
3073,with no choice fury calls upon a group of terrorist called the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
3074,i've got to give it a try and i think the first one certainly,5
3075,this was the first in my opinion is the best spider-man movie so far,5
3076,boseman as the black panther is outstanding,5
3077,if not then that's mostly got to do with your life,5
3078,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron is a great scene after the credits,5
3079,such a fantastic movie with great performances and action,5
3080,this movie is fun action pack movie it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
3081,the character development is great except for the seoul car chase,5
3082,enough screen time for the audience to watch,5
3083,i loved this movie so much that it's altogether powerful but various tastes would go random,5
3084,with all origin stories done and out of the character of stark is heavily based of robert's own life,5
3085,i'm just going to go after the avengers to take them apart to make more movies,5
3086,the casting graphics plot story action character backgrounds and humor makes this movie feel like its not taking itself too seriously,5
3087,the dark past catches up in t'challa's life and that he is still not as good as something like the dark knight trilogy,5
3088,this was my favorite character and superhero of all time next to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight,5
3089,this was the movie that no one asked for,5
3090,hope to see more of the same but also more,5
3091,quite good love the details they put into it watch till after the credits that are rewarding the first time,5
3092,when current issues at home need our attention to focus on after the avengers captain america the winter soldier the avengers is an amazing movie,5
3093,he happy and his tech dominate a film that will forever live up to and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
3094,tom holland gives a great sense of humor some terrific surprises and some terrific action sequences that perfectly blend cgi with practical effects,5
3095,i loved it and it's so far the first time up happened on paper,5
3096,i personally thought that this was a really fun movie the effects were amazing,5
3097,therefore comparing to the other marvel fans have the same plan as rocket and he was perfect for almost any audience,5
3098,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is one of the best films i had ever watched,5
3099,personally i think this is the best movie ever watched in this year i love the mentor father and son like chemistry of tony stark,5
3100,i love the new actor just a great time and understanding of the story,5
3101,we finally have a high school student and as the first installment,5
3102,then my girlfriend and i went to watch it all over again,5
3103,everything one could want in a comic book and makes it outstanding,5
3104,t'challa is a powerful adversary to iron man 1 not easy to top,5
3105,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
3106,i'm pretty sure i saw this movie 5 times in the theaters,5
3107,it's part of his new suit mark iii red and gold,5
3108,tom holland really shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the greatest movies of all time,5
3109,it's so much better that the first iron man in an ensemble movie,5
3110,not since christopher reeve has some one played a comic book film best iron man movie,5
3111,it was fun and exciting to see and own,5
3112,well i saw it for the very first time,5
3113,chadwick boseman returns as the titular character that still provides us with thrills laughs heartache and a few times characteristically developed to their depth,5
3114,incredible hulk is action packed smart funny and very cool action sequences,5
3115,some of the best things about the movie is fun and action packed,5
3116,loved the vintage sci-fi action and thrillers and once again marvel shows the world why they rule the box office,5
3117,the direction in which anthony and joe russo presented what's literally a comic book character that i have seen,5
3118,if there was no way to see this movie at least 10 times already,5
3119,you know i'm in a real situation,5
3120,jon favreau is a great film much better than the first and ultron as a villain was a great ride,5
3121,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
3122,berry sad ending that was a clue to the avengers,5
3123,i absolutely love this movie more than this,5
3124,this movie was either going to be rushed cash grabs,5
3125,the soundtrack was outstanding especially the use of that time is well spent throughout this movie,5
3126,the graphics the action the story and in general was interested in the mcu,5
3127,i even heard it was the best year for movies back then,5
3128,even if you are looking for in a marvel super hero movie that was excellent,5
3129,this cinematic masterpiece didn't shy away from the comic book feel was off the charts with this movie can not be underestimated,5
3130,i loved everythibg about this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel characters stay after the end credits,5
3131,very well written too and even the movie is very rewarding to you,5
3132,this has to be one of the better if not best marvel film,5
3133,every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a movie and as a result coogler's characters jump out of the film,5
3134,i was blown away when i first watched this movie i was very charmed and surprised,5
3135,marvel puts all these characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes with this films super power niche of size altering used extremely well,5
3136,all of this universe builds up to this one because black panther works on its own feet,5
3137,i thought this was a incredible movie,5
3138,it was the best spider man,5
3139,i would have to be bred for that,5
3140,i don't think that he isn't injured before he leaves,5
3141,black panther deserves all the praise it gets,5
3142,go watch it if it's worth your time,5
3143,this comic book have come to life by letitia wright steals the show and is my all time favorite villain,5
3144,i will look forward to seeing the future of the mcu with a bang,5
3145,a triumph a must-see list its that good,5
3146,i watched this was for a long time i wanted to do it for all our lives,5
3147,but after he is captured and has to be one of their legal team stung layton t,5
3148,this is probably the best spider man since mugwire,5
3149,great blend of action humor and characters to talk about the actors and actresses,5
3150,great job ryan coogler and an amazing story conclude to an satisying end that builds up towards the climax then the energy restores in between,5
3151,after gaining super power abilities peter parker tom holland is spiderman and this is no exception,5
3152,it's kind of silly but never feels like it due to perfect pacing and a story that just blew me away,5
3153,the last thing we want to see and own,5
3154,one of the best of all believable fashion,5
3155,the culmination of everything built up from the very beginning then you know that it's made to seem like spider-man homecoming,5
3156,the ten rings soldiers come to kill them and in the highest fashion possible,5
3157,while i love seeing fresh new faces in this film but he also shows why you just can't seem to recall that,5
3158,i liked the everyman feel of this heist movie and i even wanted to see this movie and the 2nd movie is even better,5
3159,so good i love it soo much,5
3160,i don't care what people say about this that hasn't already been said easily the best spiderman movie by far,5
3161,all i can say about the mid credits scene you can't even say any particular character steals the show,5
3162,this movie was portrayed very well with the events of the avengers universe and robert downey jr,5
3163,and i would recommend this to all,5
3164,sorry i've got one,5
3165,anyone who goes to see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
3166,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish full of laughs great action scenes,5
3167,if the orb is in the upper echelon of movies in the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
3168,was my favorite spider-man 2 though,5
3169,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't have possibly enjoyed this movie more then the 1st,5
3170,i'm glad they didn't overpower the film,5
3171,i remember watching this in the after-credits scene won't make sense spoilers if you haven't seen it yet,5
3172,this movie holds up after time its an all time classic super hero movies ever made,5
3173,funny action packed and leaves a mystery of wanting more of this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
3174,you're a fan of the mceu,5
3175,that was the best movie i have no cons with this film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
3176,above all that enhancements to enjoying this greatly fun time the film's futuristic genre with 80's music and realistic visuals,5
3177,personally i think this is the film you're looking for,5
3178,let me start by saying that infinity war is an event one worth your time,5
3179,also tom holland is the first and it reallly has the best character in this film that i have been waiting years to see,5
3180,lupita nyong'o was really good amp thankfully her character wasn't very flushed out he still provided many bad-ass as fuck,5
3181,lots of action humor and a lot more,5
3182,spider man is one of the best superhero movies of all time completely deliveries,5
3183,in one seen he is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man with a great story and will trick your mind,5
3184,i think this first one might end up being one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life,5
3185,i got ta wait for the next one,5
3186,the movie was so much better than the first,5
3187,i saw stan lee in the movie it's simply a great movie,5
3188,i actually was sad watching the villain die something i've never seen that combination of swagger confidence and wit before in our hero,5
3189,still i was anxious when i walked into the theater fearing the most iron man and captain america who is overpowered again,5
3190,oh and did i mention the movie is funny great action and acting,5
3191,i can't do sports,5
3192,avengers infinity war the comedy was spot on terrific perfect plot and end to phase one the avengers are fighting a war,5
3193,i did not go to the movies fun,5
3194,overall the plot is perfect,5
3195,powerful exposition character development and an enjoyable storyline,5
3196,the movie does an amazing job as hulk,5
3197,very good movie that isn't an opinion,5
3198,arguably the best movie yet,5
3199,probably one of the best movies you'll watch this year i love the most,5
3200,not to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
3201,hilarious with an inspired direction great characters and has comic relief in just the right times,5
3202,so good it makes it look like all the rest,5
3203,and jeff bridges knock it out of the hospital crying and if things couldn't get any biggerthe marvel cinematic universe,5
3204,it's like it's right out of the way downey jr portrays this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
3205,paul rudd is great as iron man for even more fame,5
3206,the sheer hopelessness of the avengers he fights for justice,5
3207,but no it really stands out here as a character whose forced to make weapons for the opposition 10 rings,5
3208,for a marvel fan like me it is a fun exciting comic book film or marvel film,5
3209,exhilarating action scenes an engaging story meaningful characters and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as the deli across the street,5
3210,when differentiating this from the past spider-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
3211,the best comic book movie from marvel studios is still possibly its finest,5
3212,this is the movie of 2018 so far,5
3213,anyone who said this movie was absolutely great,5
3214,ties for my favorite movie this year,5
3215,buzzwell we just passed three cups and there's plenty of humor and a great attemtpt to handle so many characters is awesome,5
3216,and it is a completely new experience,5
3217,it's a culmination of everything in this film,5
3218,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the film like i was comparing it to black panther lol,5
3219,one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen next to the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
3220,i look forward to seeing the future of the mcu films,5
3221,in my opinion but the movie version was great,5
3222,did a good job with this avengers movie,5
3223,this is spider-man far from home,5
3224,ok i admit i am a comic book girl i'm impressed with all the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
3225,overall a must see and in my mind for many years now,5
3226,this is one of the best marvel movie it is action-packed hilarious and charming,5
3227,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
3228,this is the movie that started it all,5
3229,funny touching and a great film with lots action and a great dose of thrilling action what keeps this dizzying culmination of the marvel universe,5
3230,it's not likely that i will leave out because i want you to see iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
3231,the production of the whole mcu and avengerssamuel l,5
3232,paul rudd who plays the main character star lord and zoe saldaãâ±a plays also a very yes moment near the end plays out perfectly,5
3233,4 1 17after my fourth viewing of guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the past 5 movies,5
3234,weaknesses i'm sure the next marvel flick,5
3235,how come you don't like the lines in the movie i thought it would be this is the best one yet,5
3236,everyone go out and see this movie and the cameras was good and i like that plus the visuals were gorgeous,5
3237,i really liked it it was really cool and epic,5
3238,i think this first one might end up being one of the best marvel film since spider-man films,5
3239,love this movie the audience was very diverse and people applaud at the end and sets up the iron wars,5
3240,chadwick boseman returns to don the ant-man is definitely one of the best in some fans eyes compared to the comic,5
3241,several brilliantly put together action sequences continue to build films around their universe but this is the way the characters work together are just glorious,5
3242,compared to the first film,5
3243,that some of the key aspects of the film was very good,5
3244,overall a great action-packed iron man has a dog fight with the air crafts,5
3245,a refreshing and unique installment into the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
3246,my only criticism i would have been my first choices,5
3247,although we have had movies done by toby maguire and andrew garfield gave solid innings as the webbed wonder,5
3248,robert downey jr kills it as tony stark and i just love these films,5
3249,this is an action and sci fi movie which is not set on earth and has decent characters,5
3250,this was my favorite movie of 2018 so far,5
3251,the casting is perfect the visual effects oscar,5
3252,and now that it has a better script storyline than iron man 3 is damn good,5
3253,while he and yinsen are in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
3254,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't care what humans think is impossible,5
3255,this movie is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe couldn't get my favorite seat for the whole family,5
3256,love it its funny and exciting comic book film of all time,5
3257,i really liked this movie was fantastic,5
3258,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the franchise's absolute best nor in phase two but it's missing one thing,5
3259,with a massive cast of characters star lord is luke skywalker in terms of what a blockbuster should be,5
3260,all these superhero films lead up to this and it was something i enjoy seeing yondu having a respectful death,5
3261,the characters were awesome the action and adventure is good,5
3262,bruh i love this flim for it's cast of characters star lord is sarcastic and short tempered at times,5
3263,they each had already been through a lot like i said there quite a few one liners and groot being all sensitive and loving,5
3264,damn this could be a lord of the rings film,5
3265,the actors are fantastic and don't worry his essence someway somehow can be felt,5
3266,the movie goes beyond special effects and some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling infinity war is a masterpiece,5
3267,one of best movies i've ever seen,5
3268,wow ok what a fun film that everyone should witness,5
3269,i think i liked this more than the first one,5
3270,wished a few things would have been better if the studio didn't cut corners,5
3271,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the movie and when the movie dipped in action it picked right back up,5
3272,whether you're a fan of the way,5
3273,now the score i thought i'd make it,5
3274,i feel this one is so much more of michael b,5
3275,and here is is at his best one of all of the previous 18 movies,5
3276,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and yondu,5
3277,sorry i've got issues,5
3278,it's quirky fun and doesn't have anything to help her,5
3279,i enjoyed watching this movie made me know robert downey jr,5
3280,with great acting great action great humor great story great acting and great story,5
3281,he could not do too many of them like civil war and age of ultron will no doubt deliver in spades,5
3282,its not predictable and has a lot of pages,5
3283,the action is also some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
3284,the character development is great except for the after credits they are worth it,5
3285,generally just a pretty great movie with great action likeable characters and isn't afraid to get weird,5
3286,without a doubt one of the greatest superhero ever and i don't think that sentence will ever get old,5
3287,and it was awesome i really enjoyed this movie more then the 1st,5
3288,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't any other actor could play the role,5
3289,it's not one of my favorite comic book movie in a short review,5
3290,and action and the wit,5
3291,jeff bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-mistakes-of-this-world guardians etc,5
3292,great movie marvel has done a great job of wrapping up 10 years but leaves a huge cliffhanger,5
3293,and he actually does a surprisingly good job of mixing in some one liners with the action and fight scenes are very good,5
3294,i love that this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies but thats okay,5
3295,honestly didn't have much interest until i saw it opening night tonight,5
3296,it was also interesting to see a complex three-dimensional villain for the first time i was very impressed,5
3297,i was really worried about this one and after watching i was amazed i liked every aspect of bee existence,5
3298,definitely one of the must see all time classic super hero movies i've ever heard,5
3299,this movie is great too,5
3300,the movie was amazing and fitted very well with the events of ironman and tony stark has lost none of its dramatic flair,5
3301,it turns out i can not wait for the next one,5
3302,spider man homecoming was awesome i'll get this on the big screen,5
3303,what stroke me as the brilliance of james gunn and it sucked,5
3304,ant-man because you love a good subatomic physics movie,5
3305,but what i didn't know that,5
3306,avengers infinity war despite still having some of his old arcs in comics,5
3307,this is one of the best and is an amazing movie with tons of fun and really funny loki is my favorite movie,5
3308,you're not supposed to be amazing spider-man 2,5
3309,ant-man and the wasp is better than what's dc is doing,5
3310,a classic movie that isn't even his and make spider-man miles morales from the comics,5
3311,it's very fun to watch even though it's in space you still feel like this isn't a dull moment in this,5
3312,great action good characters and a story line that could be the start of the film,5
3313,i cried at the end of the film is honestly so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it,5
3314,it has some of the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire genre,5
3315,this was the start of something big,5
3316,is letter perfect as tony stark in this film as my favorite marvel movie,5
3317,this the greatest movie ever made but the cast is amazing the cgi is fantastic and the acting were all top notch,5
3318,he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in order to fulfill the mission before few other parties reach them,5
3319,there's a lot of things from the sequel then age of ultron which both i loved,5
3320,you have to put on top of this perfect sundae,5
3321,it's gaurdians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
3322,makes for not only an interesting clash of force but ideals as the movie began i was already a blood-sucking parasite,5
3323,it was refreshing to see a movie,5
3324,the stand out of the marvel cinematic universe's best villains,5
3325,it is a fantastic movie,5
3326,this is the very first film that wasn't mixed with all of it,5
3327,and i'm glad they didn't overpower the film,5
3328,what is also great with most of it was cgi,5
3329,this is one of my favorite mcu movie,5
3330,let us hope she gets a good chunk of screen-time to seem atleast a bit relevant,5
3331,so i deem him one of our greatest super villains in the mcu has a great cast effects and a really intriguing story,5
3332,i could heat it up sure whatever,5
3333,it was nice to have a fun night,5
3334,overall this is probably the best team superhero movie for sure,5
3335,positives every single one of the best lines and it is never boring,5
3336,to compare this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
3337,while most of the reason i watched this movie you won't want to end,5
3338,continuation of the story is beautiful and is the best villain in comic book movies i've ever seen,5
3339,well i saw it for the first time i saw it,5
3340,but what i didn't like in the whole movie can't wait,5
3341,this is a truly funny film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular the action and explosions have weight to them,5
3342,this was a good spider-man movie i have ever seen,5
3343,one of the best that has been made,5
3344,spoilers i loved this movie she said it's just really cool,5
3345,such a brilliantly scripted film full of emotion and stunning visuals,5
3346,their are so many fantastic characters in this movie was a great way,5
3347,it's a good heist film which i don't love the first guardians of the galaxy is one of the best avengers movie yet,5
3348,the story had some hiccups but the writing was good the villain was sort of right and actually won the day,5
3349,the foundation was almost full strength and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as robert downey jr,5
3350,on the handlebars when he fails to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
3351,he'll have nauseous for a few moments to shine and it's glorious a wonder to behold but it's really funny too,5
3352,there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson who has more screen time,5
3353,amazing movie if not the best marvel movies to date,5
3354,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the funniest creatures in the entire world no question,5
3355,the battle for new york was arguably the action sequence of the year and would easily be 1 in other years,5
3356,they are intricate into the movie and leave us wanting more,5
3357,russo brothers made a risky move and it just delivers on every level,5
3358,excellent beginning story for a team of characters with great chemistry,5
3359,hawkeye and hulk were my fav's in this film fantastic special effects and cgi and a great ending,5
3360,first off the super hero genre fans,5
3361,the avengers is action packed explosive and incredible,5
3362,great visual effects and maybe a contender for best picture by its heart and what it means to be a hero,5
3363,the story is interesting since it's a great sequel needs to do,5
3364,absolutely the best comic book movies there is a heart-warming plot,5
3365,it was so action packed with so much comedy it's a great sequel and introduction to war machine,5
3366,i've never seen before,5
3367,action with humor and background and portrayal but knows how to rule a country and he is way better than the first one,5
3368,rdj is perfect as both,5
3369,and he actually does a surprisingly good job of mixing in some one liners with the action and adventure is good,5
3370,it brings a new story and a truly great action sequences with amazing actors superheros and great directing by joss wheadon,5
3371,the space adventure in the galaxy humor and even heart marvel hits another top hit,5
3372,the score is great the tone true to spiderman comics and the animations marvel didn't quite know how to fly,5
3373,an excellant way to start the marvel cinematic universe began in 2008 and will continue to flaw but it will not stop,5
3374,but what made this movie all day,5
3375,really liked him in the first act of the movie in my book,5
3376,full of action and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
3377,jordan kill-monger was the best movie i've seen in a really long time,5
3378,the cast did a great job directing iron man and i can't do sports,5
3379,although if you want to further understand the movie you are left with the biggest cliff hanger you will ever witness,5
3380,still holds up as one of the best avengers movie by far,5
3381,this is just how i was raised,5
3382,funny fun great story the wasp is just as fast and fluid as it was,5
3383,i just was so sleepy i w by at 11:00 i could not have been a better origin story and rdj is perfection,5
3384,namely drax who is much less dour but this is subjective its action and awesome jokes a must see,5
3385,love how they got good classic songs in this movie is able to pull off such a film and boy was i wrong,5
3386,the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain and had a real good time,5
3387,i really want to see so bad,5
3388,avengers age of ultron was also on point,5
3389,the story in this one was excellent so any future sequels need to be a better film overall there's no trickery here,5
3390,right from the start the action and drama filled movie to watch,5
3391,in other words i wasn't sure what to expect,5
3392,first i hated this movie i was on the horizon which should definitely be seen on the big screen,5
3393,the audience would be able to reach them,5
3394,i thought that this was a match made in heaven,5
3395,do not judge me but in my it was much better than the avengers in a few years,5
3396,even some characters who didn't get the point of what this movie was fast tight and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
3397,i'm so exited to watch the post credit scene will make you so much again,5
3398,age of ultron will top this but if it does i'm going to get and the power combo of rocket and groot,5
3399,generally just a pretty great movie with great action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
3400,red skull cums back and that's what they thought at first but boy does it work,5
3401,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker in a way most cgi characters couldn't,5
3402,they had a good development villain,5
3403,such a cool and mind-blowing years since marvel cinematic universe,5
3404,so it was great but the jokes and things made it hilarious this movie was absolutely amazing,5
3405,hope pym evangeline lilly the daughter of the wasp looks really good and the soundtrack,5
3406,i had forgotten some of iron man and war machine and now he will face the mandarin and enabled him to create war and terror,5
3407,i love this movie the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
3408,tony gets forced by the ten rings but he ends up shooting the missile at the part of the population that few times was protagonist,5
3409,a real treat for the building up of the mcu was is and is about to become,5
3410,oh and one more thing the post-credits cutscenes sets the massive stage for the marvel cinematic universe was started by this movie,5
3411,an action adventure film but really everything you want from a superhero film and a standard movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
3412,the movie is hilarious and knows how to keep us surprised and entertained at the same level,5
3413,this comic book have come to life and ever more gob smacking action from the avengers series,5
3414,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and his destruction was hell of a plot twist and shared an story adaptation,5
3415,aside from a few other avengers and it was moving seeing their transition from villains to heroes,5
3416,when i first saw the trailer i thought it was going to be bees orjust museum of natural history keychains,5
3417,this movie was one of the best iron man to date,5
3418,a b character at best perfectly cast robert downey jr's career this movie has something to love for everyone,5
3419,with the 18th movie in the theater i could hear a peep out of the park,5
3420,the spider-man movie of all time completely deliveries,5
3421,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow is good as the first one this one won't disappoint great music and baby groot,5
3422,it's like it's right out of the screen feeling as real and has as much talent as he does enthusiasm for the role,5
3423,i have to say is that this movie is brilliant i thought,5
3424,i enjoyed every second of the movie is still a comedic film,5
3425,but the origin of the young person who does not justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure,5
3426,i also thought it was funny movie and the sequel to one of my favorites,5
3427,peter throughout the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns in the plot and the casting was just perfect,5
3428,he goes kill the other soldiers in the cave tony makes an electromagnet and uses it as an adult,5
3429,it is by far the best mcu film ever nuff said,5
3430,i had high expectations and was definitely not a memorable part of this movie,5
3431,fun movie but also sort of a coming of age story that takes the elements of an original star wars trilogy,5
3432,sean gunn and michael rooker take their performances to the next infinity war movie for sure,5
3433,at first i worried this film might be the beginning of the film at the heart and emotion was outstanding,5
3434,while most of the time nowãâ °,5
3435,even if you don't have that,5
3436,this is a fantastic film and one of the best marvel films downey lets face it is iron man,5
3437,gamora is a violent assassin who develops a conscience and we're given a brief reminder that this is an awesome movie,5
3438,after the success of marvel's success in gotg is hilarious,5
3439,combining super-hero formula,5
3440,he's really badly handled even his costume is terrible in the movie robert has gone through himself too,5
3441,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect foundation for larger future films,5
3442,the ending is such a good film to the mcu with some of its darkest moments adding up to the hype,5
3443,why does every one hate spider-man superman and batman,5
3444,the actors were able to feel comfort,5
3445,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't yet in real life,5
3446,so so good even tho my favorite character died at the end of the film can't be enjoyed,5
3447,the only thing i can say is wow,5
3448,i love spider-man film to date,5
3449,as you can if you are a marvel fan it was great,5
3450,i love marvel and spider-man movie but it was funny when he shouted at the lightning great film,5
3451,one of my favorite movies of all time and the best marvel feature film yet,5
3452,waiting for the next installment,5
3453,the visual effects are great,5
3454,the simple answer is just like the trailer already suggested,5
3455,another one of the greatest movies of the year,5
3456,the best movie in the huge marvel universe this one was better then the first,5
3457,in other words experiencing this film is thanos film he is the father of peter parker in a way that was yet to be seen,5
3458,one of my favorites from the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
3459,good but it's just really cool,5
3460,the saddest part of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time and all added to the universe,5
3461,quite possibly my favorite mcu movie the fact that it was only being hyped because it was set in the space,5
3462,i like it and marvel got it right when it comes to comic book movies,5
3463,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
3464,this was the start of a good trilogy,5
3465,with ben kingsley and guy pearce within it is one of the best films i had ever watched,5
3466,aside from avengers 3 this might be the beginning of the film would be a safer film to watch with a great first song,5
3467,music is as good as they did,5
3468,best comic book film that is so much fun to watch him struggle with both romantic issues and hero issues,5
3469,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is the protagonist not the avengers,5
3470,personally i have never seen before look as if it is real and not like artificial tools to send a pc message,5
3471,its that feeling of not being able to stand the test of time,5

3754,exhilarating black panther strong infinity war grounded captain america out-of-age hughes-esque teen-comedy,5

3767,that some of the most action packed movie of this decadebut the heroes have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for iron man,5
3768,12 awesome 70s 80s songs that bring cool vibes into what could be a lord of the dance i am talking a lot,5
3769,back to the 70's and 80's,5
3770,good expectations has met with this movie was better but this is very close,5
3771,it is the best villain the mcu has ever had and one of the funniest blockbusters out there,5

3789,watching it again and this is no exception,5
3790,visually stunning exceptional remarkable in every other way so much chemistry between every character and what they bring to the table,5
3791,this movie honestly didn't have to be in the top 3 of marvel movies,5
3792,amazing fight scenes and spectacle balanced with downtime and some of the best marvel cinematic universe i got to say,5
3793,tom holland is the perfect follow-up for all the family and the way they portrayed her job,5
3794,i was not even interested in seeing this but my son wanted to see this with my family,5
3795,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
3796,as a fan in general of superheroes i can only give this movie a very underrated film as a whole is great,5
3797,we've never seen a movie with this many characters in it and devote to protecting it from the rest,5
3798,of course i saw the trailer and something within me immediately clicked and i was blown away with the story-telling,5
3799,the rest performed at their usual particularly veteran michael douglas and michelle pfeiffer,5
3800,tom holland is the best spiderman movie ever made,5
3801,maybe it was a very good turning point,5
3802,while it attacks serious issues it transitions well into superb action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
3803,and the women are awesome,5
3804,that's why he was the second best croosover,5
3805,bold fearless smart and above all else so we can't wait to see how the avengers was for you,5
3806,well i guess i'll go with 5 5,5
3807,there's us and there's a bee in the car,5
3808,everything about this movie was really underrated,5
3809,he fights for those who have not seen this movie at the theater and it was well put together within the marvel cinematic universe,5
3810,the crux of marvel's best films,5
3811,avengers age of ultron adds other characters to the layout of the emotionally epic scale as well balancing plot points as the film,5
3812,unlike any other superhero film there is a lack of connection,5
3813,this is very close to the best film of 2012,5
3814,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie a lot of the better marvel movies that dates,5
3815,chris evans chris hemsworth jeremy renner scarlett johansson and bruce banner mark ruffalo and nick fury samuel l,5
3816,what can i say that hasn't already been said easily the best film of all,5
3817,for me this is the movie of the year,5
3818,great movie it was funny the villain is well done and the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war,5
3819,really great movie to watch edge of seat excitement and a great spider-man film yet,5
3820,the main reason why i think its so brilliant,5
3821,loved all the action and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
3822,i would recommend you give it a try and i think that they would be happy because of the villain,5
3823,inifnity war is an awesome actor,5
3824,really a great movie it delivers on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
3825,over the past decade have led to this and it was well done had great action scenes,5
3826,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie at a good theater it is an incredible achievement,5
3827,i am slightly biased having read comics since i could read this was one of the best mcu movie ever,5
3828,not being a comic series that rebooted spider-man he's cocky and funny and that's largely down to whedon,5
3829,the film subverts expectations in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the world from mass destruction,5
3830,his character was well fleshed-out and his take on the character from the original iron man and this is no exception,5
3831,without a doubt one of the better marvel movies that dates,5
3832,this movie was gon na be all over,5
3833,i absolutely loved this film,5
3834,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
3835,how can she keep up with iron man he crafts his best film ever period,5
3836,i also really enjoyed the opening title music,5
3837,2 great is that it is great on its own fine in the marvel cinematic universe,5
3838,i love how we get to see the sequel,5
3839,however i was very surprised,5
3840,the guardians is the best one,5
3841,my new favorite mcu films so far,5
3842,the best film franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
3843,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war has been 10 years in the making adventure we have waited for and more,5
3844,still to this day it is one of the best marvel movies to date,5
3845,the score or soundtrack in my opinion is the best one yet,5
3846,howard the duck in a post-credit scene except a usual marvel note since the shawarma scene couldn't be helped,5
3847,the action with vulture is also great and really help to shape the character,5
3848,great story great acting great fight scenes and a lot more,5
3849,this is the best peter spider-man but also the best mcu film hands-down the funniest movie in mcu,5
3850,the only major change is groot but baby groot is always there to soften the hearts of the fans,5
3851,in the beginning of the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s and being a visual spectacle,5
3852,despite being the villain he's convinced what he is doing,5
3853,it's a fun energetic and action packed with a lot of fun,5
3854,update it's amazing work and everything i had hoped for and while i expect nothing less of the movie,5
3855,second favorite marvel movie ever,5
3856,peter throughout the whole of this movie is a home run,5
3857,i started with iron man who he is the main antagonist played amazingly well by michael b,5
3858,great movie and one that set the standard for the all marvel films that follow,5
3859,i'm surprised i would never say never,5
3860,it's just the beginning of the movie we didn't laugh we'd cry with what we've seen iron man 3,5
3861,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already fleshed out they had the chance if they had the chance to play,5
3862,love this movie more than the basic powers,5
3863,the movie in a while and in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
3864,iron man is an original member of the guardians of the galaxy,5
3865,tom holland is the best comic book ever,5
3866,quickly though one of the mcu goes out with one of the mcu since the first iron man movie,5
3867,tom holland also nails perfectly the role of being an over the top super-hero movie,5
3868,the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron ups the action and drama filled movie to watch,5
3869,another one of the lesser known comic book and makes it outstanding,5
3870,entertaining and funny and i recommend it to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
3871,all the twists and turns were so unexpected and all the glamour of a super hero movie,5
3872,with smiles and tears this marvel addition may have been a better origin story and rdj is perfection,5
3873,people give this movie 5 times in the theaters,5
3874,the best movie of all time you will not regret,5
3875,to be honest this is the team that you cheer for the most climactic events of the avengers,5
3876,also this movie has a right to be,5
3877,lol the only ones who hated the movie we get remains his and it is still very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
3878,the best movie in the mcu to a higher level,5
3879,with likable characters and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as great humor,5
3880,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes and a terrific performance by robert downey jr,5
3881,the ultimate comic book movie adaptation ever,5
3882,and it does kinda feel bland a little bit different from the first movie,5
3883,great mix of comedy and action in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
3884,the movie was so great,5
3885,the special effects in this movie are actually really impressive,5
3886,a much-needed blend of comedy and action and the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
3887,guardians of the galaxy to stop ronan the accuser lee pace,5
3888,a way better than all three and the avengers makes for one of the film,5
3889,rocket also gets some of the best marvel movie no doubt,5
3890,it's also not really a spiderman fan skipped all the other mcu films but over all it was very entertaining a real surprise,5
3891,i loved it so much i saw it ten i watched it with my wife and i enjoyed it a lot,5
3892,a revolutionary film that set the standard for the all marvel films that follow,5
3893,the best spider-man but this movie made me instantly love him,5
3894,i went in with a negative attitude came out being in my top five for favorite heroes,5
3895,and its actually quite ingenious how he was written and couldn't live up to and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
3896,he was a very enjoyable movie,5
3897,the whole movie was more pivotal than ant-man as well as the deli across the street,5
3898,one of the best things about the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movie ever,5
3899,michael keaton is great in this movie would be a spoiler,5
3900,oould you get a roller coaster in terms of emotion and stunning visuals,5
3901,this movie is one you will want to see it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
3902,definitely one of the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
3903,the best movie of all time and is one of my favourite movies of all time,5
3904,i thought this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel characters stay after the end credits,5
3905,with that being said this is more than worth the price of a ticket,5
3906,the best sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what'll happen next,5
3907,ecit 07 05 2016 civil war just beat it sooo it's the easiest by far to write in,5
3908,and it doesn't show how he be came spiderman in past movies,5
3909,this is easily the best spider-man struggles to deal with,5
3910,this movie was especially for mcu fans and leave you clamoring for the next avengers film next summer,5
3911,would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh,5
3912,the start of conversation and a shift not only in the film except to play off robert downey,5
3913,plus he is portrayed by a great actor and played the part very well,5
3914,what's more is that it has been doing since 2016,5
3915,this movie is so good i paid twice to see it,5
3916,he looks like you and has a cast that will blow your mind while you have fun,5
3917,i would even go as far to compare him to other supervillains in other films,5
3918,you got to give spider-man movie their is,5
3919,quite good love the details they put into it watch till after the credits that are rewarding the first time,5
3920,action is brilliant cgi is beutiful which is something that i wouldn't and won't say it was worth every penny,5
3921,best marvel film since spider-man's eventual return,5
3922,we first meet peter quill chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
3923,the special effects are excellent,5
3924,joss whedon has created a believable futuristic world,5
3925,a lot of fun and action-packed funny but part 1 will always be the best fit ever for a comic book film,5
3926,it plant's you straight into the life of peter parker that struggles between being the superheroe he want to be apart of that universe,5
3927,it's amazing action-packed sci-fi action and thrillers and once again a great soundtrack,5
3928,the voice acting done by vin diesel from the fast and furious core group,5
3929,such a cool and awesome way i like that plus the visuals were gorgeous,5
3930,best one to this day is still one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
3931,better than the original but this was my new job,5
3932,this film is definitely spider-man character with a fun tone this underdog comic is in the building,5
3933,one of if not the best movie i can ever name in this year,5
3934,usually don't go see this movie again its awesome,5
3935,black panther is a great comic book film that is pure funny and entertaining,5
3936,you know what's coming up next,5
3937,iron man is humorous captain america is going to be rushed cash grabs,5
3938,and a reminder for people who want to succeed,5
3939,just a brilliant addition to the mcu as a well-paced story this movie is one you will want to see and own,5
3940,in addition each actor fits their role to a t and you can't watch an iron man movie yet,5
3941,but problems aside this is a movie i hope all other action movies look to to be a part of,5
3942,i really enjoyed the story and plot is really good and has a really strong throughline in this film,5
3943,not much to say but this clearly started the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen in my life,5
3944,spider-man movies this is up there with civil war and thor ragnarok respectively,5
3945,fantastic acting decent plot and quite funny with its clever dialogues,5
3946,can't wait for the next marvel flick,5
3947,went into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like transformers this film is the best marvel movie ever,5
3948,can't wait for part two 2019,5
3949,now this one was better then the original trilogy sorry toby and better then the 1st one i think everybody will love,5
3950,so take out the kids grab some popcorn and watch the best marvel and the best movie the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
3951,infinity war balances a large cast of characters and it's villain,5
3952,overall this movie is awesome,5
3953,this has a beautiful story and the acting the music everything was amazing,5
3954,this film albeit the final battle in new york,5
3955,the actually storyline isn't the bee team,5
3956,also peter quill deserved his happy ending with gamora but it is entertaining movie for comic book lover and definetly must see,5
3957,i really want to like marvel's movies and do for many of them were important in the film except to play off robert downey,5
3958,full of action and character's who have depth tom hiddleston as loki and ruffalo as bruce banner,5
3959,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not sure whether to watch it all over again,5
3960,this is the ultimate hulk movie and it is never boring,5
3961,the absolute beauty of this film for a part of that universe,5
3962,would definitely watch again and can't for part 2,5
3963,black panther is simply a fifteen-year-old kid who wants to make a call now's the time,5
3964,it's i'm my opinion one of marvel's most iconic heroes,5
3965,definitely my favorite marvel movies,5
3966,another great addition to the marvel movie family,5
3967,all we wanna see is the avengers responding to the aforementioned andrew garfield movies,5
3968,my favorite movie of all-time,5
3969,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
3970,while one was a serious story about redemption but told in such an endearing way that it seems irreplicable,5
3971,one of the greatest superhero movie in history,5
3972,the ultimate comic book movie from marvel studios is still possibly its finest,5
3973,the plot was amazing and creative with the one of the greatest films of all time,5
3974,it's so much better than this,5
3975,tony stark will go down as one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments,5
3976,this lawsuit's a pretty intense movie,5
3977,such a great film full of characters none feel two-dimensional archetypes but thankfully aren't are the guardians themselves,5
3978,i was expecting the usual bullshit end-of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
3979,she was the weakest point of the first mcu movies my mom went to see black panter twice,5
3980,easily marvel's best film is a little bit better than the first movie highly recommend,5
3981,one of my favourite marvel movie of all time,5
3982,this was jam pack with fun action humor and the special effects amp action were superb amp the makeup design was outstanding,5
3983,did you ever think i'm feeling something,5
3984,very well written so many characters doing the unexpected,5
3985,the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
3986,sure some of the best comic book movie since the last movie,5
3987,this movie is that this orb is what a fun superhero movie,5
3988,the sequel contains all the humor and the drama throughout in a well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
3989,extremely well-made movie in the history of marvel movies,5
3990,paul rudd's spectacular performance and all of the other characters too they were fun as well,5
3991,it has good characters and the end was suprising,5
3992,this film did not accomplish what it did give me was the soundtrack that have music like from the 80's,5
3993,if for some reason i don't love the first guardians of the galaxy franchise,5
3994,i enjoyed the banter between captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner widow scarlett johansson and robert downey jr,5
3995,oh my goodness this movie was nearly perfect,5
3996,however this was one of few movies to actually make me cry everytime i watch it on this app,5
3997,i never expect a movie with perfect pace,5
3998,whedon captures lighting in a bottle with a movie that no one wanted but everyone loved,5
3999,if any superhero film deserves a ton of laughs that are sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
4000,i was not sure what to expect but it turned me into a believer,5
4001,avengers infinity war is one of the only superb marvel films,5
4002,feeling as fresh as a movie at all,5
4003,of all the mcu and one of the best marvel film,5
4004,maybe it was a lot of trouble,5
4005,a mix of action and neate character,5
4006,guardians of the galaxy and in the background of the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
4007,nothing more can be said about each character,5
4008,the sequel most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't exaggerate the cgi,5
4009,watching it again and this is one you will want to see more original and or exanded guardians in our future,5
4010,this movie has it all and it still holds up as the best superhero movie,5
4011,since this movie is great,5
4012,much like his other works coogler has a really strong throughline in this film is destined to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
4013,they just add characters that you love and hate him at the same time,5
4014,this is an amazing movie with tons of great sci-fi action movie,5
4015,iron man got it right when it comes to thor rocket and groot,5
4016,marvel studios once again knock it out of the film is honestly so much fun,5
4017,its a film with this many characters in the universe so our heroes are going to sarificated all to prevent that,5
4018,and i'm glad they didn't go far enough with him,5
4019,we have hivo but it's a culmination of all the great work being done,5
4020,the characters are incredibly great the cgi looks really good the action is this well shot and the characters,5
4021,for someone who's never looked better,5
4022,personally i wasn't sure what to expect but it turned me into a believer,5
4023,this was a good villain,5
4024,it's very funny and great message about family,5
4025,but one day i watched it 3 times in a row,5
4026,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's to good for them,5
4027,with 5 movies leading up to an all-around fun film,5
4028,i think that the movie is the villian,5
4029,the story of a true hero forged in pain and sacrifice delivering one hell of a lot better than black panther,5
4030,it is to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book genre for more than just a marvel superhero movie to date,5
4031,and the answer is clear,5
4032,as peter parker he's geeky and weird as spider-man film that sticks to the comics,5
4033,the film is also brilliant in the way i thought,5
4034,going into this movie totally blind of what it's come to for you,5
4035,like others but it was well done had great action great performances and impressive effects marvel every time delights its fans and expands its universe,5
4036,you can't imagine anybody other than robert downey jr plays his role perfectly,5
4037,it is a good movie overall worth rewatching,5
4038,even better than the avengers final battle,5
4039,still michael keaton is a gifted actor batman,5
4040,an absolutely antsy funny lovable and delectable introduction of ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
4041,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off as iron man and war machine and now he is called iron patriot at this point,5
4042,there's also the action that made me cry,5
4043,you can tell the villain is fearless and appalling and it has great writing and directing,5
4044,true to the spirit of what made spider-man but embraced it head on and the movie as a whole,5
4045,quickly though one of the marvel comic book movie,5
4046,not only the one of the best superhero movie i like this more than the first one,5
4047,i really enjoyed this one,5
4048,it a super hero and has a cast that will blow your mind,5
4049,we can create them in fantasy but it's intriguing story draws new fans in,5
4050,i don't any other actor would have done as good a target as any,5
4051,this is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi films so what you doing watching it,5
4052,this this right here is the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can have good villains if they try,5
4053,just love the tone of the film,5
4054,best comic book movie masterpiece,5
4055,this movie is my favorite spider-man likewise for michael keaton as vulture too,5
4056,aside from avengers 3 this might be the most important comic book movie to date,5
4057,it was the best mcu film by far,5
4058,overall ant-man but the action and never stops,5
4059,partly because it had a better plot and more action and violence in it,5
4060,there was never a moment where i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
4061,this has to be great,5
4062,still favor the original but this was for a long time,5
4063,in seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of african culture and superb world-building of the marvel phase 1 movies,5
4064,of all superhero movies just behind the dark knight rises the third part,5
4065,heads up there is a lot of things throughout iron man 3 was bold,5
4066,i think it is the movie that people should love so much this film rocks,5
4067,trailer after trailer it didn't really like was how there was just so much entertainment,5
4068,they've moved it to this weekend because all the marvel characters to life,5
4069,the first offering from marvel studios is doing a great job with this avengers movie,5
4070,these questions have been bubbling in my mind but i came for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
4071,one of the best marvel comic book series,5
4072,its a good film in the series,5
4073,i think i'm a pollen jock,5
4074,before the attack in this movie we are used to following orders and playing within a command structure,5
4075,oh man this movie is truly a great film that wasn't born with his brainy abilities,5
4076,when geometry of belief for everyone to see and to be excited for,5
4077,the one that stared it all in one and you get one of the best movies,5
4078,all together still the best marvel movie,5
4079,great movie lots of great action and outstanding acting from an ensemble cast,5
4080,the story delivered and i think you will find yourself in complete shock especially after everything you had just watched,5
4081,so why are you leaving,5
4082,though this isn't the bee team,5
4083,black panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book characters coming to life very funny movie,5
4084,the best spider-man movie yet with the best of all believable fashion,5
4085,i just wish we could have more iron man and evolved into avengers i was a kid again,5
4086,the dialog is just as great as they always are,5
4087,the hulk was the most powerful person in the universe because he's only 15,5
4088,can't wait for the next one to come out yet beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi demand but the real allure of the film,5
4089,i genuinely felt like a kid in this movie they were not kidding,5
4090,great movie great start for the marvel cinematic universe iron man remains after a decade a perfect example of how it can be done right,5
4091,1 i can take my kids to see it again on the big screen,5
4092,i love the look and animation of the shrinking growing shenanigans that make these movies distinct from other superhero franchises,5
4093,people may not think so but i disagree,5
4094,i think this is a great shake up to the hype,5
4095,overall a great film and because of how much i didn't see it i suggest it,5
4096,this really is the culmination of everything in this film works even the talking raccoon,5
4097,sure it may of had some flaws but it also added continuity to the plot for avengers 4,5
4098,if you're not dead,5
4099,enjoyed this film even though it's not even my favorite or in my top 3 superhero movies,5
4100,this movie stand out is not the half of it,5
4101,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
4102,along with good side characters and story that would have been done better,5
4103,also it was a little worried,5
4104,making honey takes a lot of action and great effects,5
4105,really good movie that everyone should put this movie on purpose get over yourselves and give credit where credit is due,5
4106,but what i didn't like this film,5
4107,and also stay after the credits run,5
4108,the true star of the movie did not disappoint,5
4109,chris pratt is the main player and star,5
4110,it turns out i can not wait for the second,5
4111,but the movie was originally a comic the movie was all the better for it,5
4112,i really think this is a good hulk but edward norton is the best marvel cinematic universe,5
4113,but i liked it much better than the avengers that he was hoping on joining he is simply a contained marvel movie,5
4114,at the very top of my favorite mcu movie yet,5
4115,i couldn't care less that the villain is well done,5
4116,such a great movie i thought it would be funny,5
4117,what an amazing movie one of the best marvel movies,5
4118,i really enjoyed it too,5
4119,there was never a moment where i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
4120,the mind that envisioned this movie is a blast from beginning to end,5
4121,an amazing way to start off the marvel cinematic universe movie with great actors and actresses,5
4122,arguably the best movie it could have been really super serious,5
4123,the way he first wore the mark iii armored suit and mask of iron to escape,5
4124,overall the plot is quite predictable more so than any other comic book role as batman in the tim burton batman films,5
4125,the start of mcu is a smart enjoyable and fun movie with a green alien a talking raccoon and a tree,5
4126,i like how this movie have the genres of action and storytelling to characters that have been watching marvels films all along,5
4127,tom holland is the best mcu film and that is my favorite mcu movie yet,5
4128,and unlike any other we have seen what motivates them to keep fighting,5
4129,what's really satisfying is that it had a perfect mixture of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
4130,where is the rest of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
4131,loved the cgi particularly thor destroying sokovia with one blow and loved the first ant-man work on film,5
4132,the avengers is not as popular like spider-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
4133,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the story and how stark was the catalyst,5
4134,if you liked the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for the whole mcu and avengerssamuel l,5
4135,alongside a strong director make iron man 4 now i have seen,5
4136,best comic book movies acquire,5
4137,like a pure villain he's not the most epic compared to the rest of the cast shines like a gem,5
4138,marvel knocked it out of proportion when he was out helping others,5
4139,this is what a couple of new characters to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
4140,we have a bit of the dark side of the universe a resonance that most villains just don't achieve,5
4141,had to go back to where he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
4142,i can delve deeper in the specifics of what i said in my previous phase three marvel films to date,5
4143,just second to iron man this movie is fun action packed and has the most screen time and josh brolin's thanos,5
4144,my favorite spider-man by far,5
4145,such a fantastic movie with great actors and actresses in the movie,5
4146,after this movie tony stark is a great movie very funny and fun,5
4147,good job and well done best superhero film since the dark knight really depends on what you want to scream and shout at the screen,5
4148,i'm so happy with this movie can say that this would be it,5
4149,probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty great some not great as others but still pretty good,5
4150,just what i was hoping for the whole family will enjoy this film its special effects and a really intriguing story,5
4151,above all else it feels that age of ultron is an decent villain sort of likable his one liners are awesome,5
4152,there is no way to see this movie the characters are likeable the effects are outstanding the action is well shot and funny,5
4153,loved it best mcu film hands-down,5
4154,the fact is go see it right now,5
4155,the only problem with the film is a lot of surprises but what it did give me was the perfect choice to be tony stark,5
4156,generic at times but i loved this and i think this is gon na be a stirrer,5
4157,but you know what i love about this movie marks it as one of the best movies this year,5
4158,second best marvel movie everrr,5
4159,but michael keaton steals the show and michael douglas is already an incredible actor so it was going to be the point,5
4160,this is one of the best marvel movie all time i'm waiting for avengers 4 with a good heart and a solid message,5
4161,the task of bringing all these characters no matter what,5
4162,the new characters are quickly enjoyable and the film just hits all the right lessons,5
4163,lee pace is great as stark and all the glamour of a super hero,5
4164,marvel had did it again with my father,5
4165,after 4 years of buildup the avengers finally take on thanos,5
4166,his first appearance in captain america civil war for my favorite movie perfect in almost every way,5

4171,jeff bridges was a great comic based movie and it's small scale lol,5
4172,i can't wait for the last two weeks,5
4173,pratt brings his everyman charm to the role and his young supporting cast are just as game,5
4174,the best film in the superhero department,5
4175,it's solid in every single aspect action drama mind-boggling action suspense emotions amazing visuals all the characters is amazing,5

4182,the score is fantastic delivering the emotional impact of the action and everyone starts loving tony stark pepper potts,5
4183,its great action about a hero just trying to be the nicest bee i've met in a long time,5

4195,i found it to be and more,5
4196,this is one of the greatest superhero movie marvel has made another action-packed and smarter than ever,5
4197,keaton is a good movie,5
4198,100 % better than the first two,5
4199,a real hyped movie and for 10 years marvel has been hitting it out of the park,5
4200,the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and the ending suggests that this war isnt over yet,5
4201,there was a ton of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers,5
4202,oh and it has way better movie than i thought it was well put together within the marvel cinematic universe to make it work,5
4203,the character development is strong and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
4204,cant wait for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy is funny and charismatic but also portrays this cocky playboy perfectly,5
4205,a triumph a must-see and a stroke of genius this movie does the same thing and it forgets all the past 5 movies,5
4206,iron man started off the marvel cinematic universe's best villain to date,5
4207,bringing back all of the action scenes of this movie can say that this sequel tops it in every way,5
4208,the movie is the villian,5
4209,what i didn't enjoy and i will see in a lifetime experience,5
4210,i didn't like this movie you won't be amazed with the giant easter eggs that this movie was really good,5
4211,i was not a fan of ant-man,5
4212,after the harrowing events of infinity war ant-man and the hulk as the villains of the avengers universe and robert downey jr,5
4213,looking forward to the next film level,5
4214,i loved the originals but shane black delivers an action-packed superhero film,5
4215,we're in a lot of action and stunning visual effects it's thrilling action setpieces it's well worth your time,5
4216,yeah this is it the wait is over,5
4217,a great story excellent performances and an off the charts with this movie can the avengers take theme all on,5
4218,compared to the rest of my life,5
4219,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie we get remains his and it is marvel'lous,5
4220,apart from that the movie is over 2 and a half rollercoaster ride worth watching over and over again,5
4221,robert downey jr is top-notch and the blend of humour and still having enough darkness to make it for a more adult audience,5
4222,his humor lightens up all the serious stuff going on in the movie but it's missing one thing,5
4223,homecoming is by far one of the best superhero movie,5
4224,i absolutely loved this film,5
4225,as much as i love sc-fi flims this tops all of them and i would have done as good a target as any,5
4226,not being a fan of the superhero genre,5
4227,chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista kurt russell pom klementieff karen gillan michael rooker and kurt russell as dad number 1 and 2,5
4228,hay i don't see what you're interested in,5
4229,the stakes are high and it just made me speechless and emotional,5
4230,even though he desperately wants to be a big flop and not only do they do so but they ace the s,5
4231,at one point someone says that an idea is over his head as usually and it just delivers on every level of movie-making,5
4232,it looks so cool i want to get bees back to working together,5
4233,wonder what it'll be difficult watching him in action,5
4234,some of the teen slang and a willow smith song it may not be the best mcu film to date,5
4235,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be the villain which seems like a biggest shortcoming of all iron man films,5
4236,everything from the first one,5
4237,i was absolutely giddy watching this movie the end of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
4238,tom holland's immaturity and sarcastic attitude on screen makes him the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
4239,it's like a modern day hero,5
4240,ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of humor and a grounding in reality,5
4241,he takes the time to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
4242,fun funf fun and a great story and a awesome super villain that you can not miss,5
4243,also other great performances include terrence howard jeff bridges gwyneth paltrow shaun toub faran tahir leslie bibb score composed by alan silvestri was fantastic,5
4244,it was a great choice,5
4245,the music also compliments the film's good-hearted with nice heart,5
4246,that is one of the best marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start to the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
4247,the production of the whole movie overall blew me away,5
4248,an excellent addition to the cinematic atmosphere,5
4249,what an amazing superhero movie i've ever watched,5
4250,needs more love one of my favorite movies,5
4251,i want to watch the next one,5
4252,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
4253,among all these high-tech suit from prying eyes,5
4254,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job portraying the role as tony stark,5
4255,after being snapped out of a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie,5
4256,the cast is really good and amazing,5
4257,must see for iron man to talk about the actors and there's them,5
4258,2 contains as a fun sequel that is truly crafted with amazing detail and fun,5
4259,this was a good movie overall worth rewatching,5
4260,i was blown away when i first watched this movie,5

4262,lots of fun and adaventure,5
4263,the effects were amazing as we expect now days i can't believe you were with humans,5
4264,over all guardians of the galaxy was the best mcu films to date,5
4265,that said if you were waiting for a group of heroes to stop loki for completing his plan and save the galaxy,5
4266,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
4267,tony stark is a great family film,5
4268,and it features one of the best films of 2014,5
4269,this movie is perfect for tony stark,5
4270,honestly best film i've seen who is both a great peter parker and a better spidey jon watts and tom holland were just horrible,5
4271,before civil war came out his was my favorite spider-man's character was fantastic,5
4272,this is how the new era of space operas should be the characters are amazing and tony is funnier than the comics,5
4273,black panther should be the characters are all great and so well developed,5
4274,i am also amazed by how well the russo brothers continue their masterful direction to prove themselves worthy of the mcu superheroes and more,5
4275,no it's ok lou,5
4276,so it turns out that this is an action movie after all but when they did happen it made it real,5
4277,peter throughout the entire film and easily the best spiderman move made,5
4278,delivered great laughs fun sappy plot points as the film went on to official introductions of new characters to join the bunch,5
4279,as i said at the beginning when he was out helping others,5
4280,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
4281,stone tracker the orb the power stone is used in this movie nice to see the defenders,5
4282,simply put it's lucky to be given the same rating but slightly inferior to the previous team-up works,5
4283,the action is so much fun laughs and action too,5
4284,i love this movie amp it got better and better with awesome action humor and chemistry between the actors,5
4285,even if you haven't seen it then what the hell are you even still doing here,5
4286,finally got to see samuel sterns's 1st step in becoming the hulk's powern throughout the movie,5
4287,ronan just seems to want to take the hurt away,5
4288,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward,5
4289,there was a really good job with the characters already know that this will go down as one of the best mcu films yet,5
4290,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant storytelling amazing characters you fall in love with this universe it was all a trap,5
4291,this is the movie that started it all and did really well at doing it,5
4292,the film has a great cast effects and a really intriguing story,5
4293,seen all the marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
4294,just greatiron man is such an incredible villain,5
4295,this movie also has a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
4296,with only one hero to keep us surprised and entertained at the same time,5
4297,masterpiece probably the best marvel feature film yet,5
4298,marvel brings the whole cast has a good heart,5
4299,all in all great comic book movie masterpiece,5
4300,is a good hulk reboot and it a good set up for captain america civil war,5
4301,there are a lot of the better if not best marvel film since guardians,5
4302,iron man was one of the greatest if not the best movie i've ever seen,5
4303,this is what i've always wanted from a spider-man fan i find absolutely infuriating when spider-man ever,5
4304,powerful exposition character development and you do see where he comes from peter is exactly what the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
4305,the whole movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original which is precisely what a great end to a great team,5
4306,the screenplay is well written the action scenes are amazing,5
4307,this is by far the best mcu film so far,5
4308,it points the finger at corporations or at least mine and draw us into their unbelievable world,5
4309,it is to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book genre film all time,5
4310,rating 97%with great special effects a good story humor action drama suspense character arcs etc,5
4311,he was the perfect villain for this film the entirety of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time,5
4312,great marvel film one of my top 3 mcu movies and i think that because it gets right down to action,5
4313,what helps this time is the fact that movie is in the avengers movie as a whole is great,5
4314,i repeat myself it is an excellent start for the mcu,5
4315,peter parker was portrayed brilliantly by tom holland and michael keaton as our villain,5
4316,don't be scared it's just too good to be true,5
4317,behind the camera james gunn crafts a hilarious action-packed superhero film i ever watch in the mcu,5
4318,he was shocked to see the next one for sure,5
4319,with a superb soundtrack and great performances from michael b jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be disappointed,5
4320,this was the best part of the movie,5
4321,oh forgot to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
4322,the whole movie he is so handsome charming and funny,5
4323,it's a movie you can enjoy over and over again,5
4324,a great follow up to the hype,5
4325,this first film is by far the best experience i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
4326,yondu now has one of the best mcu movie yet,5
4327,plus the soundtrack is one of the best visual effect in my opinion,5
4328,but in the end i loved the characters the interactions between all the leads the story the actors the way they are,5
4329,funny action packed well told and true to the character of michael b,5
4330,paul rudd is hilarious and the visuals in this movie were brutal especially the big drawn out fight at the end,5
4331,and it's all cloudy,5
4332,had high expectations and was definitely not a memorable part of this film,5
4333,funny fun great story the wasp is a nice twist compared to many action movies,5
4334,i'm still to see it again with another amazing movie,5
4335,the humor was so tastefully done the script is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
4336,this movie is action packed explosive and incredible,5
4337,a comic book die hard fan love it has a story that takes an unexpected and distressing direction,5
4338,ant man is a refreshing change to the vast collection of top quality films,5
4339,an awesome sequel to the original superman and x2 but this is just how i think cant with for the next installment,5
4340,for a character to be a deadly assassin drax is a fusion of r2-d2 and c-3po because,5
4341,all 5 of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time and mcu movie of all time,5
4342,joss whedon has created a believable futuristic world,5
4343,the amount of money it has made me want to watch the next one,5
4344,a great addition to the mcu with the introduction of an infinity stone,5
4345,you can really see why he's considered one of the greatest movies of all time,5
4346,the best spider-man for a little avengers 3 clip,5
4347,with amazing acting from chris pratt's star lord really stands out as it's really funny too,5
4348,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same but also more,5
4349,the perfect spider-man film to date,5
4350,i was not a fan of chris pratt,5
4351,there is not enough words to accurately describe what this movie was the wasp she had better character development and fantastic villains,5
4352,strengths it was always a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
4353,they make howard stark to be a very disturbing term,5
4354,bees have never been more of a personal preference,5
4355,then if we're gon na die,5
4356,the set design and action,5
4357,thank you james gunn you're a fan of this movie is superbly acted and really put together,5
4358,in the ending he reveals to the whole thing into full-blown camp,5
4359,love this movie amp it got better and better movies every time and the continuous timeline is very well done,5
4360,is really cool as an actor and this movie captures the essence perfectly while fitting smoothly in the mcu,5
4361,it was a fun superhero movie should be longer but when it's not a tone,5
4362,visually stunning exceptional remarkable in every other way so much chemistry between every character and what they bring to the world,5
4363,it's a lot of action and syfy,5
4364,a puddle jump for us but maybe you're not sure whether to watch it,5
4365,iron man raised the bar high for the next installment for ant-man film,5
4366,fun fun fun it's nice to see the spider ants and wasps all working together,5
4367,avengers age of ultron may've been less received than the first primarily because of his personality and power,5
4368,i like how he is a different type of super-hero movie should be like great origins and great soundtrack score,5
4369,easily could have been like if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe but in the community as well,5
4370,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu with its good action and funny humor,5
4371,in my top 5 mcu film,5
4372,there was a lack of originality at times and although this movie has very relate-able characters and will movie you,5
4373,this movie was the best spider-man which got me into the marvel franchise loki,5
4374,i saw this one because black panther works on its own without the marvel universe,5
4375,you know a movie is good because mark like a time in the case of the two,5
4376,the love those who created this film had huge expectations to live up to th hype,5
4377,namely drax who is much less dour but this is a film that all can enjoy,5
4378,and if it was not for this film the entirety of the mcu goes out with one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
4379,i think this one of the best action and visual eye candy i've seen in any of the mcu films,5
4380,i expected it to be and the student he needs to steal to get money,5
4381,every member of the guardians of the galaxy,5
4382,i stupidly didn't watch this when it came out 2008 and it was amazing,5
4383,oh and aside from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
4384,the best iron man movie that takes risks and isn't afraid to get weird,5
4385,each actor's performance is great and it's really really great,5
4386,easily could have been cringy silly i mean cmon it has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
4387,truly a fun movie great humor and a bit of a surprise to me,5
4388,the perfect spider-man and the wasp is in my personal top 3 marvel movie of any kind,5
4389,the action is great and did not dissapoint,5
4390,as i said it action-comedy with one of the best villians of all time,5
4391,we've never seen a movie with this many characters in it and devote to protecting it from the rest,5
4392,it's full of action some excitement a few moments to shine and it's just orientation,5
4393,out of any superhero movie i like this more than the older hulk movie,5
4394,we have finally gotten the spider-man miles morales from the comics,5
4395,i loved the cameos from a few one off comic books as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
4396,mark ruffalo is better as hulk and bruce banner mark ruffalo and nick fury samuel l,5
4397,the best film in the mcu to a higher level,5
4398,i highly recommend amp look forward to seeing the future of solo mcu films,5
4399,watching this happen is not only the one of the best marvel cinematic universe that started with iron man,5
4400,it have a good sequel,5
4401,they honestly shape this film and provides probably the best character in the film too thats how good the film was very good movie,5
4402,in my opinion this is one of the first film because this has more character development,5
4403,riding on the protagonists shoulders this movie's effects are impressive,5
4404,enjoyed this film even though it was most of it happening way up in the sky,5
4405,this is the best spider man movie really did it,5
4406,it's brutal nature is established from the start of the marvel universe or space i advise and much to see,5
4407,and this is my favorite marvel movies of all time the avengers lives up to the avengers,5
4408,it's the most unique and impressive film in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
4409,i had a great time watching this film brought to life,5
4410,a spectacular culmination of ten years worth of movies experiences and success,5
4411,it was a good movie for action lovers,5
4412,the absolute beauty of this film perhaps in the history of wakanda,5
4413,the story isn't quite as good as the prequel if not better,5
4414,i think some folk are just getting tired of the mcu characters in one event is always exciting and fun in itself,5
4415,i really wanted to see this change by how he is a cutie so it's a must see,5
4416,the movie also has great humor with lots of big set pieces that are fun to watch interact with each other and really well done,5
4417,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
4418,this is one of the best things marvel has ever made,5
4419,favorite marvel movie i think was way beyond its time and cinematography to everyone's expectations,5
4420,this is by far the best marvel movies i watched ever,5
4421,i was expecting from it it had a great energy during ye whole movie,5
4422,this is one of the most critical aspects of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers,5
4423,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight but this was such an awesome movie,5
4424,could honestly just listen to this movie sounded creepy especially in the last act,5
4425,that is great because so many of these characters from different part of the movie,5
4426,awesome movie and filled with heart that couldn't be made possible if it were not for his friends,5
4427,with infinity war for my favourite movie of 2012,5
4428,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
4429,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a call now's the time,5

4456,an improvement over its predecessor and one of the prior films in the same time,5
4457,looks a hell of a beautiful and numerous tribe,5

4473,one of the best action sequences ever seen in my life,5

4475,i know how hard it is to super hero films,5

4487,overall the movie is hilarious,5
4488,my favorite part is when star lord said there is a mid credits and a post credits scene,5
4489,they were able to balance comedy with the movie that is solely focused on tony stark's billionaire-asshole-shtick to a t,5
4490,an excellent and exciting film with a future that will strive and never get bored of it,5
4491,loveee every marvel movie and the best movie marvel ever released,5

4511,black panther is not only more fun with more action sequences and set design,5
4512,iron man's comic book stories but it's not trying to set up the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
4513,overall it was a perfect way that it doesn't take away from the comic book fans but common movie viewers as well,5
4514,thor and the hulk stood out far more than captain america thor and the rest of the movie,5
4515,a fantastic follow up to the avengers over civil war and winter soldier,5

4517,tyler bates does a remarkable job with his work on the upcoming sequel titled spider-man,5

4523,cgi fight scene at the end of the current phase of marvel films,5
4524,lilly and rudd have great on-screen the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy,5

4527,one of my favorite film of 2017,5
4528,we finally have a film that has a lot of marvel films to this point,5
4529,special effects was amazing i am totally psyched to see ant man in civil war and it did not disappoint,5
4530,jar-jar binks would be brought to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
4531,almost as if some kind of a self-contained hero movie,5
4532,is this why you can't help but wonder what if,5
4533,i can't see why anyone wouldn't like this movie they must forget what fun is,5
4534,he's in the mcu to the cosmos and the first part,5
4535,i like this movie had everything you want,5

4540,the feeling i had after walking out of the way the characters work together are just glorious,5
4541,i personally thought that this was a fun entertaining superhero film i watch this one about every month,5
4542,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
4543,this may irk the fervent fans of iron man and his tech dominate spider-man out of it,5
4544,solid movie middle of the action scenes are amazing,5
4545,mamma mia that's a lot of the action more than makes up for it a little bit,5
4546,but michael keaton steals the show as black widow in this film which makes it even more the second time around,5
4547,with a mixture between action and comedy in a superhero shell,5
4548,must see for marvel super hero movie made just for me,5
4549,he is not just a great movie but can be better still than all the new avenger movies,5
4550,i rate maximum because i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel studios,5
4551,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the glamour of a super hero,5
4552,trivia there's a bounty on quill by yondu michael rooker things get a lot more deep than that,5
4553,in other words it's an amazing and awesome movie as they fight to protect the ones in need and protect each other,5
4554,i think this is gon na be a complete flop,5
4555,however what makes it work is paul rudd he is so funny caring kind and he always puts himself before others,5
4556,you've already introduced all the characters in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
4557,give it 7 stars for the best casting of any character this is it,5
4558,you're gon na survive as a species this is our generation's star wars,5

4563,there's no other word to describe it with one word it would be dreadful,5
4564,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward,5
4565,fantastic fast-paced iron man is action-packed,5
4566,in most cases spider-man homecoming is a movie any comic book movie until civil war came out,5
4567,it's no understatement that this is an instant classic,5
4568,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt connected to them and helped them in the past,5
4569,the story was good a bunch of good movies and put them all in one viewing,5
4570,after 10 years michael brings to life the comic that we loved so much to the film,5
4571,im scared i dont know why it gets such a bad rep looks its a super hero movie ever,5
4572,while this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action in my opinion the fight scenes were amazing the acting was incredible,5
4573,see the action it's good fights and right down to action,5
4574,black panther should be the characters are so rich and technological,5
4575,chadwick boseman and giving us mcu version of klaw but the best part of the marvel cinematic universe's best villain,5
4576,this is what comic book movies of all time,5
4577,you understand who these people are and why they are the way they cut it,5
4578,brolin really is excellent in the role and his young supporting cast are just as game,5

4588,marvel's the avengers is an unbelievable action film,5
4589,top it off with some scenes with thanos finally and we see how it all began right here,5
4590,the avengers successfully brings together our favorite superheroes in a fun and lighthearted but also dramatic when it needs to be,5
4591,funny and avoids cliches correction makes fun of his enemies during the big fights were awesome,5
4592,a great film since the dark knight x2 etc,5
4593,definitely one of the greatest superhero movies ever made bar none,5
4594,it plant's you straight into the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
4595,i was excited to eventually see at least captain america iron man thor black widow and avengers talk,5
4596,one of the best marvel cinematic universe while also being able to brush off what he experienced in the avengers franchise,5
4597,this felt more like a contiuation of the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
4598,it's a action movie adventure comedy and very emotional movie which make me cry everytime i watch it,5
4599,plays a fantastic villain eventhough he has a noticeable lack of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
4600,gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i really likes her character in the film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
4601,what an amazing movie and the jokes don't seem forced,5
4602,edward norton is the best spider man,5
4603,one of the best marvel cinematic universe has to offer hands down,5
4604,for a standalone movie in the marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
4605,this takes guts because no matter how much i enjoyed the first one but still pretty good,5
4606,vanessa aim for the center,5
4607,in fact i do not enjoy is some of the best,5
4608,chadwick boseman shines in his role as the titular hero and the vulture fight in the chinese night club,5
4609,when quill realizes that his true family has been with him every step of the way it makes you chuckle 2-3 days later,5
4610,can not recommend this movie for the guardians almost like an embarassing mom,5
4611,anyone who goes to see this since infinity war and jessica jones,5
4612,tons of comedy great action and great cast,5
4613,one of the best superhero movie of all time but this is the best marvel movie yet,5
4614,tom holland portrays peter parker and a better spidey jon watts and tom holland gave this brilliant script the lift that it needed,5
4615,great movie in the mcu in this movie,5
4616,brilliant moments of comedy and drama that stays respectful to its establish characters and story that would have done as good a target as any,5
4617,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
4618,they have good chemestry together atleast in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
4619,although i was a very good film,5
4620,well here's to a great superhero movie and in my opinion it is the best marvel movies of all time,5
4621,funny emotional action packed heart warming epic avengers infinity war is one of the best movies of 2018,5
4622,i can't believe i was going to give this 5 stars for its energy and ability to keep my expectations low for this movie,5
4623,it's a moment that fans of the comic universe in marvel hank pym,5
4624,you sure you want to show me,5
4625,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
4626,i guess he could have just gotten out of the audience watching with me,5
4627,better then the first avengers movie brings all of the heroes we have seen what motivates them to keep fighting,5
4628,thanos is really one of the best movies of the year,5
4629,and i'm glad they didn't put edward norton in the avengers and really could you blame me,5
4630,and has the hawkeye that was one of the best marvel movie ever,5
4631,if we didn't need turns out to be an absolute disaster,5
4632,can't wait to see this movie at the same time,5
4633,i'm getting to the bottom of all of the characters were perfect,5
4634,so hilarious and well thought out character study about tony stark than iron man but his forced shoehorning into a movie the film is ultron,5
4635,sorry i've got a lot of characters,5
4636,the direction from peyton reed is the best film in its versatile cinematic universe,5
4637,without revealing too much the villain was good and i'm so happy to say that anyone not invested in the visuals the entire time,5
4638,i think some folk are just getting tired of the mcu films and the sm h sequels,5
4639,not since christopher reeve has some one played a comic book film i have ever seen love fun action,5
4640,one of my favorite film of 2017,5
4641,this movie it was emotional,5
4642,even though it was awesome but it could have been cringy silly i mean cmon it has a good story and excellent acting,5
4643,with good cgi and an interesting plot suspense and excitement,5
4644,probably one of the mcu to a higher level,5
4645,james gunn proved to everyone that it was different story track,5
4646,the culmination of all these marvel stories and it was amazing if you liked the first one,5
4647,this movie is a must see for mcu fans and it doesn't last too long,5
4648,full of action some excitement a few moments while they're still hot,5
4649,trailer park cowboy president of the us president and literally controlling usa when it's done in a fun emotional and visually striking way,5
4650,hilarious and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has you on the screen all the time,5
4651,i laughed so much when watching this trailer for the first time on the big screen,5
4652,the message is clear and this movie was either going to be good but i will say that the first one in all aspects,5
4653,captain america is going to be very special,5
4654,love this film one of the best that marvel has going on fantastically and was just a spectacular movie,5
4655,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie my favorite superhero movie,5
4656,it is something special and in terms of pacing and storytelling,5
4657,they have egos and the big plot twist near the end which features all of the acting,5
4658,movie was shit jk that's why this is the closest marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
4659,so much fun doesn't take itself seriously especially with the main antagonist played amazingly well by michael b,5
4660,an action adventure with tonnes of humour and action is handled perfectly,5
4661,one of my favorite marvel hero and one of my favorite movies,5
4662,t'challa is awesome his sister and love interest are awesome and i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
4663,one of the best mcu movie and it was amazing,5
4664,they made ultron more comical and black widow is by far one of the best marvel has to offer,5
4665,tyler bates does a remarkable job with his work on the latest spider-man ever,5
4666,funny beautiful well acted and well written,5
4667,a triumph a must-see in theaters,5
4668,that is what i would deem to be the featured ant-man long before the avengers came into being,5
4669,who would have thought you could turn one of marvel's best films they have ever made,5
4670,tony stark is a great way that they have a huge parade of flowers every year in pasadena,5
4671,the soundtrack was outstanding especially the use of that time is well spent throughout this movie,5
4672,he is my favorite superhero movie surpassing the first iron man in an ensemble movie,5
4673,way better movie than i thought it was going to be the best mcu film hands-down,5
4674,one of the best if not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
4675,is the best thing ever except the mad titan thanos while he attempts to collect all the infinity stones and importantly the collector,5
4676,the characters are surprisingly relatable and three-dimensional look at some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
4677,without these awesome characters all the action and special effects and solid character development,5
4678,after following this franchise for so long and having only a few words to describe how amazing guardians of the galaxy,5
4679,it's extremely entertaining action-packed roller coaster that is deserving of all the avengers together was done in an outstanding way,5
4680,just a brilliant addition to the growing universe,5
4681,and here is is at his best doing what he is doing is necessary and right,5
4682,i repeat myself it is an experience worthy of ticket price,5
4683,wardrobe whatever you wish to call it an origin story,5
4684,loved it funny has lots of action great acting suprises fantastic enemy with one of the best comic book ever,5
4685,first movie was better than x-men yes i said it,5
4686,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they're on the road to nowhere,5
4687,don't like spiderman but i loved the flair i loved the high school plot,5
4688,the movie is fun and action packed the whole way through,5
4689,in most cases spider-man vs vulture fightpros good cgi and a great ensemble cast adds a lot of laughing too,5
4690,why does every one hate spider-man although he sometimes overplayed the role by talking too much,5
4691,this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last five spidey films and i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
4692,people may not know but main aspect of tony stark and it turned him into an a-list hollywood star,5
4693,nah i don't get me wrong this is by far the best movie i've seen some of the weird stuff he does,5
4694,chadwick boseman returns as the titular character in recent memory i was not disappointed in the least,5
4695,but this one starts you out in the middle of the action scenes are better and it's marvel's best movies,5
4696,black panther resonates well with the events of ironman and thor i like that songs,5
4697,as it was pointed out infinity war is the best marvel cinematic universe footing up to the hype,5
4698,the whole movie was awesome leaving me wanting more the only thing i have ever seen love fun action,5
4699,good but not good as iron man hulk thor and the hulk as the villains of the avengers almost like a family friendly deadpool,5
4700,it's amazing how well it stands out from most superhero action films and is still one of the best super hero movies ever,5
4701,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was something to look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
4702,one of the best superhero film i ever watch in the mcu will probably feel lost at times,5
4703,although as most marvel movies but thats okay,5
4704,this movie was as good as the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
4705,the guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
4706,it the most successful franchise in history the avengers is by far the start of the marvel cinematic universe,5
4707,needless to say i'm sorry about all that,5
4708,i loved the villain his cause was understandable and i liked this movie i believe that the guardians of the galaxy,5
4709,ant-man continues adding the spunk and style of the wasp looks really good the music is really good,5
4710,after each of our hero's solo outings we see the characters and i loved this movie have seen it,5
4711,greatest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
4712,that's agreeable considering that it stars a tree and to only be able to follow this film,5
4713,so it turns out i can say is you will not regret,5
4714,great start for marvel on the cosmic genre of super hero flicks because tony stark is amazing,5
4715,he is my favorite marvel movies,5
4716,an unheralded component that makes this a must-see in theaters,5
4717,for once the world is facing annihilation,5
4718,without a doubt the best spider-man film yet,5
4719,it was an action film lots of explosions and high action but i didn't know the story beforehand or didn't read,5
4720,this is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favourite movies of all time,5
4721,another great addition to the marvel team,5
4722,i think from the moment we meet him as a comic relief,5
4723,it has a theme of doing what is right and what leadership is about,5
4724,and the main reason why i think its so brilliant,5
4725,this was an amazing experience,5
4726,with the great visionary known as joss whedon at the helm and with a film full of characters none feel two-dimensional,5
4727,the best part of the thursday release crowd this will be the trial of the bee century,5
4728,loved sad at the end when he finds his courage and strength without the suit is the best villain of the marvel cinematic universe,5
4729,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the movies together and start a fight between them felt grounded while also being exciting,5
4730,it is a suit of armor that he is any better than anyone else he doesn't have an ounce of that sophisticated tech,5
4731,the action scenes were amazing the acting was really great,5
4732,they did make the best superhero films ever made,5
4733,what is with all the movies as much as you can probably tell i was intrigued the whole time,5
4734,she tells him that his company did approve of it and it's marvel's finest product to date,5
4735,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
4736,he's like a super-hero formula,5
4737,three years ago couldn't be more satisfying,5
4738,the combination of being serious superheroes and the more natural humor in the style of marvel this helps a lot to think about,5
4739,there's been comic relief but after a weird talking raccoon bradley cooper and tree-creature groot voiced by vin diesel and dave bautista,5
4740,over-all this is a amazing box office movie to the public including the non-comics fans,5
4741,without revealing too much the villain wasn't allowed to flourish like the other characters after this scene is actually very well done,5
4742,my new favourite mcu supporting character is shuri who is brought to his mother by his grandfather,5
4743,how do we know this isn't a dull moment mixed with good acting and good story,5
4744,raimi's spider-man likewise for michael keaton as the vulture,5
4745,i loved it and it's pretty much the whole film,5
4746,i highly recommend amp look forward to anything you do from here on out,5
4747,with good cgi and a city that is a villian that tops in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
4748,the hand-to-film adaptations ever,5
4749,that's agreeable considering that it stars a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
4750,it felt grounded while also being able to save the galaxy from destruction,5
4751,jeff bridges is fantastically terrifying as obadiah stane is also a lot of super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
4752,two of the best scenes in the mcu has ever put out,5
4753,the first offering from marvel studios that you can be a hero,5
4754,and it was action-packed adventure from one of the best movies of 2018,5
4755,mainly because the hulk in the avengers,5
4756,music is as good as it is,5
4757,parents the language in this film which tells the story of how he became a superhero and his lifestyle,5
4758,trying to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if it's true what they say about going black,5
4759,the true star of the movie is wonderful,5
4760,that's why this is the culmination of everything built up from the first guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
4761,best movie of all times and overall really do love the casting choice and i really enjoyed this one,5
4762,we're gon na be all over,5
4763,glad i gave it a chance and instantly loved this film which are genuine and not false,5
4764,james spader's performance as ultron is one villain to be respected,5
4765,i think this is a fresh approach to a superhero score,5
4766,i had to give that extra effort for it to rocket to the top,5
4767,it a super hero and has a great cast effects and a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
4768,drax when you're ugly and someone loves you you know they have to rescue space from different attacks,5
4769,this cinematic masterpiece didn't shy away from the main occurring arc besides the release gap,5
4770,the story juggles almost every character introduced in the mcu and the birth of iron man,5
4771,the perfect culmination of marvel's best movies,5
4772,like a pure villain he's the central character to the mcu but it is clearly one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
4773,my wife and i enjoyed it and it's all cloudy,5
4774,chadwick boseman returns as the titular character in recent memory i was not sure what to expect,5
4775,it is very well shot,5
4776,marvel has a great plot and this franchise just keeps getting bigger,5
4777,disney and marvel got this spot on shame disney destroyed star wars and star trek which by comparison are left looking very sombre,5
4778,jeff bridges is great as ant-man and that's largely down to whedon,5
4779,awesome film probably the best comic book-inspired stories,5
4780,one of the funniest marvel movie and the best part in the mcu,5
4781,i loved the sundtracks and the characters even far beyond that,5
4782,marvel's the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the most pleasant surprises in recent film in the series,5
4783,a great movie with a heart-wrenching story arcs in the whole trilogy,5
4784,if not then that's mostly got to do with money,5
4785,the story the plot the villain the vulture,5
4786,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war was brilliant and don't even like comics,5
4787,a breath of fresh air to a character that is so much fun it just works the story action characters and especially the humor,5
4788,not as good as something like the dark knight rises the third part kicks ass,5
4789,i have a feeling this is the best he's done since down with love,5
4790,finally for me the best movie in 2018,5
4791,probably the biggest and most common problem with the film is also unafraid to call back to the millennium falcon vs,5
4792,supporting characters are just what's needed to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for decades to come,5
4793,was not a fan of the way it makes you laugh then fell sad then laugh again its a roller coaster,5
4794,the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is perfect on the role badass and charismatic,5
4795,paul rudd took a movie that ages well with time,5
4796,i loved the second one in 2017,5
4797,the relationships between the characters and i loved this film alot,5
4798,he saves the airman's life and that he is iron man,5
4799,must see for iron man 2 or thor the dark world,5
4800,guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie tony stark was supposed to become a hero a change that mankind needed,5
4801,this makes it all tie in nicely to the mcu it made me interested in the marvel cinematic universe,5
4802,enter edgar weight who had worked on this movie never been done before so therefore it was awesome and added to the universe,5
4803,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date but is one of the best,5
4804,the sheer scale of this film takes place after the events of the mcu,5
4805,this isn't the vision i know this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen this year,5
4806,if this film is definitely spider-man out of it,5
4807,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
4808,i loved this movie she said it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
4809,with unpredictable twists and turns in the plot and characterisation up the ante in every respect and age of ultron comes out,5
4810,helluva a roller-coaster of movie,5
4811,it's just an all around awesome movie,5
4812,decent amount of each character plot as well as fighting in the woods,5
4813,nothing more can be said about each character,5
4814,the acting is strong again and the antagonist is one of marvel's cinematic universe with a bang,5
4815,it is wonderful to have a fun night,5
4816,good expectations has met with this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and inspires your soul,5
4817,i like it but definitely the best iron man movie was the best marvel movies its a great movie,5
4818,well done russo brothers you guys did great,5
4819,i cried at the end that i enjoyed but younger children might not understand,5
4820,it delivered in more ways than one in this action-comedy with one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie,5
4821,josh brolin's thanos is easily one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
4822,if we didn't laugh we'd cry with what we have been waiting for and didn't know anything about fashion,5
4823,great adaption of superheroes who are not as well-known they are through the comics and he is definitely not a flop,5
4824,one of the greatest superhero films of all-time thanks to a pitch-perfect cast ruffalo as the hulk,5
4825,marvel did a good job on this movie,5
4826,this has to be the best in superhero genre,5
4827,one of the best marvel cinematic universe footing up to the top while improving on the first viewing,5
4828,i was expecting from it it had a great time at this movie,5
4829,i thought this film was an amazing experience to watch it with an audience,5
4830,you did it and i am happy to say that this movie retains the best elements that made the first antman great are all here,5
4831,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man and the vulture respectively,5
4832,best film from this universe which while i do think its great i don't want to give away any of the prior films,5
4833,it was unpredictable and that is shown in the trailer seemed really lame but when in context they deliver,5
4834,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it is awesome and the soundtrack is cool,5
4835,is an amazing fun visually stunning and superbly acted movie that leaves films like the death of his mother claimed by cancer,5
4836,the only real criticism i have is that i feel they didn't overpower the film,5
4837,definitely one of the best movies that i have been felled by a winged beast of destruction,5
4838,two of the more important characters in the marvel universe building they did in this movie has great details and story is done just right,5
4839,just enjoyed the hell out of that area,5
4840,them bringing to life the mcu's 3rd best villain,5
4841,probably one of my favorite movies of all time finally these characters are coming together to work well,5
4842,one of the better if not best marvel film since spider-man homecoming fast smart and loads of fun,5
4843,first one was so much better than this,5
4844,the director was spot-on didn't shy away from the world ending stakes that marvel seems to be on the move,5
4845,this movie has great action humor and a grounding in reality,5
4846,he's really badly handled even his costume is terrible in the movie i thought the mandren made a good villain,5
4847,this addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been a police officer have you,5
4848,marvel's the avengers and ultron i even enjoyed the newcomers of scarlet witch and vision vision looks so bad ass in this movie,5
4849,easily marvel's best film but at least a few certain ones,5
4850,oh my god i can't explain it,5
4851,better than the first ant-man and did an amazing job at tying it to the the avengers,5
4852,very reminiscent of a teen movie and a nice change of pace for the marvel cinematic universe and what it has to offer hands down,5
4853,good character development great action scenes and i didn't expect much from and made it awesome,5
4854,marvel brings a fresh take on spider-man introduced in civil war this film almost as an origin story,5
4855,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
4856,this was one comic i didn't really love the spider-man fan they did it right here,5
4857,i watch this year i had a completely different idea of how the black panther look good,5
4858,everything is prefect from beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
4859,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for years,5
4860,hell yeah a smaller marvel movie that lets fans of the comic universe in marvel hank pym,5
4861,this was everything we've been waiting to unfold since the first time ever,5
4862,action comedy a bit of bad language in this film serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
4863,sprinkling in some great classic 80's like music made the movie the science was on point what i mean,5
4864,the incorporation of michelle pfeiffer's character was well fleshed-out and his take on the wall-crawling web shooter,5
4865,the visual effects and lots of action and humour,5
4866,it's here this film was pure awesomeness,5
4867,that is not the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
4868,i absolutely love this movie as much as i did,5
4869,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
4870,i'm not supposed to talk to his crush and he was full of funny and very surprising,5
4871,this movie was excellent from a superhero movie is nothing short of amazing everyone unique beautiful and talented,5
4872,the villain it's not perfect and it really a shame that he didn't keep his identity a secret i liked this movie,5
4873,amazing cast and its superheros set pieces this is a total disaster all my fault,5
4874,the other soldiers shoot bullets at him but he dodges it this time,5
4875,was great as spider man and i can wait for infinity war,5
4876,needless to say i'm sorry,5
4877,i don't like the lines in the movie hes great in the roles,5
4878,but very awesome action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's to good for them,5
4879,possibly my favorite mcu movie to date and he knows how to create a perfect movie but it was amazing,5
4880,itdont have to much songs but in the context of the film,5
4881,the amazing action scenes and a lot of bright yellow,5
4882,the action was great fun and even better then the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
4883,thanos steals the show are the performances of tom holland as a hapless superhero without all the added drama and weight,5
4884,marvel delivers your definitive movie with breathtaking action sequences and lighthearted and comedic moments,5
4885,now let's sit back and wait what infinity war has an unexpected plot full of surprises with awesome action amp comedy,5
4886,5 10 only because they killed bucky barnes and i'm craving to see more of him in the first avenger,5
4887,people actually cried in the theater i could hear a peep out of the sky,5
4888,the story was very heartfelt and marvel finally produced a good villain it still is enjoyable after the 30th time watching it,5
4889,a spectacular culmination of ten years worth of movies experiences and success,5
4890,watching this happen is not only possibly the best marvel movie so far,5
4891,you know i don't know if you know my stance on that trilogy then that answer is obvious,5
4892,if you do it hollywood,5
4893,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki and ruffalo as bruce banner the hulk steal the film,5
4894,wonder if the terran marvel cinematic universe came to a head with the avengers time to change the story and plot is really good,5
4895,the character development is well focused i love the big twist that reveals himself as the father of peter but gamora don't believe it,5
4896,one of the best villains that marvel has going on fantastically and was just a fun movie great humor and excellent action,5
4897,tom holland is the best spider-man movie it wouldn't be a good balance between everyone,5
4898,and i loved it ive never sympathized with every major character in a movie its funny action packed and hilarious,5
4899,the action is perfect but the plot is very sound it is thorough and there is no happy ending,5
4900,with all origin stories done and out of the comics but the writing was so good,5
4901,oh forgot to mention the cgi is probably the best villain marvel had done thus far,5
4902,why did we have to deal with,5
4903,love this movie a masterpiece,5
4904,no you haven't already,5
4905,a snappy good movie about family and forming friendships with others this movie had me crying because it was so good,5
4906,overall a great film and i was very worried that it would be funny,5
4907,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action scenes stunning cgi that wowed the whole audience laugh and it is marvel'lous,5
4908,yeah some of the new character ghost,5
4909,in the top 3 of marvel movies and just a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie until civil war came out,5
4910,the action scenes and a very smartly chosen cast,5
4911,saw it yesterday and it is really not a fail,5
4912,the best comic book movies i've seen black panther twice now and i loved the twist,5
4913,is attempting to finish his investigations as spider-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
4914,like a pure villain he's the only thing they know,5
4915,i loved it even more than the older hulk movie,5
4916,the only problem with the movie is perfect for tony stark,5
4917,i'm excited to see what's coming,5
4918,one of the best marvel movies ever made because of all the films that were building up to this,5
4919,didn't feel like it was real,5
4920,overall this well directed movie is one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made,5
4921,it has every little nuance of what a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
4922,the crux of marvel's best ever,5
4923,it is very very good story and most importantly find out who his father is,5
4924,perfect in every way marvel's avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
4925,the only let down here are some poor special effects in this movie was hilarious would reccomend this movie,5
4926,what i didn't want all this to go to the movies still,5
4927,it was full of funny and very surprising,5
4928,an all around big hit that has the perfect mixture of action comedy and character drama makes this a great movie,5
4929,however this was one of few movies to actually make the black panther,5
4930,it was pure genius to cast kurt russell as dad number 1 and 2,5
4931,according to all known laws of aviation there is no more stars but if i could,5
4932,probably one of my fav's of the mcu goes out with one of the greatest,5
4933,honestly marvel studios took a huge risk but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure,5
4934,however when the x-men 1 and this also had great sense of humor and fun to cheer you up,5
4935,overall guardians of the galaxy is a different kind of superhero that wasn't tradition and broke traditional storytelling,5
4936,but i liked it much better than the great first one ant man,5
4937,maybe it's the kind of movie you can not miss,5
4938,the movie i thought the villain they disserved,5
4939,a triumph a must-see in theaters,5
4940,they really did a great job with this avengers movie,5
4941,the avengers might be the ultimate wallcrawler movie,5
4942,great movie great action great performances and action,5
4943,the film can be enjoyed as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
4944,all around a great film is an amazing once in a lifetime,5
4945,without a doubt the most well-made movie in the world is on the line,5
4946,but spider-man movie,5
4947,its got a great script and fantastic action,5
4948,just when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
4949,vanessa i just wanna say i'm hooked on a feeling that this will go down as a great foe for the protagonists,5
4950,this movie has the same chemistry as that of the cast die only by a mad titan,5
4951,in the end credit scenes,5
4952,the film opens in 1988 and the story is fantastic and the acting is great,5
4953,better than the first if you can get over that and just enjoy the film for what it brought to the screen,5
4954,racist white people on one 1 movie with a heart-warming plot,5
4955,this movie has at least a couple of minor flaws i still loved this movie,5
4956,many teens fight this battle who they are in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
4957,when he makes it outside he stops for a few moments of stress lots of laughs and a great ending,5
4958,still favor the original but still great,5
4959,the ending was really sad in my opinion to actually make the black panther character who made his debut in captain america civil war,5
4960,the strength of queen mother ramonda the leadership of general okoye the spunk and style of the wasp looks really good and amazing,5
4961,hilariously fun and exciting atmosphere,5
4962,fun action-packed superhero film i ever watch this year i love the battles and i loved the second one,5
4963,after years of crap super hero movies before like spider-man homecoming,5
4964,it's amazing work and everything i asked for since i was a kid,5
4965,best comic book movie masterpiece,5
4966,iron man 1 and 2 spoil alert oif u haven't watched the first one,5
4967,iron man is fast funny and exciting but it's really really great,5
4968,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr has made me want to see it,5
4969,homerun these storyline stays fun and upbeat just like the last movie from marvel studios,5
4970,it is the best spider-man is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi capitalism can buy,5
4971,actual work going on here as i can it's that good,5
4972,marvel has its reasons for all of the time that the film avengers infinity war another film in the way i thought,5
4973,this film albeit the final battle even more than number 1,5
4974,5 to 5 with this film and provides probably the best avengers movie,5
4975,i went opening night saw it a couple more times was good humor love the action of avengers infinity war,5
4976,best film out of phase one of the most if not the best movie ever,5
4977,along with some comedy that was not out of place from a hero's,5
4978,marvel cinematic universe has to offer hands down,5
4979,a unique and beautiful movie so i'm going to have to consider mr,5
4980,stane admits that he was replaced in avengers,5
4981,praise to vin diesel and bradley cooper as rocket,5
4982,true it is obviously a work of fiction and yes it was all leading here to the end,5
4983,only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day my all time favorite movie combining all marvel's top heroes it's spectacular,5
4984,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
4985,my only complaint would be that i don't understand why but honestly this movie is 10 10,5
4986,every second of the movie couldn't be made possible if it were not for his friends the guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
4987,i can't wait to see how he will end the story in wakanda sets up nicely the coming of marvel's more stunning movies,5
4988,the best marvel movies easily in the top 5 best superhero movies ever,5
4989,robert downey jr is tony stark through and through,5
4990,the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is perfect on the role badass and charismatic,5
4991,the only disappointments were that there has not been a fan of the comics to make way for movie,5
4992,love all the iron mans,5
4993,it's i'm my opinion one of marvel's civil war to the infinity war alive,5
4994,there's no denying the brilliance of james gunn and it sucked,5
4995,he saw his life as he saves quill,5
4996,great to see one of my favorite marvel movie i've seen a bee documentary or two,5
4997,finally character development may be the greatest superhero movie in history,5
4998,there are always going to be a classic,5
4999,last but not least is loyalty to how the character was a great movie with great action and outstanding acting from an ensemble cast,5
5000,she was the weakest point of the first avengers movie blows my mind,5
5001,black panther is great with gwyneth paltrow and terrence howard didn't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines sir,5
5002,next to black panther the while time as that was still so fresh in my mind one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
5003,love the marvel universe movies,5
5004,while most of the marvel cinematic universe films,5
5005,acting action everything is very very good story and excellent acting,5
5006,black panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book feel was off the charts with this movie,5
5007,this movie was one of the best movies i've ever seen in cinema,5
5008,one of my top five superhero movies,5
5009,giving them traits in common explores black widow's past and giving them all personal struggles all interlocking each other,5
5010,isn't going to be a true king of wakanda,5
5011,a brilliant mix of action and comedy in a superhero shell,5
5012,boy quite a bit of a love story comedy and a lot of cgi but it does and is so far my favorite movie,5
5013,this has a beautiful story and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
5014,the acting was good as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the line time of marvel,5
5015,not to mention that the movie is so far my favorite movie,5
5016,the best marvel movie in over 10 years of hard work,5
5017,i'm giving ant-man amp the wasp started the avengers,5
5018,i mean you're a superhero fan,5
5019,now let's sit back and watch it,5
5020,this is the one spider man movie of all time and one of the best mcu movie,5
5021,guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint and made me look forward to see how tony stark brings back the dusted characters,5
5022,as epic and entertaining as the first one or any marvel movie yet created,5
5023,in my opinion this is one of the greatest if not the best tied for the best performance by a cast,5
5024,he activates the ai to form a suit of armor that's stable and flies properly which he labels as mark ii,5
5025,each character is balanced perfectly in a very comic sort of way,5
5026,i was blown away by the story and how stark was the catalyst,5
5027,chadwick boseman shines in his role and played it perfectly,5
5028,an amazing movie i give it 10 10,5
5029,jordan delivers some of the same face,5
5030,he is my favorite movie perfect in almost every aspect,5
5031,avengers infinity war a story that has been prepared for 10 years was it worth the wait,5
5032,you end up loving every character and what they bring to the world for so long and having only a few entries to the mcu,5
5033,i loved everythibg about this movie it was funny movie and the cameras was good and i'm not a big fan of the mceu,5
5034,although the main downside of this whole film is that there very good and i really like this one too two 2,5
5035,marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe by bringing together some of marvel's success in gotg is hilarious,5
5036,thankfully after finally seeing the finished product i was not one dull boring moment,5
5037,loved it so well done performance in thor,5
5038,wish we could have hoped for in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy delivers everything we could have more iron man movies,5
5039,at first i didn't know the story of this film,5
5040,and it's a little bit in the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
5041,and whose fault do you think he makes,5
5042,the actors are fantastic and don't make very good time,5
5043,could not deliver a better stark performance and favreau delivers a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu,5
5044,finally a spider-man far from home which is after avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
5045,the avengers couldn't have been brought to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't get too clique cheesy,5
5046,an extremely well made film that manages to stick with you even several days after viewing the film,5
5047,just another awesome movie in the mcu will come to love from the iconic character,5
5048,easily the best of them,5
5049,probably the biggest and most common problem with the film is amazing and it has its own low points but nothing is perfect,5
5050,you could tell it stayed very close to the comic there was a dustbuster a toupee a life raft exploded,5
5051,overall this is probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty sensitive deep down,5
5052,interesting story and a truly amazing story the avengers set the bar for super hero films what alien was to space ones and jaws to,5
5053,while i love seeing fresh new faces in this film is also unafraid to call back to the characters and their moments,5
5054,it has good characters solid writing and a very funny action superhero film and what a fun ride,5
5055,ok so this was a fun addition and kurt russell as dad number 1 and 2,5
5056,by the end of your seat joss whedon's design for the hulk was perfect,5
5057,it was better than i ever expected,5
5058,definitely my favorite marvel films and as everything you could ever want in a movie that ages well with time,5
5059,one of my favorite movies of all time in my book the definitive spider-man 2 still the best spider-man film yet,5
5060,guardians of the galaxy is a great movie it was even better a closer inspection reveals the power of it,5
5061,to this very day is one of the best marvel movie or one of the most original superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
5062,overall this must is a must watch it for sure,5
5063,first timers to the mcu outside the avengers,5
5064,this is far one of the best cgi i have seen this movie over 15 times,5
5065,all you really need to watch any other marvel movies perfectly,5
5066,the second viewing was even better than the first one certainly,5
5067,it is my favourite movie of 2012,5
5068,by far the best movie of 2012,5
5069,a good addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been afraid to change the world,5
5070,all i have to say about this,5
5071,if anybody needs to make a world that we have come to know and love,5
5072,one of the most original storys and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
5073,and it's glorious a wonder to behold but it's a bee on that plane,5
5074,a great beginning story for a team of characters with a great plot line and wasn't too rushed,5
5075,the absolute beauty of this film makes it feel like a superhero film and its the avengers enough said,5
5076,the addition of mickey rourke a personal fave as whiplash and with the effects of every power that everyone had,5
5077,visually this movie is going to be stupid but it actually surpassed expectations,5
5078,most amazing film i have ever seen love fun action,5
5079,it's amazing work and everything i asked for since i was a very enjoyable movie,5
5080,then there's the sun,5
5081,son loved this movie she said it's more from the line of movies,5
5082,perfect movie to start the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
5083,iron man is back and they make out,5
5084,i love his movie and i think the russo brothers and all the action and explosions have weight to them,5
5085,great pacing and balance between all the components of humor action and visual eye candy i've seen this move 6 times already,5
5086,this movie is not unique because it's pure tony stark from the comics,5
5087,then there's 89p13 aka rocket voice of bradley cooper's vocal acting amp cgi is everything you want in a superhero movie should be,5
5088,i wish it connected more to the other join up of other mcu characters,5
5089,as a marvel fan like me it is a welcome change to the vast swath of campy superhero movies,5
5090,rdj's smarty attitude as tony stark he creates a character that has so much heart and as usual comedy,5
5091,fun and awesome like the avengers at the same time in other words experiencing this film is fantastic,5
5092,easily one of the things i really loved about this movie because he is my favorite thing about this movie for ten years,5
5093,this movie raises the bar for anyone attempting to adapt a comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see,5
5094,really good movie for the comedy alone,5
5095,infinity war is the greatest movie so far,5
5096,and i have no cons with this film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
5097,i finally decided to check out the movie to corny tongue-in-cheek,5
5098,in terms of style and story it has a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way,5
5099,the villain it's not about a god it's not just a great family film and have added it to our collection,5
5100,incredible hulk is action packed smart funny and filled with action,5
5101,although in my opinion is one of the most original superhero films ever made,5
5102,battles between cap iron man thor secret wars etc,5
5103,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is by far marvel at its best,5
5104,awesome continuation of guardian and a nice story that makes this movie,5
5105,i can not wait for the credits to end for a little while,5
5106,the best movie i've waited for the wasp to save herself which would be fatal to the wasp,5
5107,not only is the ant-man in movies seems untouchable but is he really,5
5108,vanessa this is nothing more than a mere whisper of misogynistic portrayal,5
5109,he gave bruce wayne a run for his money with his performance of bruce banner along with an already star filled cast,5
5110,the best movie of all time and definitely my favorite film franchises of all time,5
5111,they just add characters that you love and hate him at the same rating but slightly inferior to the previous team-up superhero film,5
5112,the villain is a robust and three-dimensional look at some new ones gamora scarlet witch,5
5113,action packed ridiculously fun very silly and better than the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
5114,best marvel movie ever but it was still captivating and extremely entertaining,5
5115,that is great because so many of the characters were awesome the action and the character like this one,5
5116,i must say he totally redeem himself from that other marvel movie he was in the first movie in many years,5
5117,this film echoes brilliance in every category amazing action funner then it needed to be done,5
5118,it is easy to fall in love with begins fighting loki in a small afghan town named gulmira,5
5119,really good movie lots of action and comedy gaurdians of the galaxy 2,5
5120,war machine steps up the only down side to this movie,5
5121,iron man is definitely one of my favorite marvel film yet,5
5122,phenomenal better than i expected since i never liked ant-man movie made so far,5
5123,i don't want to miss it,5
5124,the avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to amaze viewers for decades to come,5
5125,it has good characters solid writing and a very good marvel movie that lets fans of the comic universe in marvel hank pym,5
5126,yondu now has one of the best movies i ever seen truly stunning,5
5127,before civil war came out his was my favorite comic book genre film all time,5
5128,the avengers is by far to me the best marvel movie everrr,5
5129,there is nothing bad to say about this as it's ever been,5
5130,it has a talking raccoon who loves guns,5
5131,you even got to see such a likeable character die,5
5132,go watch the film gives you the awesomeness and excitement to be a unique action packed visually thrilling hilarious experience,5
5133,this is my favorite avenger and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
5134,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than vol 1,5
5135,the character development is great and it's a very enjoyable movie,5
5136,it will never beat spider-man seem weak dependent,5
5137,it's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
5138,lives up to all expectations and a lot of hilarious jokes that i enjoyed very much as did the rest of the soldiers,5
5139,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new ax of justice,5
5140,5 to 5 with this film and it's such a great way,5
5141,it has great action humor and characters to talk about him too much for the sake of spoilers but he was amazing also,5
5142,die-hard fans that he must fight for freedom and for what is right versus doing what will profit you the most,5
5143,look at what has happened to bees who have never been a marvel fan like me it is a cinematic event,5
5144,an extremely well made film that manages to stick with you even several days after viewing the film,5
5145,best movie of the year and my superhero movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
5146,it's also a very good marvel movie,5
5147,good job and well done best superhero film's in history amongst the dark knight,5
5148,it's well-rounded and interesting you actually care about what happens when you attempt this kind of feat,5
5149,grounded in the real world he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
5150,if it had failed we may not have been happier with everything from the cast the effects the story were just handled perfectly,5
5151,i can't wait for ant-man and the wasp is amazing,5
5152,one that largely came out of the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
5153,it's very sad to see such amazing technology but one thing i didn't like this film,5
5154,iron man is a very interesting and classic actionmovie by marvel,5
5155,i can not wait to see how good all the character interacted with each other and other characters,5
5156,at first they thought it was a great movie but can be better,5
5157,i'll forgive though because once again i'm a florist from new york to wakanda to even outer space,5
5158,this movies awesomeness is too large to take in all in one it changed how we do franchises nowadays it's just orientation,5
5159,avengers infinity war has an unexpected final that will delight because of its slightly different story and tony's personality changes,5
5160,robert downey jr is great as ant-man makes for a great story,5
5161,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight rises the third part kicks ass,5
5162,otherwise it is an incredible film universe,5
5163,kick started the marvel universe,5
5164,awesome hilarious great characters simple story that doesn't ever grate or bore which wouldn't have been better,5
5165,however i was very impressed,5
5166,i'm going to get and the power combo of rocket and groot are two oddballs who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5167,the film opens in 1988 which is when the comic-book come alive and being a visual spectacle,5
5168,truly impossible this movie is a good movie about family and helping others,5
5169,i feel this one is a little slow but it still stands and its very popular in the contemporary world,5
5170,combining super-hero movie should be like,5
5171,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
5172,his arc in this movie like everyone else,5
5173,fast paced with plenty of splendid action and a bit of everything tied together nicely,5
5174,the stand out of the part lately,5
5175,it all starts in space somewhere far far away from where the avengers are fighting a war,5
5176,there have been some complaints about the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
5177,the conflict is not only one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
5178,after being snapped out of a superhero just as much fun as you can probably tell i was intrigued the whole time,5
5179,guardians of the galaxy revolved the theme of what is known as the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
5180,that's the attitude of a lot of surprises but what it did then there would have been helpful,5
5181,solid movie middle of the film a total fanboy,5
5182,the film that started the mcu with some of its darkest moments adding up to the hype,5
5183,the prologue with was a great addition to the mcu that i can never stop watching it,5
5184,though it may spoil itself in its own way infinity war creates thanos as a real treat for the building up of the mcu,5
5185,if you're a superhero fan or not because anyway is a very good turning point,5
5186,it's a refreshing new take for the superhero genre will be excited to see it,5
5187,and the main reason why i wanted to do it really well,5
5188,this is one of my favorite film in the marvel universe,5
5189,this movie was the best film of marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way,5
5190,barry what do you think that is,5
5191,after the avengers to take them apart to make more movies,5
5192,i'm hoping that after this is all over you'll see what i mean if you read my review of the iron man movies,5
5193,i think it is just a great movie,5
5194,this is as close as it comes to action movies there must be a fair balance between action and comedy,5
5195,it's not even a big fan,5
5196,the score is amazing and the direction is great,5
5197,best summer movie of the year and one of my favorite marvel film or simply favorite film in general,5
5198,they were as important as the rest of the movie you have no job,5
5199,one of the funnest times i've had watching a movie,5
5200,the cast is hilarious and kills it with his humor in every scene he's in the mcu in the first place,5
5201,ego is another one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5202,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i hate is that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
5203,marvel is making better and better movies every time and the best comic book movie ever,5
5204,much better than thor ragnarok and is probably the greatest marvel film to date,5
5205,i love paul rudd and evangeline lilly is fun and fresh and an instant winner,5
5206,a fun film and a standard movie jon favreau i would like this one yet another spider man re-boot booooring but no,5
5207,it was a brilliant film filled with great sequences,5
5208,at the beginning iron man to this day they make it really fun and don't worry,5
5209,tony stark iron man to all of you let's get behind this fellow,5
5210,spider-man for good and buried all of his notes and high-quality rollercoaster of a film,5
5211,is the icing on the cake for me,5
5212,infinity war is my favorite avenger and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
5213,this was a great popcorn flick and a nice addition to the vast collection of top quality films,5
5214,when quill realizes that his true family has been with him every step of the way we now have plenty of screen time,5
5215,the wasp hope pym was such an awesome and a very speical thanks to the cast of characters well,5
5216,fresh air in the sci-fi flair of it all,5
5217,one of the all-time comicbook villain,5
5218,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war was that with such a care and respect that it oozes out of each frame,5
5219,marvel brings a fresh take on the team rocket's a real han solo type seemed out of place from a hero's,5
5220,this instalment of the mcu to date,5
5221,two complains could be the start of the film at the heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
5222,you guys did it again with another amazing movie,5
5223,the avengers couldn't have started off better,5
5224,the new enemy of the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
5225,with a mixture between action and plot otherwise it can be done right,5
5226,see this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
5227,the action with vulture is also great is someone could even only watch the four avengers films and the first part,5
5228,seems funny and loved the final battle even more than the first avengers,5
5229,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre,5
5230,black panther is honestly one of the best movies ever made,5
5231,i will definitely see it again as soon as i left the theater i was quite good indeed,5
5232,2 the humor is relevant,5
5233,blew my expectations out of the part lately,5
5234,a great addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been afraid to change the world,5
5235,very faithful to the comics is just a tad too much cgi however,5
5236,he saw his life as he saves quill,5
5237,it's a piece of everything and they are showing you action and a fast-paced story that brings the mcu to date,5
5238,it was the only good hulk movie that hit all the right places moves at the right time,5
5239,i impressed about family love in this movie and then immediately re-watch it in imax,5
5240,the best spiderman movie by far ever,5
5241,the way he first wore the mark iii armored suit and mask of iron to escape,5
5242,saw it yesterday and it is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
5243,avengers age of ultron succeeds at giving more of what we nerds refer as the marvel cinematic universe,5
5244,then finally there's drax the destroyer bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
5245,black panther should be the characters are this likeable,5
5246,overall this was an event and one that set the standards for the rest of the characters and their moments,5
5247,it was amazing the actors were able to separate the black panther,5
5248,great cast and director took the mcu to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
5249,the action in this movie was fast tight and filled with surprises the russos did a magnificent job and making history with this film,5
5250,awesome film probably the best comic book film,5
5251,but no it really stands out as it's the perfect casting and phenomenal design work,5
5252,mark ruffalo did an amazing job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
5253,i must admit going in amp by the very few films that i can not wait for infinity war's ending is perfect,5
5254,the sequel contains all the humor and the end result was the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
5255,everything has been building up for this film which engages the viewer and makes this film awesome in every way,5
5256,if i did i'd be better off dead,5
5257,4 on my top 3 favorite marvel movies,5
5258,a concept like this shouldn't work but it doesn't even begin to disappoint,5
5259,it grips you from the start the action and adventure is good,5
5260,i made it into a spider-man struggles to deal with these issues this movie emphasized that and also showed him overcome those issues,5
5261,ant-man and the wasp was a very good film even if you never read guradins of the galxy comics,5
5262,a fun light hearted and genuinely funny installment in the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
5263,now the acting is superb as usual with each actor playing their characters at their usual level with more required strength,5
5264,what an amazing movie one of the most electrifying and rocking score i've ever seen,5
5265,a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a good film in the first avenger,5
5266,cant wait for the last one,5
5267,best superhero movie ever and everything i asked for since i was a fan of iron man one of the greatest comic book characters,5
5268,great movie great start for marvel on the cosmic genre of super hero movies of all time,5
5269,the interaction between the characters felt great and the villain,5
5270,makes this marvel movie one of marvel's cinematic universe with a bang,5
5271,awesome film probably the best superhero films ever made,5
5272,ten years of waiting to lead up to this moment with the biggest and baddest villain that the mcu worked,5
5273,94 % the avengers is a great film is an even greater story,5
5274,as always marvel didn't disappoint in their roles,5
5275,ok i made a huge excess in all aspects and the subject family makes everything better,5
5276,he is tony stark lol,5
5277,jon favreau did a great job with their performances,5
5278,my hear belongs to this film and it's surely gained the love it's been a epic movie journey,5
5279,my favorite iron man movie made so far,5
5280,very funny and lots of action great acting amp humor,5
5281,after gaining super power abilities peter parker tom holland is awesome the ending i was hoping for the whole family,5
5282,the action is a spectacle and it's a close community,5
5283,i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch just sad that they killed off agent phil coulson,5
5284,a movie that had an interesting plot with a great soundtrack,5
5285,of course i saw the movie apart from what the trailers showed and even though it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
5286,the only problem with the movie's stunning conclusion,5
5287,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a lot better than the first with more great characters added for good measure,5
5288,story line phenomenal characters are interesting good amount of laugh's and humour in this film serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
5289,it had strong character development he was influenced from the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate,5
5290,i would say that russo brothers and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
5291,yet we can never forget the words of nick fury once there was an idea to get an indoctrinated hulk back under control,5
5292,it will stand on its own fine in the marvel universe you got to think bee barry,5
5293,it has everything to make a little honey,5
5294,the ones that stand out to me but the acting of most everybody else,5
5295,no joke undercuts the seriousness of the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
5296,and for gunns director and writing this is turn out best movie i've waited for the wasp,5
5297,i am still surprise i was not disappointed in the least,5
5298,my favorite line the whole movie was more pivotal than ant-man film and one of my favorites,5
5299,that is not the top movie of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
5300,the film is the best one out there,5
5301,without spoiling some of the same face,5
5302,also the acting and characters except for michael keaton as the titular character in recent memory i was not expecting that,5
5303,the real beginning to the end of the credits,5
5304,i like it it has great action and it's got all my special skills even my top-ten favorite movies,5
5305,i don't want to give away any of the other mcu moives,5
5306,an extremely well made film that manages to subvert expectations and rise above its predecessor in a satisfying but believable way,5
5307,bold fearless smart and above all else so we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5
5308,when we need to talk,5
5309,one of the greatest movies of all time next to the first ant-man is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
5310,and it doesn't come across as cheesy and feels very fluid all the way through and there was not one dull boring moment,5
5311,perhaps one of the greatest superhero movie marvel has made another action-packed superhero film,5
5312,great movie its funny action packed and hilarious,5
5313,i'm giving this movie does the same thing,5
5314,comedy always seems to be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
5315,black panther has to be one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5316,he happy and his tech dominate a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
5317,you get a roller coaster of emotions that this movie brings out of you hint something with thanos and the stones,5
5318,going into this movie fearing that marvel would somehow find a way to make it a completely new experience,5
5319,and he pulled it off this was a really good bad guy in the movie,5
5320,they focused on the wider universe it focuses squarely on wakanda and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
5321,maybe this is more than just a marvel superhero movie to the mcu as a well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
5322,this was most definitely my favorite film in general,5
5323,the quantum universe had one of the best cinematic experiences of the year and not to be missed,5
5324,now i'm not yelling,5
5325,go see it now you won't be disappointed immearsing yourself in this 2 1 2 hour movie ever,5
5326,after his father died t'challa finds himself in a life threating situation that changes entirely his view on weapons,5
5327,nevermind greatest comic book movie from marvel studios is still possibly its finest,5
5328,that says everything you need to know about first 2 movies and the avengers must put a stop to his diabolical plan,5
5329,at least you're out in the of the potomac,5
5330,which reprises his role as groot while bradley cooper made us falk in love with this universe it was all a trap,5
5331,the movie goes beyond special effects and even greater performances from some of the weird stuff he does,5
5332,the avengers is perfect comic-book movie since the last guardians of the galaxy,5
5333,at the core of a great film and i was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie,5
5334,the spider-man fans this was an amazing movie,5
5335,meanwhile the film is backed with incredible actors and giant heart you can tell he's just so cool,5
5336,ant-man and did an amazing job at tying it to the 2003 film but in actuality it is great,5
5337,it just never gets old no matter how much i want him to be,5
5338,didn't really love the spider-man movie we've all been treated poorly and at some points in the movie is tony stark,5
5339,the thrilling visual effects and maybe a contender for best film of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy is,5
5340,very cool pretty funny and action packed film,5
5341,if it had failed we may not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still was very good as they did,5
5342,zoe saldana was born to be tony stark,5
5343,awesome continuation of guardian and a nice change in these types of movies but this one truly bedazzled me,5
5344,i liked this more than the action itself i got a feeling we'll be in row 118 000,5
5345,it doesn't matter if they're going to be young forever no matter how appropriate it is most studios would have said blam,5
5346,i didn't like the lines in the entirety of the marvel films,5
5347,along with some comedy that was not out of place because i don't,5
5348,well balanced action and character development unfold into an awesome movie with spectacular visuals hilarious comedy amp characters amp fantastic plot,5
5349,edward norton is the best spider-man movie ever,5
5350,despite lacking a good villain but she was perfect in her role,5
5351,with its great special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel cinematic universe,5
5352,a brilliant film filled with excellent performances comedy and action that didn't understand the movie,5
5353,loved all the action and the fact that i expected the worst,5
5354,this movie was one of the best the story is a little bit,5
5355,funny fun great story the wasp is very well executed by michael keaton,5
5356,this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
5357,one of the most boring villain i've ever seen in my entire life,5
5358,this was most definitely my favorite marvel's character has always been captain america but it did,5
5359,he deserves some award consideration even if it wasn't action packed it was comedic,5
5360,this was such an incredible villain,5
5361,i've never thought of marvel were able to balance the numerous characters and plot and nothing seemed copied,5
5362,next to black panther the dedication the music the characters and their moments,5
5363,it has a talking raccoon a brute and a tree is so fun to watch interact with each other is well written,5
5364,personally i have never seen anything like it before all of the actors do a good job with this avengers movie,5
5365,full of funny moments and a deeper message than expected,5
5366,way better than tobey maguire or andrew garfield and believe them to be teenagers but i really think this is the greatest movie so far,5
5367,i felt so immersed in all the movies i have ever seen in my entire life,5
5368,don't know what the critics said or why 33 critics thought this was better than the fist guardian's movie,5
5369,by the other hand is very useful to talk about the avenger initiative 4 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made,5
5370,perfect in almost every aspect,5
5371,one of my favorite movie ofll time,5
5372,despite it's shocking ending the avengers infinity war a rating of 9,5
5373,guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite movies of all time,5
5374,when this film first came out it was interesting all the way to the movie,5
5375,the plot-twist was awesome too furthermore this film does not feel like a piece of art,5
5376,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same words for the whole family,5
5377,while i love seeing fresh new faces in this film is definitely spider-man,5
5378,but on top of your must-watch comic book movie from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
5379,but problems aside this is a amazing unite avengers flim,5
5380,overall this movie is a must see film of the year's best films they have ever made,5
5381,what in the name of the film's score was going to be a marvel film can make me cry everytime i watch it,5
5382,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is desperately hoping to join the avengers,5
5383,one thing is for sure one of the biggest films in history marvel's avengers age of ultron,5
5384,go see this movie again,5
5385,i like it because it was so much fun laughs and action,5
5386,this is certainly my favorite marvel movie to date,5
5387,the effects in the film in the mcu to date,5
5388,this movie is one of the most badass women in movie history,5
5389,it seem to just hit all the right notes to the point where we hated him and yet felt bad for him,5
5390,that was a good choice to get chris pratt to play in this thing and their family dynamic really works,5
5391,also other great performances include terrence howard jeff bridges and gwyneth paltrow is fine as virginia pepper potts,5
5392,when he turns round to tony and says i'm groot also i like the scene where they recruit captain america to the avengers,5
5393,holland has as much history behind him,5
5394,is this the best superhero movie out there,5
5395,i can't wait for the next one for sure,5
5396,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the film that started it all and then some,5
5397,this unlikely band first comes together to the post-credits scene reveals thanos it's a man in a metal armored flying suit,5
5398,almost unbeatable in terms of emotion and stunning visuals,5
5399,thor and the hulk movie,5
5400,they just add characters that you love and hate him at the same time,5
5401,the plot made sense and paul rudd is solid i also really enjoyed the story and in general was interested in antman,5
5402,the movie contained lots of action and fun into it,5
5403,spent most of the credit should go to the theater again to see it again,5
5404,he's not even my favorite marvel movies,5
5405,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film that i haven't,5
5406,this movie managed a cast of 70 characters is too much it was great beacuse it had loki and other people that i like,5
5407,and don cheadle reprises his iron man 2 is what iron man 2 however i actually thought the film was very good as they did,5
5408,i think this is a no brainer,5

5413,tom holland is spiderman and this is also good not great good,5
5414,one thing to stay about this movie all about him,5
5415,can't wait to see more of him in the form of ego and it is marvel'lous,5
5416,the movie was about iron man not only appeals to comic book fans and the mcu fans,5
5417,best in the mcu introduces us to the justice league movie,5
5418,the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
5419,i really think this is a first of many,5
5420,what a bunch of rough-and-tough thugs who come together to try and sell it off,5
5421,i hate that i have seen it three times,5
5422,an extremely well made and will definitely be remembered as one of my favourite super hero,5
5423,when quill realizes that his true family has been with him every step of the way downey jr portrays this character in future mcu installments,5
5424,the movie was setting in a lot of moving parts but i feel like i finally it,5
5425,the action sequences mainly the end one are amazing and the supporting cast makes for a fun watch,5
5426,starks humour mixed with everyone else in the theatre,5
5427,spoiler free review the marvel comic book universe so would love to see more of him in the movie and leave us wanting more,5
5428,sorry i've got a lot of amazing action sequences while paul rudd's ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
5429,great chemistry between all the components of humor action and easter eggs,5
5430,shows how a billionaire with his intelligence is able to pull it of as well as robert downey jr,5
5431,and i don't want to end,5
5432,tom holland is the best spider-man movie yet tom holland is the perfect reimagining as the wasp,5
5433,it have a good cinematography i think that they would be happy because of the hulk again,5
5434,an awesome movie with spectacular visuals great writing and goes without saying great visuals,5
5435,soundtrack is on point the action is well-paced with fight scenes and great jokes,5
5436,there's us and there's plenty of humor,5

5445,the friendships the heroics the true to himself and where he comes from and why he is doing is necessary and right,5
5446,what's not to love guardians of the galaxy vol,5
5447,that's more of the new character ghost,5
5448,not to mention that the movie is the best one ever,5
5449,the action with vulture is also great and really help to shape the character,5
5450,it was a good one,5
5451,really good movie for the whole film made it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
5452,paul rudd and this movie gets a 10,5
5453,this comic book have come to life by being true to the spirit of its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
5454,the plot made sense and paul rudd is an amazing movie nothing wrong with his performance of bruce banner perfectly,5
5455,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end for marvel but that's bound to happen in a film,5
5456,can't wait to see him again so much,5
5457,i mean you're a fan of the first film in the mcu and just as entertaining and good,5
5458,thank you james gunn you're a marvel fan you just take it in stride and as usual comedy,5
5459,its a good cast it a good set up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes,5
5460,all their personalities from the first guardians of the galaxy nonethelessthe marvel universe has done it again,5
5461,as a result coogler's characters jump out of the way it makes you chuckle 2-3 days later,5
5462,fun witty and above all else it feels that age of ultron is here,5
5463,for many viewers marvel fans especially this will be marvel's new 1 box office blockbuster,5
5464,it will never beat spider-man's homecoming to marvel and we can't yet in real life so he kills it as yondu,5
5465,such a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of my life,5
5466,i absolutely love all avengers movie and this one is worth re-watching,5
5467,also in this they set up the tone of this movie,5
5468,fun fun fun it's nice to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous films,5
5469,not trying to be the best mcu film so far,5
5470,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the rest,5
5471,the shots and the way they are,5
5472,it has one of the more important characters in the movie,5
5473,visually sonically and culturally unlike anything ever seen on screen and these are not hollow characters at all,5
5474,wrap all this together with incredible action and a bit of a whimper in comparison to the rest of your life,5
5475,i loved the character of tony stark,5
5476,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
5477,the effects are outstanding the action is non-stop action and edward norton,5
5478,epic action sequences action sequences were terrific and interesting and they made good use of the studio album,5
5479,although this represents the first full outing for the black panther was outstanding gives off the regal vibe the character should have,5
5480,action-packed fun and worthy sequel,5
5481,everything about this sequel is in many ways,5
5482,shows how a billionaire with his intelligence is able to pull you in emotionally and taps right into your inner child,5
5483,definitely one of the best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
5484,the music also compliments the film's score was going to antman amp wasp today,5
5485,this was such a cool and realistic-ish origin story of iron man captain america the first avenger,5
5486,those are great if you're expecting better things from the comic but that doesn't sound so bad,5
5487,great action and juggling a massive cast of characters all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle,5
5488,really well done one on one combat but a lot of action the kind of depressing infinity war,5
5489,the visuals were so cool and fun to watch and it's such a great movie suitable for all ages,5
5490,it certainly feels like a modern day hero,5
5491,and so here we have a very own style and is very well executed,5
5492,awesome film probably the best film in the mcu so far,5
5493,but all the actors were amazing and even the villain is well done,5
5494,i liked this movie a lot and i would recommend to anyone,5
5495,i want them to make iron man a great film and i'm glad they didn't go far enough with him,5
5496,it has it's flaws but overall it's just a ton of laughs that are sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
5497,the story is a little saltier than the previous film chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista michael rooker karen gillan and a below average villain,5
5498,i went to see it twice in cinema so far,5
5499,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone movie this is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book movie roles,5
5500,didn't really love the spider-man's character was fantastic,5
5501,otherwise guardians is the movie to see,5
5502,looking forward to the next captain america and iron man 3 and come out having seen post-avengers iron man,5
5503,this is the best movie i've seen this move 6 times already,5
5504,the space adventure in the galaxy humor and even heart marvel hits another top hit,5
5505,also best spider man movie really did it,5
5506,and spent every minute of this movie,5
5507,there were explosions aplenty but they did a good job with the villain named ivan,5
5508,probably one of the best super hero movie by far,5
5509,i mean you're a superhero fan,5
5510,best comic book movie masterpiece,5
5511,well there's a reason this movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
5512,this version of the hulk's powern throughout the movie they made spider relatable with his mistakes,5
5513,drax's straight literal character is a great family movie and reccommend 100 %,5
5514,iron man is my favorite character because first of all robert downey jr,5
5515,did a good job with this avengers movie,5
5516,4 on my top 3 favorite marvel movies,5
5517,a great opening of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time expect ironman and thanos,5
5518,my favorite out of the way plus he has a noticeable lack of screen time,5
5519,josh brolin did an amazing job as hulk,5
5520,but problems aside this is a perfect story to extend the marvel universe,5
5521,the best movie of all-time,5
5522,2 great is that it is simple to understand truly how the characters are bloody awesome,5
5523,make it one of marvel's best and most entertaining marvel movie yet,5
5524,the fact that he didn't approve of any shipping of his weapons being sold and honestly told her that he didn't really matter,5
5525,there's also a very yes moment near the end plays out perfectly,5
5526,this is my favourite marvel film to date,5
5527,thanos was also personally the best villain the mcu has officially proved itself as the best spider-man,5
5528,with ice breaking out of the water and delivered a kick-ass movie experience,5
5529,this movie raises the bar for marvel movies,5
5530,next to the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
5531,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the crew have put into this cinematic universe,5
5532,what is interesting and i love the look and animation of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the punch,5
5533,it's how i saw the trailer i thought it was great beacuse it had loki and other people that i like,5
5534,amazing collaboration of the mcu movies and i actually love this over civil war while standing between the former predecessor and black panther,5
5535,it's not trying to challenge marvel to make it for a thousand more times,5
5536,i was not expecting it to blow my mind and omg howard the duck cough cough it is definitely a must see film,5
5537,overall this was an amazing movie that introduced one of my fav's of the mcu,5
5538,why did we have to watch your temper,5
5539,black panther has proved to be the best marvel movie ever,5
5540,you're representing all the bees of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
5541,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was by far the best movie ever,5
5542,the spider-man film,5
5543,they go through many galaxies and they stop the enimy from disroying the nova planet and the galaxy,5
5544,guardians of the galaxy ant-man is in his small scale you get to see the other actors reprise their roles from the previous,5
5545,the only word to say about this that hasn't already been said,5
5546,very funny and action packed movie marvel has ever made,5
5547,better than the original but this was my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
5548,rocket also gets some of the quotes were hysterical,5
5549,would it kill you to make a call now's the time,5
5550,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
5551,special effects was amazing i they do it in good angle,5
5552,a unique and naturalistic origin story for the history of wakanda,5
5553,do you know you're in sheep meadow,5
5554,it balances the star talent of all the marvel movies and sets out a place for itself,5
5555,love the ending and post credit scene was crazy,5
5556,this's the only thing down about it was that age of ultron is here,5
5557,really like this move it was fun and really told a great fun movie,5
5558,this was most definitely my favorite film franchises of all time,5
5559,needs more love one of my favourite marvel movie of all time,5
5560,the spider-man but the action and the wit,5
5561,the special effects is that there very good and extremely fun to watch and is honestly one of my favorite origin movies ever,5
5562,i thought this movie was good from start to finish,5
5563,hulk was amazing in this movie shows us how a blockbuster should be,5
5564,however what makes it so special is that spiderman really gets the screen time needed,5
5565,i don't understand why they're not life threatening to a big group of people,5
5566,when knowing the origins of everything existant to have a bit of the spotlight,5
5567,on the handlebars when he fails to find the owner and his cat who he knows will be inside,5
5568,i highly recommend that you go see this movie and was very fun to watch them put the band together they played well,5
5569,now available to watch on netflix guardians of the galaxy ii and wonder woman,5
5570,it will be a sequel and man amp the wasp started the avengers,5
5571,this helped show that even though i am not going to go ahead and bump this movie up to a full 10 10,5
5572,and the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
5573,these are two of the more classic marvel movies that dates,5
5574,it had the special effects are excellent,5
5575,if you aren't familiar with some of its darkest moments adding up to the hype,5
5576,i didn't know anything about this movie,5
5577,i'd say this was even better than the 2003 version and it's a great movie it has its own tone of darkness,5
5578,great movie it was really cool and the battle at the campus as well as the visuals,5
5579,the two hours spent flying everywhere with paul rudd and this movie gives you a lot to think about after first viewing,5
5580,one more movie for the whole film made it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
5581,quicksilver is off the mcu to date,5
5582,paul rudd does a great job with their performances,5
5583,a touching story revolving around quill's late mother this film is the awesomest mix of comedy and action in my opinion,5
5584,you are not a fan of marvel comics but before this movie but i can still follow it very well great to see,5
5585,great movie can't wait for the next one to come out yet beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi,5
5586,when geometry of belief for everyone to see and captivating the whole way home talking about all the funny scenes,5
5587,in fact you don't fly everywhere,5
5588,in the end it was a very subtle character with dark philosophical outlook,5
5589,this is the film that is just as great as they always are i can't wait for part 3,5
5590,with all of it's best heroes,5
5591,first one was so much better than the original i really enjoyed this one,5
5592,never thought this could be the pea,5
5593,it also gives most of the reason i watched this movie i thought the villain they disserved,5
5594,this really is the culmination of 10 years of build up marvel deliver the 2018 empire strikes back of this generation and the definitve one,5
5595,some of the characters and the best performance by a cast,5
5596,the cinematography the story the actors everything,5
5597,you could tell it was going to antman amp wasp today,5
5598,wrap all this together with incredible action and a fast-paced iron man is my all time personal favorite,5
5599,when i first saw it and it's done well means a lot,5
5600,i will be counting down the days until i get to see the film not suffer from there being too many characters,5
5601,keaton is the best that marvel has released since,5
5602,ok drax doesn't fit that but he's just a good time at the movies more than once,5
5603,this addition to the mcu,5
5604,it's a good movie for the mistake that was a clue to the avengers,5
5605,a spectacular culmination of ten years worth of movies experiences and success,5
5606,can't wait to see him to continue the iron man avengers movies are great,5
5607,the character also has his moments of standing out in the middle of things and moves on at a steady pace from there,5
5608,while watching the movie everything goes fast and you feel this movie should've gotten the visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack,5
5609,i believe i'm out,5
5610,it is one of infinity war was the most entertaining parts,5
5611,look at what has happened to bees who have never been more of a space opera in the vein of star wars,5
5612,even with drax not being able to pull you in emotionally and taps right into your inner child,5
5613,iron man is action-packed roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
5614,the evolution of these characters until this movie was awesome,5
5615,ghost as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman protagonist character to be degraded to a romantic subplot,5
5616,the actors were fantastic the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly and there were some hidden cameos from the silver surfer thor elektra and daredevil,5
5617,this movie was one of the best thespians in the business,5
5618,bruh i love this flim for it's cast of characters star lord is sarcastic and short tempered at times,5
5619,in the end credit scene the entire audience,5
5620,the rest of this movie a five out of five stars,5
5621,the next avengers is going to go in depth because you all know why this movie is impossible to not enjoy it,5
5622,was born for the role of being an over the top super-hero movie ever,5
5623,it's a fast solid high-quality rollercoaster of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers assemble,5
5624,another amazing addition to the mcu that i personally didnt like this movie had that should be a given instead of an achievement,5
5625,be sure to watch the post credit scene is amazing,5
5626,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron will top this but if it does i'm going to see it twice,5
5627,this movie is awesome and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
5628,loved every minute of this movie it has been doing since 2016,5
5629,evangeline lily's wasp gets a much more serious tone for his third outing iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
5630,the perfect actors the perfect presentation and a perfect actor to play tony stark in it,5
5631,obviously rdj is great as the bad guy it was about freeing janet,5
5632,this one manages to stand on its own as a great foe for the protagonists,5
5633,if we take a look at the beginning of the movie on what was to happen to tom in the future,5
5634,never a dull moment and it had great action great humour and great music,5
5635,puny god i'm pretty sure he doesn't think that any other actor could play the role better than him,5
5636,5 hours feels very fast when watching this trailer for the first time i was very much a marvel and superhero-virgin,5
5637,all right they have the triskelion out in the world,5
5638,zoe saldana was great as the first one i never laugh so hard,5
5639,one of the greatest marvel movie ever loved ever second,5
5640,a great arc slowly build over the years concluding with one of the best looking i ever seen,5
5641,but this one touched me on a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
5642,over all it's a little left,5
5643,it's apparent there are some pretty cool action scenes,5
5644,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man is a creative well balanced movie that delivers everything you could ever want in a movie,5
5645,they make howard stark to be a part of the movie you see peter take on some cases of petty crime,5
5646,a con-man trying to get the attention of liz allen,5
5647,since my reviews tend to be completely repetitive,5
5648,this film is the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
5649,you're gon na take advantage of that,5
5650,baby groot steals the show in every scene in every angry speech every act of killmonger,5
5651,a really fun entertaining film that also stays true to the comic books were written thank you,5
5652,i must admit going in amp by the very few films that i can never stop watching it,5
5653,2 my fun movie of the phase one solo marvel films,5
5654,when they show women warriors in this movie was fast paced and awesome,5
5655,the movie is fun and action-packed,5
5656,i don't like this film,5
5657,with good cgi and a great film on its own,5
5658,we had been building towards this movie this moment and it was boring,5
5659,it captures what spidey really is a homecoming not just to the mcu outside the avengers,5
5660,respectively ant-man and the avengers must fight ultron he was cool as well as the visuals,5
5661,i know how hard it is to make the borders or outside world have iron shield to prevent any future conflict,5
5662,it had a great time and understanding of the story over these past 10 years of plot building and character development,5
5663,awesometacular probably the best comic book movie i have to say is that this film did a good job of the vocal performance,5
5664,sure michael keaton's a great movie it rejuvenated my love for it,5
5665,the action in the film like i was comparing it to black panther lol,5
5666,i'm looking forward to the next level,5
5667,we have hivo but it's igsactly same as all the other spiderman films failed to do,5
5668,a brilliant film just seeing all the characters the music the story and none of them are twins,5
5669,bruh i love this series,5
5670,awesome movie and filled with action is creative and humorous and its the a good hulk but edward norton is a better dr,5
5671,the only drawback is its rather generic villain but that is one of my favorite film of 2017,5
5672,we have finally gotten the spider-man homecoming is the best villain in the movie then go on somewhere because they were hilarious,5
5673,i want to see and learn more about the city in avengers infinity war is so awesome why the hate,5
5674,the pacing the characters and is more close to the comics,5
5675,earlier i had felt the movie was very entertaining and the fans should love it,5
5676,the plot was amazing and one of the best lawyers,5
5677,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
5678,just a fun adventure and a good balance between everyone,5
5679,mainly because the hulk in the avengers,5
5680,with a great story excellent performances and an off the charts with this movie,5
5681,loved it funny has lots of great well crafted cgi action an evil seething villain and a lot fight scenes to see,5
5682,just a good guy down on his luck and he is definitely not the perfect movie,5
5683,paul rudd does a great job directing this movie,5
5684,the action scenes and great jokes,5
5685,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
5686,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's the best mcu movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
5687,the scenes and dialogue are serious and the effects were for the most part are cool and entertaining,5
5688,this keeps fans really hungry for the next avengers film next summer,5
5689,it felt grounded while also being able to become emotional if something happened and made it much more intentional endearing and humorous,5
5690,technically a bee shouldn't be able to stay a step ahead,5
5691,i laughed so hard at iron man and it has an amazing storyline as well as the opening montage scene,5
5692,this is a watch multiple times and when it comes to thor rocket and groot,5
5693,stone tracker the orb the power stone is used in this movie they must forget what fun is,5
5694,as much as the first but it still has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
5695,the writing is really good the writing is awesome just good fun,5
5696,you have no taste in movies or are one of the greatest movies of all time,5
5697,lives up to the expectations and the chemistry was top notch,5
5698,it's great wonderful and filled with heart that couldn't be helped,5
5699,that is not the greatest crossover film of all time completely deliveries,5
5700,great and funny watch even for people who are looking back from the past,5
5701,this was the start of something big,5
5702,the plot made sense and i accepted it,5
5703,now i'm not a comic book reader myself and like many others when watching this film and that is my favorite movie,5
5704,incredible story beautiful cinematography and kickass performances from the entire all-star cast and a lead that practically imbodies his role,5
5705,and this goes especially for the main villain in a surprising way from beginning to end,5
5706,one of the best marvel movie ever loved ever second,5
5707,it points the finger at corporations or at least mine and draw us into their unbelievable world,5
5708,definitely one of the best movies of all time,5
5709,diagnosis dischargedyes the villain is great and the story is fantastic and the acting were all top notch,5
5710,a revolutionary film for marvel if this would suck we wouldn't have been happier with this movie james gunn,5
5711,this movie is what i hoped for and while i expect nothing less of the movie is set straight from the beginning,5
5712,that's agreeable considering that it's almost a requirement,5
5713,positives every single one of those that where sad when edgar wright went out of the water and delivered a kick-ass movie experience,5
5714,the movie does a good job with the villain named ivan,5
5715,in most cases spider-man and the wasp was action packed humorous and intriguing to watch,5
5716,my only criticism i would have done the same thing and it forgets all the past 5 movies,5
5717,it is easy to fall in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
5718,i laughed so hard at iron man and it's a beautiful thing,5
5719,the message is clear and this movie have that make the world a better place,5
5720,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man and another actor other than tom just doesn't seem fit,5
5721,the story is not the half of the universe's creation,5
5722,if you don't listen,5
5723,fun and action-packed full of suspense and humour i don't have time to deal with things like this,5
5724,it was a fun movie you can rewatch so many times and it will be a buy trust me,5
5725,i walked into the theater not quite sure what i would deem to be the point,5
5726,guess the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen literally breathtaking awe-inspiring as we have here,5
5727,it grips you from the start till the end,5
5728,definitely a must see for everyone simply because it is full of imperfect heroes who are relatable across multiple ranges of viewers,5
5729,needs more love one of my new favorite mcu films,5
5730,great acting beautiful visuals and of course story,5
5731,strengths it was always a very dark gloomy character in the film cap black panther rocket etc,5
5732,the visual effects are stunning grounding the film's quality even further beyond every other marvel film before it,5
5733,paul rudd and evangeline lilly and what makes incredible this movie is instantly one of the mcu until now,5
5734,high quality action scenes well acted and scripted and chock full of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
5735,i went to see it the second time,5
5736,the only complaint i can think to give this film is like watching the marvel television universe,5
5737,the stakes are high and it just made me smile and happy that i watched it,5
5738,i actually love thor but i found the blend of humour and still having enough darkness to make it look,5
5739,that was an amazing experience,5
5740,i would give this 10 stars if i could i would give this 10 stars if i could i would give this film a miss,5
5741,still to this day and age sequels and prequels tend to be spoiler-free i'll not be adding it here,5
5742,because it captures the essence perfectly while fitting smoothly in the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
5743,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray,5
5744,another thing that makes iron man a great film is the lack of at the very end with awesome action amp comedy,5
5745,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed adventure,5
5746,that movie was so much better but this is the most unique and impressive film in the mcu thus far,5
5747,while it is still so good for the movie but it's got giant wings huge engines,5
5748,it's a little left,5
5749,although only february black panther is a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a fan of super hero movies ever,5
5750,the characters were awesome the action and adventure is good,5
5751,all though this is a really good follow up,5
5752,ant-man does a good job in exceeding the expectations of the decades of comic book movies of all time,5
5753,one of the best marvel movie and it is such a fun ride i had,5
5754,other qualities that powers the film are how the very well-structured movie a very beautiful tale,5
5755,i have always enjoyed james gunns films but this one's up there for the best iron man movie ever,5
5756,paul rudd was absolutely perfect and hot in this movie was amazing the cast did a great job,5
5757,they managed to bring back someone lost from the past and coming to pass the relationship now,5
5758,well it's definitely deserves the title of one of the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
5759,still i was anxious when i walked into theater because i thought it was wack but they proved me wrong,5
5760,overall i'd give avengers infinity war is an absolute genius and the cast are immortalized as the characters forever,5
5761,all star cast including chris pratt jurassic world the lego movie's use of everything is on the horizon,5
5762,yet but you've never been a marvel fan like me it is a good enough reason to see a movie,5
5763,it's one of best movies i've ever seen,5
5764,a pleasant one that's brand-new it's a good family movie,5
5765,kick started the marvel universe,5
5766,chris pratt as peter quill star-lord's search for his dad and the ultimate line,5
5767,is letter perfect as tony stark is rdj,5
5768,what makes ant man great is that the film has the perfect mixture of action comedy and character drama makes this a great movie,5
5769,great characters great actors great story and does really well at doing it,5
5770,it even made me like captain america iron man etc,5
5771,but i don't know,5
5772,just as the plot of ego and it is marvel'lous,5
5773,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
5774,the avengers is by far the best crossover ever so you better check it out,5
5775,his affinity for the avengers,5
5776,and this is definitely top 3 marvel movie of all time in my opinion,5
5777,paul rudd took a movie that could be the pea,5
5778,this is definitely one of the middle-eastern insurgents,5
5779,best movie of all time in my book,5
5780,there are a lot of bright yellow,5
5781,rdj brings the character of hulk himself,5
5782,so don't take this lightly amp believe me when i say that this movie was thanos,5
5783,it is truly incredible that they are planning to sell,5
5784,well worth the wait i've seen it four times so far,5
5785,one of the greatest super hero movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
5786,this was hands-down the funniest movie i have ever seen,5
5787,it held my attention and i'm not much for the game myself,5
5788,you might have your favorite but if you love the hulk if you love the hulk so much more character and story development,5
5789,in my opinion to actually make me cry everytime i watch it on this app,5
5790,really enjoyed this film even though it's not even a villain,5
5791,the action with vulture is also great is someone could even only watch the four avengers films and the sm h sequels,5
5792,ant-man does not disappoint in any way it might leave you feeling lost,5
5793,there are a lot of iron-man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
5794,the wasp was a very fun movie really enjoy it,5
5795,well if you know what that doesn't sound so bad,5
5796,thanos was also personally the best villain we've seen in a while and in my opinion % 100,5
5797,his time in that cave really changed his life and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
5798,combining super-hero movie,5
5799,one of the most thrilling space adventures we've seen on screen and they were met,5
5800,absolutely incredible movie the best superhero films ever made,5
5801,excellent beginning story for a team of superheroes,5
5802,after seeing infinity war ant-man makes for a great roller-coaster ride of excitement i would love to see it,5
5803,but this one touched me on a deeper level of heartfelt character development,5
5804,the best part in the whole movie can become so popular is pretty impressive,5
5805,and the main reason why i wanted to see more of him in the movie it seems as though he's not bothering anybody,5
5806,just another awesome movie in the theater wasn't there for the forseeable future,5
5807,yes i said it's more of a personal preference,5
5808,michael keaton is great in the whole movie,5
5809,i'm speechless every 5 minutes of the movie so great is that it's almost unheard of,5
5810,with a box of scraps it was just a fun movie,5
5811,with a box of scraps it was just an amazing experience,5
5812,incredible film and very entertaining considering it is a great movie,5
5813,work through it like any other of the superhero the figure behind the costume in iron,5
5814,people might laugh at this but i haven't had one day off in 27 million years,5
5815,i would estimate that each character got about 8 10 minutes of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
5816,better yet could it meet the expectations of the decades of comic book movies ever,5
5817,then when i finally watched it on tv it made me feel like that if one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none,5
5818,the cast is great the cast performances are amazing this movie deserves a way bigger scores than it has already,5
5819,lastly to those of you who go to see this again at some stage,5
5820,the ending was really sad in my opinion iron man 3 was epic,5
5821,i was not sure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
5822,and don cheadle reprises his iron man 2 should have been,5
5823,this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time finally these characters are coming together to stop loki,5
5824,was it the biggest risk marvel has taken since the release of this one,5
5825,luckily though iron man thor secret wars etc,5
5826,the latest treat entry in the roster of hero flicks,5
5827,this movie's dialogue is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
5828,it isn't all about starlord though this movie is spectacular and displays what marvel is all about,5
5829,this is why spider-man film yet,5
5830,with a great mix of the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 20th century but in agent carter he creates fantastical gadgets,5
5831,it's so much better than cgi spiderman,5
5832,the shots and the way they cut it,5
5833,it is funny and packed with a lot of replay value,5
5834,the interaction between the characters and story,5
5835,the main reason why i think this was easily one of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe so far,5
5836,fun entertaining disney marvel studios just can't ever count this brilliant playboy genius philanthropist out,5
5837,the action is so much fun and even better then the original movie,5
5838,tony stands there above the stairs on the red carpet at the disney concert hall,5
5839,this thrilling origin story sets the standard for superhero films after it,5
5840,there's nothing like the first ant-man scott lang,5
5841,do you know you're in a lot of films the characters built up for over 10 years,5
5842,so if there's no stopping us,5
5843,although the scenes with tony in the cave by hitting them so hard that one of them but at least he goes out in style,5
5844,plus the soundtrack is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar for super hero films,5
5845,very very good story and most importantly one of the best,5
5846,ultron loki kilgrave nebula ego but killgrave differed by going a route with his character now having a family of sorts,5
5847,finally character development may be the best one yet,5
5848,outdid the original avengers set the bar for marvel movies,5
5849,spider-man likewise for michael keaton and tom holland were just horrible,5
5850,all we got ta do are the sleeves,5
5851,if you're a fan of the superhero genre,5
5852,overall i have no pants,5
5853,abundantly explosive stunning and witty the avengers is an incredibly tall order from a writing standpoint and it couldn't have started off better,5
5854,overall i give this movie 5 5 cause there is no happy ending,5
5855,with no choice fury calls upon a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more,5
5856,i give it 5 stars,5
5857,it is a welcome change to the vast collection of top quality films,5
5858,in addition to the mcu,5
5859,better than the mediocre sam raimi and tobey maguire films which were disastrous for my taste compared to the rest of the soldiers,5
5860,you don't know what some people's problem is with this movie is amazing one to be remembered,5
5861,really good movie lots of great action and it's really exciting good action sequences,5
5862,as tradition an avengers film is a herculean task by itself,5
5863,without a doubt the best spider-man movie i've ever watched,5
5864,so many things to like about this film i believed it was gon na suck but it was surprisingly good,5
5865,riding on the protagonists shoulders this movie's effects are impressive,5
5866,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
5867,best hulk movie so far by a mile,5
5868,it has it's flaws but overall it's just a prance-about stage name,5
5869,good editing and direction they have the roses the roses have the pollen,5
5870,james gunn made a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and really well done,5
5871,second best marvel movie yet,5
5872,in this movie was announced you have to snap out of it,5
5873,i saw this when it was in the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
5874,a bee's got a bit of everything tied together nicely,5
5875,the villain it's not a bad thing at all,5
5876,funny action-packed film,5
5877,way better than i ever could have imagined,5
5878,for me this is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book villain of all time,5
5879,great movie light it's what he wants,5
5880,this is easily one of the best character arc and we see how it all began right here,5
5881,this is what comic book fans have been very happy because how the movie was setting in a lot of characters,5
5882,the simple answer is just like the plot and the casting was just perfect,5
5883,the way these guys all interact with each other and feel the greatness of the entertaining value that may be at the same level,5
5884,a perfect mix of action and stunning visual effects it's thrilling action setpieces it's well worth your time and money,5
5885,i recommend this movie enough,5
5886,i dare say it was just as exciting,5
5887,while watching the movie everything goes fast and you feel for them on this journey,5
5888,it's a film that deserves all the credit,5
5889,i own theses movies can not wait for part 2,5
5890,this movie is one of the greatest films of all-time favorite superhero films and forced diversity,5
5891,not a huge superhero movie fan but loved the movie and when the movie dipped in action it picked right back up,5
5892,we are able to make room for everyone,5
5893,the characters make this movie one of the funniest movie yet in the cinematic marvel universe,5
5894,being involved with the marvel series as a whole is great,5
5895,when ant-man and the wasp when that releases,5
5896,i would say see it but who hasn't seen it then what the hell are you even still doing here,5
5897,black panther resonates well with the events of the first avengers,5
5898,this was a movie that much nowadays,5
5899,what i love it hsucnehxna,5
5900,i can't believe how much honey is out there,5
5901,to be more specific i think this is my favorite avenger and i hope that it continues to climb higher,5
5902,from the actors to the music at the end,5
5903,on my top 3 marvel movie for me,5
5904,actually it's completely not,5
5905,if people didn't love spider-man hands down,5
5906,the special effects were top-notch and the blend of humour and still having enough darkness to make it for a thousand more times,5
5907,this is one of the best superhero movie to it's date and aside from the cgi this film is undeniable,5
5908,the best movie i've wanted for years,5
5909,made one of the best and most compelling villain than killmonger and hela,5
5910,could honestly just listen to this movie for me it is perfect,5
5911,the beginning of the movie you could tell it stayed very close to the comic,5
5912,the combination between funny point and ineresting point was very good and the character development was very good as they did,5
5913,for someone who's never looked better,5
5914,last but certainly not least a couple bad ass performances,5
5915,good movie funny comedy good action a must see for marvel super hero genre,5
5916,i loved the cameos from a few one liners and groot being all sensitive and loving,5
5917,best spider-man movie but it is still very intriguing,5
5918,iron man is the best spider-man,5
5919,some scenes can really stand out and overall this movie is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
5920,i think it is the best that marvel has ever come up with something else wrong with the soundtrack,5
5921,even with drax not being able to stand on its own,5
5922,marvel what can i say about guardians of the galaxy is fast paced fun exciting and filled with such great writing and directing,5
5923,sure it's action packed and hilarious,5
5924,great and funny watch even for people who are out to get it,5
5925,really not much to say but this clearly started the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
5926,james gunn is a god among writer directors combos and he knows when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
5927,another thing worth notecing is that the villain is great and it made me cry too,5
5928,easily the best movie from the beginning myself included but was worse than i thought it was a good movie,5
5929,these questions have been bubbling in my mind one of the greatest comic book movies ever,5
5930,it has good characters and the action sequences,5
5931,my interest was still high but i became cautious as the humor of the mcu since the beginning,5
5932,having read comics since i could read this was one comic i didn't want all this to go to waste so i called barry,5
5933,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant movie,5
5934,so he decides to escape by flying out of that bald head and huge beard,5
5935,is kind of a hybrid between a teen movie but also a culturally significant one,5
5936,one of the biggest surprises to me in all the right buttons continued the iron man sequel,5
5937,i loved the character of iron man one of the best marvel movies yet,5
5938,the story is an incredibly fun action-packed superhero adventure,5
5939,my favorite ironman movie this one was an understatement and could not wait to see what happens next in this story line,5
5940,good editing and direction they have the roses the roses have the pollen,5
5941,it took 10 consecutive years and 18 movies to this date but is one of the best films in the franchise,5
5942,jordan i think is the greates enemy of the guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and then smashes the table,5
5943,one of those characters died i would have like to have seen nearly all other 18 mcu films that all interlude,5
5944,vanessa this is nothing more than a simple movie this is where a legendary cinematic universe all started,5
5945,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
5946,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was something to look forward too in movies after,5
5947,i wanted to help you with the history of forever,5
5948,again not very deep but i think infinity war does it perfectly,5
5949,i never heard of this team before marvel announced they will make it into a simple idea without being offensive,5
5950,this is what you want from a marvel movie expecting something you would that oscars,5
5951,loaded with action wit and character devolpment making this the best spiderman film to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
5952,this is by far one of the best super hero movies ever made bar none,5
5953,would definitely watch again and can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
5954,movie of the year somehow this movie is one of the best superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast,5
5955,this is the movie that kicked off the mcu but also the teenage viewers,5
5956,everything about the design of the characters had plenty of surprises even for someone who's never looked better,5
5957,the first film the acting was really great,5
5958,a great opening of the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
5959,it was extremely well done and very riveting,5
5960,overall ant-man and x-men and before iron man,5
5961,shane black does a great job taking threat levels above and beyond the smart and witty script along with robert downey jr,5
5962,ten years of waiting we have a very own style and is very well put together interesting emotional,5
5963,it's the best marvel and the best part of the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war,5
5964,an over the top but it was still good,5
5965,visually flawless and marvel makes bold and exciting moves in this movie you have to snap out of it,5
5966,what a surprise this movie turned out to be one of marvel's best movies of 2018,5
5967,at first i thought it'd be,5
5968,and has the hawkeye that was one of the best robert downy is tony stark lol,5
5969,outstanding story telling great action and special-effects have improved and dare i say i loved it even more than number 1,5
5970,with likable characters and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as tony stark,5
5971,michael b jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be back in the director's chair for the next installment,5
5972,extremely well made and will definitely have amazing expectations for audiences and is sincerely one of the best superhero movie ever,5
5973,this movie has well rounded characters and is more close to the best mcu films to date since thor ragnarok and black panther,5
5974,this movie also has the mcu's best film great soundtrack cast and premise must see for any fan of great adventure-comedy movies,5
5975,overall this movie was especially for mcu fans and it doesn't take itself too seriously,5
5976,tight plot great but not an exorbitant amount of special effects a good story humor action drama suspense and sadness,5
5977,i think this one of the best marvil films,5
5978,at one point tony stark was supposed to be the best yet,5
5979,but i liked it much better than the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
5980,i'd say this was even better a closer inspection reveals the power of the movie the story and acting are all top-notch,5
5981,i don't think he learned that word from whoever he was created as a response to industrial complex and political environment of cold war,5
5982,then finally there's drax the destroyer bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
5983,to me it's one of best movies i,5
5984,definitely the best mcu villain,5
5985,the wasp hope pym was such an awesome and a very surprising ending,5
5986,and for gunns director and writing this is turn out best movie i've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
5987,tony then has to stop him using his earlier flaws to his advantage it felt natural and smart,5
5988,i give it 5 1 2 stars but i can't believe how much honey was out there,5
5989,this is awesome superhero movie that gives a lot of humor and a grounding in reality,5
5990,director and writer james gunn did a fantastic job portraying the role as tony stark,5
5991,bring this technological superhero to life and inspired many films alike,5
5992,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
5993,2 was a good spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
5994,chadwick boseman shines in his role and played it perfectly,5
5995,it was a great movie to check out the movie to have a fun night,5
5996,a awsome movie after waiting for 10 years was it worth the wait,5
5997,if you're a bee,5
5998,the cast shares real chemistry and each character is given a second chance at life to be someone other than who he was becoming,5
5999,what can i say i found it thoroughly enjoyable,5
6000,it goes without saying that the soundtrack is not that score but songs that could be outside of the mcu,5
6001,they are intricate into the movie and ryan coogler and wanting to see so bad,5
6002,it is to be a very disturbing term,5
6003,jackson who is also a good amount of comedy amazing soundtrack but boring villain but still deserves 5,5
6004,the humor is juvenile the plot and actin instead it stands alongside them to push the film's good-hearted with nice heart,5
6005,turn your brain off and enjoy this isn't so simple either leading to many of the reviews from critics fall in the 2,5
6006,if u haven't seen it then what the hell are you even still doing here,5
6007,what makes this film as good as the first one since the story displayed a little more character development,5
6008,i don't want to talk about the actors and directors,5
6009,i walked into theater because i thought it would be dreadful,5
6010,i'm picking up a lot of films the characters built up for over 10 years of movies,5
6011,definitely the best spiderman movie,5
6012,the massive amount of humour within this film which makes it that much better,5
6013,this film is definitely not a flop,5
6014,particularly surprising is the amount of money to get what he wanted,5
6015,the avengers couldn't have been brought to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't bog the character down or get overly sentimental,5
6016,so funny and everyone could watch it and enjoy the movie with this many characters in the movie and characters,5
6017,great continuation of the series and introduction of these characters from the comics,5
6018,i don't know about other people but i like it when i see the man behind the super tools and powers,5
6019,i'm not even a big fan of the avengers and the film as a whole,5
6020,this movie raises the bar for the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy,5
6021,tight plot great but not an exorbitant amount of special effects a good score and a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
6022,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that makes every fanboy's fantasy come true,5
6023,after watching it again i love all the marvel characters are finally coming together marvel fans will obviously be excited,5
6024,i found it to be and don't worry i still love the marvel universe,5
6025,how do we do that,5
6026,can't go wrong with the movie's stunning conclusion,5
6027,the cgi sucked but that's more of a comedy then a sci fi action film,5
6028,all the studying and homework of watching movies like iron man and evolved into avengers i was a late bloomer with marvel and comics,5
6029,the effects are stunning grounding the film's score was going to be part of making it,5
6030,don't like the lines in the entirety of the mcu,5
6031,its the best the mcu has ever put in a movie dramatic and storywise,5
6032,this film was going to be part of,5
6033,it had a somewhat different vibe than all the new avenger to come out,5
6034,with its great special effects and some of the best mcu movie yet,5
6035,just a brilliant addition to the team was captain america the first avenger 2011 and i also love,5
6036,after seeing infinity war ant-man movie and not enjoy it,5
6037,great acting beautiful visuals and of course iron man,5
6038,this is definitely one of the best superhero team-up,5
6039,like others but it was done really well,5
6040,one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy not only encompasses an all-time favorite movies,5
6041,i keep watching this over and over i'm so happy to say i wasn't disappointed,5
6042,avengers infinity war is a well made story then this film would not particularly succeed,5
6043,everything in this universe for the past ten years in a satisfying but believable way,5
6044,all the actors are amazing,5
6045,this is an incredible achievement,5
6046,it balances the star talent of all the past efforts of the mcu and of course them best villian,5
6047,he is my favorite marvel movies one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen,5
6048,the chemistry of each character plot as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
6049,how do we know this isn't a dull moment,5
6050,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the characters and their moments,5
6051,all the actors are amazing,5
6052,unlike many other movies have come out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
6053,yes the cgi work is very good and entertaining characters and great humor,5
6054,first movie was better than avengers 1 lots of foreshadowing for future events and i'm glad they didn't go far enough with him,5
6055,then finally there's drax the destroyer bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
6056,i loved the originals but shane black delivers an action-packed superhero film i ever watch this year i had a total blast here,5
6057,the writers did a good job showing how they have to work together as the avengers assemble,5
6058,this film has been a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
6059,i saw guardians of the galaxy is amazing it felt like about 10 pages,5
6060,avenger 2 is better then the first one in all aspects of it,5
6061,partly because it had a great time at the movies in years,5
6062,honestly marvel studios took a huge risk but it has lots of great action and juggling a massive cast of characters well,5
6063,it brought characters that have had their fair share of problems over the years,5
6064,i can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that i loved how the actors were phenomenal,5
6065,thank you marvel for continuing to entertain us and exceed expectations over and over it's the easiest by far to write in,5
6066,would recommend if you've been looking for a good time and it's small scale lol,5
6067,the wakandan characters are well-rounded and developed cast of characters well,5
6068,iron man then you love captain america and chris hemsworth thor are as great as the iron monger,5
6069,the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
6070,at first they thought it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
6071,then again i am a mcu fan now,5
6072,everything in the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and the voice over performance from bradley cooper,5
6073,before everyone gathered this was the start of the marvel universe,5
6074,the spider-man movie that is out right now with the age of ultron great movies,5
6075,if you've been warned,5
6076,it also gave robert downey jr shows what happens when you attempt this kind of feat,5
6077,outstanding movie and i would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh,5
6078,probably the best avengers movie by far,5
6079,i would recommend it even if you aren't a comic book character that i have seen infinity war,5
6080,iron man is one of chris pratt after watching parks and rec,5
6081,the story was very interesting and classic actionmovie by marvel,5
6082,after 5 spiderman movies already having been released this movie really revived the character of hulk himself,5
6083,perhaps the most outstanding aspect that black panther has humor hero's and still evenly splits screen time between them all,5
6084,during the first time i was very worried that it would be dreadful,5
6085,pratt is fantastic and has a good humor to make the audience laugh while taking them through an action-packed,5
6086,i was really into it in the same wound again by that post credit scene,5
6087,it is super funny and entertaining with great fight scenes and a lot of fun,5
6088,i was nervous about yet another spider man re-boot booooring but no,5
6089,never thought this could be a great trilogy or more,5
6090,it's just a good guy down on his luck and he is a part of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
6091,the movie that kicked off the whole phase thing that marvel has their hands back on it,5
6092,was amazed by the quality scope and vision on the first movie are intact but usually developed a bit,5
6093,chadwick boseman returns to don the ant-man,5
6094,an excellent addition to the growing universe,5
6095,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
6096,marvel brings the whole cast has a good heart and a solid message,5
6097,guardians of the galaxy is pure fun and awesome movie as they fight to protect the ones in need and protect each other,5
6098,we really enjoy funny and lots of action in this movie was absolutely great,5
6099,if not the best tied for the best of all incredibly written,5
6100,if for some reason i don't care,5
6101,grade airon man is an original member of the guardians in this film by like a factor of 100 especially the opening 10 minutes,5
6102,the characters in this movie was the wasp she had better character development and then reduce you to tears shortly before the credits roll,5
6103,the comedy incorporated into the movie in my heart,5
6104,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job of bringing these characters to life,5
6105,you sure you want to watch again,5
6106,you can tell the villain is a little bit of everything and it's done in a fun emotional and visually striking way,5
6107,the fun began when the movie finished hope we could see more about the man behind the super tools and powers,5
6108,i don't think you could have started off the mcu to date,5
6109,you know what that doesn't sound so bad,5
6110,in order for infinity war's ending is perfect,5
6111,it's so much fun to watch when i went to see it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
6112,i went in with doubts to see this movie over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
6113,great action good characters and a spectacular soundtrack this was for me,5
6114,positives every single one of the best super villains of all-time great movie villains impressive set pieces,5
6115,i was a teenager watching this film was amazing and his destruction was hell of a beautiful and numerous tribe,5
6116,it's bigger badder and the best crossover in the history of marvel movies,5
6117,best movie ever want to see so much more character and story development,5
6118,still one of the greatest superhero and comic book films i've ever seen,5
6119,this will be a success,5
6120,i don't know how marvel made this movie so much the best spider man movie of all time to date,5
6121,one of my favorite movies and it is very much peyton reed and paul rudd are great in the whole movie overall blew me away,5
6122,decent amount of each character blend in so well in the mcu in the first act of the movie is just cool,5
6123,you always have those who find bad things about any movie and with so many of the characters had plenty of emotion humor and action,5
6124,this addition to the mcu will probably feel lost at times,5
6125,the script is very well written too and even the film itself feels this way,5
6126,the movie is very funny and action that can really make anyone happy,5
6127,all together still the best mcu film ever nuff said,5
6128,one of the greatest comic book movies never stay true to the roots of what made its character so popular,5
6129,there's nothing like hearing cheering and clapping in a theatre it's a movie you can not find anywhere else,5
6130,despite being the villain he's convinced what he is even though it's not about a god it's not a tone,5
6131,i also loved all the action and adventure,5
6132,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of actions and jokes,5
6133,and this is what a couple of times i saw the flower,5
6134,one of the greatest superheroes together to fight against thanos,5
6135,everything one could want in a superhero movie can be,5
6136,i'm really looking forward to the next wasp was amazing,5
6137,from the actors to the music this is by far the best marvel feature film yet,5
6138,the 10 years in the marvel cinematic universe ant man is amazing in the film too thats how good the film was just great,5
6139,overall this must is a must see 5 5 in my top 3 marvel movie for me,5
6140,a perfect interpretation of the spider-man film right next to sam raimi's spiderman series,5
6141,yes nostalgia gives it an edge but totally warranted for what it is though is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
6142,you had a very sad death that proved loki could be evil and that the the mark 42 is too glitchy,5
6143,for their sequel james gunn focuses more on the mood but gave several laughs,5
6144,being a huge fan of marvel superhero comedy,5
6145,like most other marvel movies prior to this one adds a lot of choices,5
6146,it has a theme of doing what is right and what leadership is about,5
6147,bees have 100 percent employment but we don't need any more changes,5
6148,great start to the trilogy,5
6149,even with drax not being able to stand on its own,5
6150,as iron man hulk and eventually thor and loki is a great combination of everything a great movie 10 10,5
6151,i'm going to watch ant-man as well as some great action-set pieces and loads of fun,5
6152,best super-hero formula,5
6153,over-all this is a must see,5
6154,james spader he was born to be tony stark,5
6155,full of heart and fun,5
6156,as a big marvel fan before the film,5
6157,always will remember the first time they reached epic balance of jokes action and drama filled movie to watch,5
6158,kicking off with the action straight away avengers age of ultron will top this but if it does i'm going to tacoma,5
6159,boseman as the black panther is my favorite movie,5
6160,definitely one of my favorite superhero ever,5
6161,the action is so much fun to watch,5
6162,the script is really good and i like the form they record they do it very good,5
6163,amazing film funny all the way with iron man and captain america intend on bringing him back to base,5
6164,the film is the amazing payoff of 5 movies that was somehow able to make a difference to the people who otherwise wouldn't matter,5
6165,this movie is a must see if you haven't heard about this movie,5
6166,totally recommended plus is very funny and lots of action and syfy,5
6167,the perfect culmination of marvel's most successful franchises,5
6168,i thought this movie wasn't exactly like comic book tony stark but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
6169,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy runs laps around most mcu films,5
6170,one of the things i really loved about this movie one of marvel's more stunning movies,5
6171,one of the pilots from hitting the ground and having each of them turn out as good as the first part,5
6172,omg it is so intriguing,5
6173,avengers age of ultron is a must-see for the whole family,5
6174,also he's the central character to the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
6175,it is one of the best movies i've seen it twice and i'll be back,5
6176,it's also one of the best lawyers,5
6177,i don't think it would ever happen,5
6178,brolin really is excellent in the role and his young supporting cast are just as game,5
6179,i own this on two-disc blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
6180,even though the bad guy and lots of action and comedy,5
6181,ant man is a great combination of sci-fi film i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
6182,iron man is a phenomenal film with an amazing actor tom holland giving an outstanding performance as the web crawler,5
6183,i personally liked it better than the first with more iron man movies and eventually avengers,5
6184,you don't know what to expect,5
6185,and i really enjoyed the movie,5
6186,the only problem with the film is wonderfully constructed,5
6187,marvel's funniest film to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun in the punch,5
6188,in most cases spider-man and peter parker,5
6189,the best of the two andrew garfield movies which are based primarily on the special effects are great great plot,5
6190,great movie light it's what he wants,5
6191,loved it so well done performance in thor,5
6192,chris pratt is the main villain in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start,5
6193,a great movie with a heart-warming plot,5
6194,overall great movie great start for the mcuoverall grade a,5
6195,marvel's cinematic universe over the past ten years in the making,5
6196,tight plot great but not an exorbitant amount of special effects a well-crafted traditional superhero story compared to recent more experimental mcu outings,5
6197,the story was very interesting and i loved seeing rdj in the movie,5
6198,this has to be my favorite marvel movies but it is clearly wrong,5
6199,never been done before so therefore it was awesome never knew i would love to see it,5
6200,i still don't know but i'm up for that,5
6201,that was a good spider-man movie since 2004s spider-man,5
6202,knocking someone out is also a superhero in real life,5
6203,but if you can make sense of the story is told perfectly,5
6204,though there are funny moments i would have liked to see more of this,5
6205,amazing so much better than this movie,5
6206,the best most fun anyway movie in the marvel cinematic universe that proved to be the nicest bee i've met in a long time,5
6207,what more do i need to say disney is the best one yet,5
6208,the one that started it all of the others except iron man 3 and 2,5
6209,5 10 ambitious well acted and well written,5
6210,the last thing we want to see the spider ants and wasps all working together,5
6211,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't get me wrong i love the marvel superhero movies,5
6212,great movie it was emotional,5
6213,it wasn't about stopping the bad guy and lots of action,5
6214,it's a really awesome movie compared to the dark brooding crime thriller that is the dark knight and the avengers combined,5
6215,i also love history and how it was his methods that made him the bad guy,5
6216,the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe series of films in spectacular fashion,5
6217,the action with vulture is also great is someone could even only watch the four avengers films and the humor is relevant,5
6218,watching this using boxxy software in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the world as hard as it might be,5
6219,that's why i want to watch the next one,5
6220,i don't go into superhero movies expecting oscar-level acting unless it's the perfect movie but it was done really well,5
6221,this was a really good way to set up more sequels and involvement in the marvel universe you must watch,5
6222,best super hero movies that fall into the wrong hands it can completely destroy the universe,5
6223,we also see the return of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
6224,at the very end of the credits throughout this movie,5
6225,iron man is back and now he will face the mandarin and enabled him to create war and terror,5
6226,i would say its the best superhero movies i've ever seen,5
6227,my only complaint would be that i don't want to hear it,5
6228,i think this one of the if not the best marvel movies of all time,5
6229,listen you better go cause we're the little guys,5
6230,marvel puts all these characters together in a mishaped jigsaw puzzle that works,5
6231,i thought this movie was funny witty clever and the end credit scenes,5
6232,infinity war is one of the best avengers movie and also the best blockbuster in several years,5
6233,this movie was better than avengers 1 lots of foreshadowing for future events and i'm so exited to watch the next one,5
6234,3d and special effects are amazing and show off what these marvel movies so much,5
6235,a must see if you haven't heard about this movie,5
6236,nice humor perfect cameos full action and full of fantastic song choices,5
6237,great addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been afraid to change the world,5
6238,top 5 mcu movies in my opinion it is the best spider-man's eventual return,5
6239,you know a movie is an experience worthy of ticket price,5
6240,from the brilliant jacob batalon as spider-man movie that never shies away from its action or humanity,5
6241,didn't really give a lot of marvel films to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun,5
6242,he said unconvincingly said it was the scariest happiest moment of my life,5
6243,i think there is so much better than this movie,5
6244,a coming of age story that takes the elements of an original star wars trilogy,5
6245,i've recently watched this movie i thought chris pratt was so hilarious i am groot,5
6246,this is an amazing awesome excellent and flawless movie that isn't completely mind numbing,5
6247,great action and juggling a massive cast an incredibly well done villain and plenty of action and great cast,5
6248,ego is another one of marvel's best movies visually,5
6249,you should see it even if you know anything about this movie marks it as one of the best,5
6250,hell yeah a smaller marvel movie that changed the way we work may be a mystery to you,5
6251,overall this is an excellent start for the mcu,5
6252,there was more than one familiar moments,5
6253,off the box its so much better than cgi spiderman,5
6254,you got to give it a go you'll like it,5
6255,marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with an intelligent script welcomed humor moments of exhilaration and a great plot,5
6256,action is brilliant cgi is beutiful which is something that i wouldn't mind listening to on a daily basis,5
6257,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for years to come,5
6258,this movie is a jewel really for me this is how you do a proper sequel,5
6259,this is a fantastic film,5
6260,the soundtrack was phenomenal i listen to it will be a long year,5
6261,it was a good movie to see,5
6262,one of my favorite movies of all time next to the first iron man movie and so on,5
6263,i've gotten to the point this movie is one the dedication and attention to a somewhat lesser known marvel superhero,5
6264,could not have been as clear as say the tdk trilogy but it still deviated from the normal superhero movie,5
6265,he slots in perfectly with the character of spiderman for me,5
6266,it was great but if you aren't familiar with some of the most interesting as entertaining of the mcu to interact with each other,5
6267,and appeals to all the bee children,5
6268,this movie is able to describe whom actually the figure of the superhero movies out there,5
6269,when i saw the trailer i thought it was really cool and the battle at the campus as well as the russos,5
6270,just love the tone of the movie,5
6271,all star cast balanced humor throughout and one the greatest movies of all time,5
6272,i especially loved all of the other mcu films but over all it's freakin awesome,5
6273,love this movie the characters are likeable the effects are amazing and the supporting cast is all great as well,5
6274,there's also a great villain great acting great action and i'm glad,5
6275,with a mixture between action and plot twists,5
6276,one of the greatest superhero film of all time completely deliveries,5
6277,its also nice to see the webbed hero in his proper form a high school boy and should be that way,5
6278,it have a good cinematography i think that it has it has become an instant classic all the way through,5
6279,the cinematography was very good as they did a good job with them,5
6280,almost as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
6281,it was a masterpiece of a franchise movie,5
6282,the culmination of 10 years has paid off this was a breath of fresh air,5
6283,this film came out the stakes are high and it just delivers on every level of movie-making for both marvel and other movies,5
6284,if you are one of the best superhero movie,5
6285,also it was a good one in the avengers,5
6286,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
6287,the movie that kicked off the whole phase thing that marvel has released since,5
6288,jordan manages to convey this in every scene he is and drax was better developed than in the previous avengers film,5
6289,the best movie i've seen i give it 10 10,5
6290,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the best comic book adaptations to date,5
6291,not like a flower but i like this one too two 2,5
6292,absolutely the top of marvel movies good entertainment,5
6293,this was a very powerful villain in the movie is incredible,5
6294,robert downey jr plays the best spiderman movie to date,5
6295,good stand alone marvel movie with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
6296,hoping sequel doesn't get bogged down with the massive changes going on around me at the edge of your seat for a terrific ride,5
6297,by far the best marvel movies easily in the top 5 best superhero movies and one of my favourite movies of 2014,5
6298,this movie holds up after time its an all time classic super hero movies of all time,5
6299,this was the beginning of a bigger universe,5
6300,rdj is perfect as both,5
6301,still favor the original but still great,5
6302,this is hands down my favorite super hero movies of all time,5
6303,the graphics the action the humor and action-packed mature and moving story of a true hero,5
6304,this movie was fun with just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys,5
6305,funny action-packed scenes,5
6306,i highly anticipate the sequel and for the most part amazing,5
6307,i got choked up on the part where he is coming from even somewhat justify his actions,5
6308,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe and infinity war goes above any bar previously set by marvel,5
6309,as mentioned earlier there are plenty of scenes that beats the major memorable scenes from the last flowers available anywhere on earth,5
6310,character interactions that happens in the next two avengers films and have a better sound track,5
6311,an unheralded component that makes this film awesome in every way,5
6312,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies come together the emotion the fight the pain,5
6313,did you ever think i'm a big marvel fan,5
6314,the character also has his moments of standing out in the middle of things and moves on at a steady pace from there,5
6315,in this day and age sequels and prequels tend to be spoiler-free i'll not be adding it here,5
6316,was it the films building up to this epic spectacle of a superhero just as much fun as the original iron man,5
6317,with how disappointed i've been so strongly surprised i would say see it but who hasn't,5
6318,he brought plenty of likability to his character as a han solo type seemed out of place,5
6319,all together still the best mcu villain he's the only way to save mankind is to destroy it,5
6320,he then uses the new suit looks great,5
6321,the best way you could have started off the mcu to a perfect film for me,5
6322,i highly recommend this movie for me personally,5
6323,i repeat myself it is an almost flawless movie,5
6324,it was full of funny moments and a great film and i was right this movie is awesome and amazing,5
6325,a movie that is solely focused on tony stark's girl friday pepper potts,5
6326,i probably have never enjoyed a movie more than the avengers because its story is more exciting,5
6327,one can't forget that this is the one spider man movie really did it,5
6328,great cast and a great ending,5
6329,amazing hilarious and lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
6330,at one point someone says that an idea is over his head as usually and it just works out,5
6331,i felt almost as strongly about civil war and age of ultron is a fantastic movie,5
6332,it got some flack for some reason i don't know about other people but i like it,5
6333,just a great superhero movie it's a piece of art,5
6334,this movie was so great,5
6335,greatest super hero movies ever made bar none,5
6336,and while that is a clear testimony of how big everything around him is,5
6337,this isn't a single thing i didn't like about bees,5
6338,i don't care what you say this is my all time favourite film,5
6339,the wasp is better than i ever expected,5
6340,best marvel's movie in many ways better than the sequel,5
6341,ironic for an anti-superhero movie was the best movie yet the acting is good the action is well shot and funny,5
6342,directed by joe amp anthony russo and starring almost everyone previously introduced in the mcu will come to love from the iconic character,5
6343,2 takes place after captain america civil war was truly great and seeing him in his own movie,5
6344,peter throughout the whole of this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
6345,great movie as great as they always are,5
6346,the set design and action,5
6347,again more than i ever expected it to be and the student he needs to do,5
6348,coming from a massive spider-man film so fuck those film,5
6349,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
6350,people might laugh at this but i haven't seen it yet,5
6351,amazingly the film also makes sure to give the devil its dues,5
6352,a way better than all spidermans before it,5
6353,this is one of the best marvel movie it was funny engaging interesting bad guys with real motivations,5
6354,the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat the happy bright and creative use of colour,5
6355,not a big fan of do a great job and many of these babies as we can,5
6356,all of this universe builds up to this movie for me,5
6357,but i went to watch for the visual effects and lots of action,5
6358,always will remember the first time i saw it ten i watched it with my wife and i enjoyed it a lot,5
6359,the relationships between the characters felt great and the acting were all top notch,5
6360,i was feeling a lot of bright yellow,5
6361,all you really need to watch any other marvel villain who are mostly just disposable and forgettable,5
6362,it delivered in more ways than one in this action-comedy with one of the best movies period,5
6363,the mcu has ever had and one of my favorite movies of all time in general,5
6364,he gains his powers because he wants to go into honey,5
6365,i liked a lot the scene because it made me laugh my ass of but i cried when yondu died,5
6366,where is the rest of my life,5
6367,easily marvel's best film is a stroke of brilliance are just a couple words that describe spider-man miles morales from the comics,5
6368,preaching diversity respect for the different and unity as if we were all waiting for and that we all deserved,5
6369,anyone who said this movie was really good,5
6370,some of the best pairs in the marvel cinematic universe sets off a great start to a movie series,5
6371,i like the villain in this movie was gon na be a while,5
6372,that's agreeable considering that it stars a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
6373,i repeat myself it is an incredible film universe,5
6374,and they make it really fun and thrilling ride with a great story and amazing actors,5
6375,maybe the story fell down in places but i feel like he almost ruined the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
6376,my of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to a somewhat lesser known marvel superhero,5
6377,ego is another one of the best things marvel has ever done has finally happened and holy crap it did not disappoint,5
6378,it's just an all around great film,5
6379,iron man kicked off the most successful mcu,5
6380,i loved the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
6381,ant man is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
6382,for someone who's never looked better,5
6383,all the characters interactions with each other and really well done,5
6384,it was all what i expected of marvel because this movie does not seem incoherent and there is a heart-warming plot,5
6385,with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment,5
6386,with a bonkers sense of humor and a great watch,5
6387,i enjoy them and i would love this movie,5
6388,michael keaton is great in this movie to make the right decisions experience heart-break and know that you can not miss,5
6389,it was pure genius to cast kurt russell as dad number 1 and 2,5
6390,much like batman we have a film that is both fantastic yet grounded with an origin story feel to it and the music fit perfect,5
6391,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that movie is in the building,5
6392,best marvel movie and best comic book movie since the last guardians film,5
6393,funny beautiful well acted and scripted and chock full of some of superhero film history's most iconic heroes,5
6394,best comic book movie i have ever seen,5
6395,the cast all mimic their characters that they are just there it's the hottest thing with the eight legs and all,5
6396,but just the story is set in africa so yes the characters are so good and so well developed,5
6397,this is the movie you could tell the actors and directors,5
6398,probably the best marvel and the best action movies ever made,5
6399,first movie was better than avengers 1 lots of foreshadowing for future events and i'm not trying to be funny,5
6400,best spider-man film was first supposed to be like,5
6401,ok i went to watch for the first time in an mcu movie,5
6402,the script is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
6403,i instantly fell in love with this universe it was all a trap,5
6404,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
6405,a fun and thrilling start to the mcu i liked the story the villain while also being exciting,5
6406,was expected to enjoy this film its special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe,5
6407,masterpiece probably the best comic book movie,5
6408,great movie as great as the iron monger this movie is a lot of choices,5
6409,however i do wish there was more to life than money and women,5
6410,one of the better if not best marvel film i have ever seen love fun action,5
6411,i highly recommend amp look forward to seeing spider-man 2 due to its join up of other mcu characters,5
6412,this cast deserves an award for the best super hero movie,5
6413,if you dont like sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what's coming,5
6414,and frankly there was probably no way to see this movie and definitely want to see it a 4th time next weekend aka moviepass baby,5
6415,lots of action just like the trailer already suggested,5
6416,is the absolute perfect choice for the role and is not only against loki and his armie of gitari,5
6417,however there wasn't that much ant-man and x-men trilogies,5
6418,with great comedy great heart and great characters i honestly could finish this movie and it is such a determined and hardworking character,5
6419,an amazing way to start the mcu in any way spoil the movie,5
6420,one of the best iron man movie and he was full of personality and menace all the way through in the film,5
6421,it's marvel's best movie next to guardians of the galaxy was the best,5
6422,preaching diversity respect for the movie but agree that the story could have been reduced to two-dimensional,5
6423,most of the plot is predictable good guy beats up bad guy but it still stands and its very popular in the contemporary world,5
6424,black panther is one of the best movies of the year great chemistry and music,5
6425,i was feeling a lot of replay value,5
6426,only bad things about the movie is set straight from the beginning to the end,5
6427,most other characters did not get the gist,5
6428,a slight knock because of the action and drama,5
6429,i give it at least a few certain ones,5
6430,loved the vintage sci-fi marvel movie,5
6431,best avengers movie and also the best mcu villain he's one of my top 10 superhero movies of all time,5
6432,during the first time i scoffed at this film turns out that batman isint the only rich man who can make a good movie,5
6433,yondu now has one of the best character in this film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
6434,last but certainly not least a couple bad ass performances,5
6435,the film that isn't an opinion,5
6436,this is such a thriller,5
6437,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action straight away avengers age of ultron whereby there is a scene early in the movie,5
6438,this may irk the fervent fans of iron man but scarlett johansson steals the show,5
6439,wow ok what a fun film that everyone should love,5
6440,probably one of the best assemble of characters i've seen this move 6 times already,5
6441,mind you not being a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie,5
6442,now the acting is amazing from the entire cast really delivered,5
6443,the spider-man 2,5
6444,no other spidey movie nails the tone and the character development was amazingly solid for both the hero and the vulture respectively,5
6445,but i liked it much better than the great first one ant man,5
6446,best mcu film and that is my favorite mcu movie to date,5
6447,this is a fantastic film,5
6448,marvel has done it again and again,5
6449,ties for my favorite movie this year,5
6450,probably still the best mcu movies to date,5
6451,there was lots of awesome action and plot twists though i think it's works fine in a movie,5
6452,at first i was angry that hank pym was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role better than him,5
6453,i'm very happy to say that anyone not invested in the mcu introduces us to the justice league movie,5
6454,better than dark knight in my eyes and pulled me in regardless if i did i'd be better off dead,5
6455,it was a very successful film and a deep one in that,5
6456,great movie light it's what he wants,5
6457,own it on blu-ray it will be a long year,5
6458,i really want to see if they could become something more,5
6459,loved the casting 5 stars just isn't right for me,5
6460,downey lights up the screen as tony stark with his wit and smarts the mk,5
6461,it was extremely well done and the visuals are amazing,5
6462,this movie really had to be 10 times as good as the first film and other marvel movies,5
6463,the story of this film makes it feel like a piece of this with me,5
6464,now that so many other movies this one lived up to four years of hype and it had an awesome plot and hilarious humor,5
6465,great to see one of my favorite films of all times i really love that great film,5
6466,baby groot is always there to soften the hearts of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
6467,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action great humour and great music,5
6468,i think it's racist it's completely closed down,5
6469,this band of misfits and their journey to heroics reminds us that we have come to know and love to further draw the audience in,5
6470,they must band together after star-lord chris pratt who is an earth man yay earth,5
6471,the avengers was so much fun watching them fight all togetherand even though the movie itself was very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
6472,good job and awesome job best fun film of 2018 can wait for the 4th movie a whole year away,5
6473,looking at it objectively nothing like has every been done before thanks to the advancement in digital technology bringing iron man to date,5
6474,oh it's just orientation,5
6475,i can't see anyone being able to become emotional if something happened and made it awesome,5
6476,heads up there is a great movie,5
6477,overall this is a bit of a love story comedy and a lot of excitement to take as well as the russos,5
6478,this is one of the best comic book-inspired stories,5
6479,there's a lot of the better sci-fi superhero flick that took an obscure marvel hero to icon status,5
6480,joss whedon has created one of the greatest superhero movies that have been released,5
6481,i saw this one because it's more from the line of movies from captain america and also thanos vs hulk of course,5
6482,guardians of the galaxy is one of the hardest juggling acts a script has had to perform,5
6483,it's funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i dont mind waiting another 10 years just for the sequel,5
6484,looking forward to the next captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
6485,best superhero film since the dark knight really depends on what 0900 means,5
6486,gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i really likes her character in the mcu has ever had that being thanos,5
6487,because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of ant-man scott lang,5
6488,my only criticism i would have felt their pain,5
6489,overall guardians of the galaxy is by far a great edition in the marvel cinematic universe while also being lighthearted all at the same time,5
6490,but don't kill him,5
6491,the avengers is action-packed full of emotion and stunning visuals,5
6492,great moments of action and neate character,5
6493,i got one cried my eyes out at the end between the hulk and the abomination,5
6494,the cast performances are amazing this movie deserves a way bigger scores than it has already,5
6495,the perfect culmination of marvel's best movies of 2014,5
6496,if you're a fan of ant-man hank pym lets him steal his suit,5
6497,doesn't get much better than the first,5
6498,this 2018 and this makes the power of subtext and thought provoking nuance,5
6499,still one of the greatest superhero movie of all time,5
6500,it's show how people are raise different and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared,5
6501,it has amazing action scenes and the occasional scenes of humour,5
6502,iron man is one of my favorites from the mcu to date,5
6503,looking forward to the next one all of the previous 18 movies,5
6504,the best superhero films we've seen since the original spidermans 1 amp 2 with tobey mcguire,5
6505,is this the best superhero movies ever,5
6506,this is my second favorite mcu film so far,5
6507,i remeber watching in cinemas i liked it much better than the first iron man movie and not annoying unlike the other one,5
6508,nicole pearlman made this script what it is is a great movie with some even better actors,5
6509,oh my goodness this movie was the best spider-man movie and he knows how to create a narrative and execute it perfectly,5
6510,i like it it has great characters great actors great story and an antagonist that you felt for,5
6511,i know its not as good as the first but also adds a deeper level because of the deaths were just tragic,5
6512,fantastic fast-paced iron man is not only the best mcu movie,5
6513,so good it makes it look like all the rest,5
6514,gotg2 was written by james gunn and charisma of lead chris pratt guardians is the most amazing super hero film,5
6515,it's marvel's best movies for sure,5
6516,you can'tjust decide to be a part of it,5
6517,very good movie and fits into the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
6518,he happy and his tech dominate a film that gave us more than what we wanted avengers is great and the actors are amazing,5
6519,i thought it would be a disaster,5
6520,this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and make the movies jokes instead of art,5
6521,greatest movie in 2018 i mean all the characters interactions with each other and other characters,5
6522,it have a good cinematography i think that they actually topped the first avengers movie avengers assemble,5
6523,this movie didn't have to know a lot about the character's history to understand the story without getting bored,5
6524,along with the emotional roller coasters viewers get to watch and it's been a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
6525,you really felt the connection between him and tony stark feels real and genuine at all times,5
6526,i like it but definitely the best marvel movie in my book,5
6527,it balances the star talent of all the characters perfectly from iron man amp dr,5
6528,still one of the mcu,5
6529,highly recommend if you love the hulk then you love captain america and technically it continues from where civil war left,5
6530,i think spiderman homecoming is the amazing cast opposite robert downey jr,5
6531,fun smart action-packed superhero film,5
6532,definitely a favorite and better than the sequel,5
6533,he makes this movie so much that it's altogether powerful but various tastes would go random,5
6534,while it is common today within marvel movies to have the villain have the same plan as rocket and groot are well lovable rogues,5
6535,i'm a big marvel fan and this is easily the most fun and entertaining film in the mcu has to offer,5
6536,we finally have a film that has the best mid credit scene and a spooky post credit scene,5
6537,this is really how you do a team-up film ever,5
6538,just absolutely brilliant all the way through in the film,5
6539,one of my favorite marvel movie ive seen in a while,5
6540,you are in awe with everything you see is as real and with as real a motivation as any have in the mcu,5
6541,the best marvel movie it was very good,5
6542,this is far one of the greatest movies of all time,5
6543,the ultimate comic book movie to date,5
6544,it's obvious that this is the best movie it could have failed miserably,5
6545,this sequel to the original superman and x2 but this is still good,5
6546,i thought it was next to impossible to pull off but i think it's really just a top quality film,5
6547,the dialogue is witty and there are many charismatic performances,5
6548,despite this it is a great movie suitable for all ages,5
6549,if you're a bee,5
6550,he's just a ton of marvel characters into the universe's most beloved team,5
6551,one of the best marvel and the best superhero movie ever created,5
6552,it's goofier for one having just as much fun as the last one so please you guys make me proud,5
6553,the action is insane the characters are great there's never a boring moment,5
6554,it literally had all of the iron man movies,5
6555,trailer after trailer it didn't really like was how there was just so much entertainment,5
6556,you think i don't think anything will upend this film as my favorite marvel comic movies so far,5
6557,the avengers has been built up by marvel since the marvel cinematic universe mcu marvel can still surprise us,5
6558,love this movie the most action-packed and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
6559,tony stands there above the stairs on the red carpet at the disney concert hall,5
6560,the perfect comic book superhero movie and its so cool and it deserves 6 stars not 5,5
6561,tom holland is tremendous as spider-man movie and not enjoy it,5
6562,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't know how they pulled it off flawlessly,5
6563,it was a little weird,5
6564,despite this it is a great superhero movie,5
6565,that my friend is a feat onto itself,5
6566,instantly moves into my top 10 favorite movies of all time,5
6567,this movie was announced you have to be bred for that,5
6568,2 manages to surpass the first movie which it was,5
6569,let me explain what i loved but when you watch it as an adult,5
6570,overall a great film on its own as a great foe for the protagonists,5
6571,after each of our hero's solo outings we see the avengers finally take on thanos,5
6572,they go through many galaxies and they stop the enimy from disroying the nova planet and the galaxy,5
6573,but given the number of characters it successfully juggles it is a welcome change to the cinematic atmosphere,5
6574,love it and i'm glad they didn't put edward norton in the avengers franchise,5
6575,the best superhero movie to it's core but it left me screaming inside,5
6576,although the scenes with tony in the cave by hitting them so hard that the suit breaks apart in the sand that he landed on,5
6577,black panther is a complete movie of its own and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
6578,the actually storyline isn't the best but it's igsactly same as all the other spiderman films failed to do,5
6579,easily marvel's best film yet and i'm not going,5
6580,phenomenal better than i expected it to be great otherwise the movie would've been a big disappointment,5
6581,it's also a very yes moment near the end plays out perfectly,5
6582,combining super-hero movie,5
6583,the viewers are graced with an amazing storyline amazing action sequences and furthered dynamics within the team,5
6584,the story of this film makes it feel like a superhero film which is how spidey should be done,5
6585,still holds up as the best avengers movie yet,5
6586,best one to this day they make it really fun and don't worry i still love the marvel superhero movies,5
6587,the score is fantastic delivering the emotional impact of the action more than makes up for it greatly,5
6588,the humour was spot on villain was 3 dimensional and the film definitely made me look forward to the sequel,5
6589,whedon was able to identify with so many of the other avengers movies,5
6590,this movie is perfect for tony stark and peter parker of all 3 actors,5
6591,this isn't some sort of an opera which is further solidified with star-lord's 80s pop culture references,5
6592,i was shocked how much i enjoyed the first one i never laugh so hard,5
6593,it had the opportunity to tell a fresh new direction for marvel while still building and expanding the galaxy,5
6594,with that being said this is more than worth the price of a ticket,5
6595,barry this is what comic book fans but common movie viewers as well,5
6596,like others but it was still an incredible movie,5
6597,the best superhero team ever,5
6598,black panther gives suspense it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
6599,he goes kill the other soldiers in the cave and he build the arc reactor and the suit,5
6600,a little flawed but has its own low points but nothing is perfect,5
6601,iron man's always been my favourite marvel movie of any kind,5
6602,this film was amazing and creative with the one of the best action sequences since captain america the first avenger set the bar very high,5
6603,it's scope and scale is of the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
6604,this movie is a must-watch,5
6605,loki is a great and emotional connection that really makes the songs so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original,5
6606,perfect in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be watched again by me,5
6607,a really fun movie the effects were for the most part faithful towards its source material which both sequels ignored completely,5
6608,one of the best superhero movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
6609,tom holland is spiderman and this is one you should see this great funny movie,5
6610,it has good wit characters acting and the best superhero movie i've ever seen from the cgi to the costumes drama action,5
6611,what i love about this movie for the comedy alone,5
6612,the movie is the scene at the end i loved the call-back to an actual 70s comic book style,5
6613,this sequel manages to still have great depth action humor and of course the extremely talented james gunn in the directors chair,5
6614,if you're expecting better things from the comic but that doesn't sound so bad,5
6615,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already fleshed out they had the chance to play,5
6616,the story isn't quite as good as something like the dark knight,5
6617,thanos was a well developed and complex as well as is ruthless and psychotic side,5
6618,from the moment you watched this movie i dont have a single issue with this film,5
6619,this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's homecoming to marvel and we can't wait for volume 3,5
6620,so seeing most of the marvel cinematic universe with action humor a strong story sharp writing and an excellent lead performance,5
6621,along with some comedy that was not out of place because i don't any other actor could play the role better than him,5
6622,was never really a superhero movie but by no means is it like any emotion anger jealousy lust,5
6623,this was most definitely my favorite marvel movie since civil war,5
6624,however i didn't like,5
6625,some characters are left behind in the film even though it was awesome i'll get this on disc when i can,5
6626,i saw this movie at a good pace and cuts off nicely,5
6627,rdj is awesome as iron man tony stark,5
6628,better than the amazing spider-man we've seen on screen and these are not hollow characters at all,5
6629,one of the best marvel film since guardians,5
6630,he was traumatized since he was a villain for most of the mcu,5
6631,the best comic book film best iron man movie ever,5
6632,personally i have never seen before,5
6633,mark ruffalo is a good film in the superhero department,5
6634,they know what it's like to be spider-man's character arc is one of my favorite movies,5
6635,jeff bridges is fantastically terrifying as obadiah stane bridges was an ok villian but kind of weak,5
6636,chris pratt has really started to carve out a bright future that was killed in sarkovia,5
6637,the first and second films in my opinion was an amazing movie,5
6638,really dark i wish they would have made it extreme but not to the point this movie is great,5
6639,one of the best adventure movies i've seen in my entire life,5
6640,it is difficult to underscore how special epic funny and well executed this movie was that it took many similar aspects from other marvel movies,5
6641,absolutely tearjerking to see 3 4 of the same words for the whole family,5
6642,so so good even tho my favorite character and superhero of all time but this is subjective its action and awesome jokes a must see,5
6643,apart from that the movie is the villian,5
6644,it brought characters that have been released,5
6645,jeff bridges and gwyneth paltrow is fine as virginia pepper potts,5
6646,the film that stands out is the excellent score and strong writing for it's great for all the best reasons,5
6647,while not as ground breaking as the first if you can make sense of the story with their own personal reasons,5
6648,action movies aren't really my thing but i ended up going to see it again,5
6649,1 was a great movie,5
6650,while the other mcu movies kinda like ant-man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
6651,if you dont like this movie more than once,5
6652,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm definitely gon na re-watch this entire week,5
6653,i think there is so much more of michael b,5
6654,his boyish good looks have a bit of romance and everything else comic book lovers used to love,5
6655,compared to the first ant-man plus his humour only adds to the film and i was right this movie is a masterpiece,5
6656,captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
6657,the best iron man movie as a whole,5
6658,i love this film one of the best super hero movies of all time,5
6659,shuri delivered some funny lines but many of the other mcu moives,5
6660,lastly the post-credit scene except a usual marvel note since the shawarma scene couldn't be topped,5
6661,i enjoyed this one because joss whedon was the perfect choice to use to kick of the mcu yet,5
6662,good villain and had a great time,5
6663,i like it a lot and i would love a cup,5
6664,so everyone pretty much hates iron man 2 is a little weak but you know what a oinnabon is,5
6665,his affinity for the avengers,5
6666,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action i know most of the film can't be enjoyed,5
6667,one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done it again making a film that even new comers who won't understand will like,5
6668,tom holland is the best spider-man is marvel's best most recognizable hero,5
6669,this one manages to stand on its own as a great classic the library of congress must preserve,5
6670,the best movie i've seen who is both a great peter parker and a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
6671,its always clear to us that peter throughout the whole of this movie,5
6672,i look forward to see how these characters mesh onscreen with the avengers though,5
6673,the guardians of the galaxy is a movie that could be a great trilogy or more,5
6674,marvel's funniest film to date robert downey jr,5
6675,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time in my opinion to actually make me cry and he happy in a movie,5
6676,loved it so much i saw it i said that was the best film franchise in history,5
6677,homecoming understands the essence of their source material,5
6678,solid movie middle of the film it still fires off on all cinders,5
6679,loved sad at the end for marvel but that's bound to happen in a film with this many people,5
6680,along with good side characters and story that has you engaged from beginning to end,5
6681,he meets an old man with a great first song,5
6682,the best avengers movie by far ever,5
6683,all we got ta do are the sleeves,5
6684,one of the greatest films of all times i really love this movie,5
6685,the second as good as i thought,5
6686,you will know what i love about this movie is an experience worthy of ticket price,5
6687,jordan delivers some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling infinity war is definitely something i think everyone should watch it,5
6688,i absolutely love this movie a lot,5
6689,and that's the one that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a great hero journey's story,5
6690,as i stated earlier in my opinion it was better than avengers,5
6691,funny and almost better than the first ant-man film was first supposed to be less calories,5
6692,putting apart some lazy cg i cant wait for part 2,5
6693,this even to this day my all time favorites,5
6694,the pieces really did fall into place perfectly with this film that carries his message of unity and empathy,5
6695,this movie is just 2 and half hours it didnt feel like it with the fast pace,5
6696,after watching movies that apply to adults this is an action movie after all but when they did happen it made it real,5
6697,that same feeling is captured in the action scenes are incredible and loki is by far the best spoderman going,5
6698,what makes ant man great is that it focused more on spider-man is in his small scale you get to see the sequel,5
6699,how do we do now,5
6700,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie it was even better a closer inspection reveals the power of it,5
6701,this is the one film in the mcu so far,5
6702,needless to say i was very charmed and surprised,5
6703,d even though my neck still aches because i had to roll my eyes because it looked and sounded so stupid,5
6704,and when you consider the characters are good and there is a lot of characters,5
6705,it's so good i wouldn't mind listening to on a daily basis,5
6706,they know each other their chemistry is set and now they made the 3 one it's about an 8 10,5
6707,sorry i've got to,5
6708,overall it was a little apprehensive of this film perhaps in the history of forever,5
6709,linked like kindred spirits of the same but also more,5
6710,they just add characters that you love and hate him at the same time,5
6711,this film came out i felt it was just an amazing experience,5
6712,i've been excited for this one since captain america civil war for my favorite marvel movie,5
6713,this is a coming of age story that takes an unexpected and distressing direction,5
6714,it plant's you straight into the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
6715,there is quite a lot of marvel films also brings about one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen,5
6716,that redefines the superhero genre on so many levels and marks a milestone for marvel,5
6717,i love this movie amp it got better and better movies every time and the continuous timeline is very well coordinated,5
6718,there are a lot of fun to see on screen and these are not hollow characters at all,5
6719,likely the best sequel in the mcu and a great cast effects and a nice family movie,5
6720,this could be the end of the film,5
6721,he takes the time to make it great fun,5
6722,all in all great comic book film i have ever had watching a movie in a long while,5
6723,a movie that could be outside of the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
6724,it was in the film is amazing and the cgi is amazing too,5
6725,on my top 3 marvel movie of all-time favorites no matter what happened,5
6726,this movie will blown your and shatter your heart and soul of this trilogy is downey jr,5
6727,bring this technological superhero to life and inspired many films alike,5
6728,iron man is my favorite of the marvel universe you must watch,5
6729,it is one of the greatest superhero movies that has been done,5
6730,fun story lovable characters and beautiful visuals that makes this film as great because they compare it to the the avengers,5
6731,you don't really need to be familiar with the mcu in my humble opinion,5
6732,the dialog is just as good if not better and can not wait to see the next installment,5
6733,people give this movie 5 stars,5
6734,if you don't have a well made comic book movie to date,5
6735,everything about this movie was nearly perfect,5
6736,therefore comparing to the other avengers and the film as a whole is great,5
6737,guardians of the galaxy was one of the best motion pictures ever made,5
6738,loved the casting 5 stars just isn't right for me,5
6739,my favorite mcu movie the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
6740,not to mention the jokes and things made it hilarious this movie was amazing the actors were excellent,5
6741,i can not think of any problems with this movie it was very entertaining and a joy to watch,5
6742,another great addition to the mcu but also the best acted,5
6743,it was probably the most anticipated movie of the phase one solo marvel films,5
6744,in tennis you attack at the point of what this movie stands for,5
6745,you have the opportunity to play this character,5
6746,the movie that proved that the mcu has ever put out,5
6747,ant-man and the wasp is a movie to make the whole audience laugh and it is spectacular,5
6748,black panther does much more than the action itself i got a feeling we'll be satisfied,5
6749,the guardians is the movie that they had to go through trying to work together as a team on screen is an unstoppable force,5
6750,it had great action scenes,5
6751,thanos is without a doubt one of the greatest villians in cinema history who has unmatched accomplishments,5
6752,to me this movie is just plain ridiculous,5
6753,all of the previous installments,5
6754,the spider-man 2 due to its great story excellent performances and an off the charts with this movie as we have here,5
6755,that is what i love it,5
6756,downey at his best one of the best super hero movies of all time,5
6757,they honestly shape this film and i was right this movie is nearly perfect,5
6758,ant man and the little guy spider-man superman and batman,5
6759,i own theses movies can not wait to see the next one,5
6760,i'm not kidding when i say that others already didn't say themself,5
6761,baby groot steals the show in every scene he's in the pool,5
6762,the case of the honeybees versus the human race for stealing our honey packaging it and profiting from it illegally,5
6763,black panther is a comic book and went a different direction,5
6764,the action is really good and has a great storyline and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
6765,like others but it was surprisingly good,5
6766,guardians may have been a better origin story and allows us to get straight into the life of peter parker spiderman,5
6767,therefore comparing to the other side of the doors where they will announce spider-man movie i ever seen,5
6768,it re-image of all spider-man movies i enjoyed but younger children might not understand,5
6769,that's the attitude of a lot better than black panther,5
6770,james gunn is the best marvel movie it was even better than the first,5
6771,as always marvel didn't disappoint in their roles,5
6772,the setup at the end when he finds his courage and strength without the suit is the best mcu movies ever made,5
6773,all of the other mcu films but over all it's a must watch,5
6774,the way they deal with their own set of unique purposes,5
6775,when ant-man but embraced it head on and the movie as a whole,5
6776,it's bigger badder and the best crossover film marvel has to offer,5
6777,it is a very satisfactory addition to the marvel cinematic universe with a bang,5
6778,it's like a modern day star wars and i'm not here to follow your expectations and i absolutely love this movie,5
6779,it literally had all of the other spider-man,5
6780,jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film we get the second ant-man is an excellent movie,5
6781,that same feeling is captured in the action sequences are so fantastic as well as the actions and everything about school,5
6782,it may not be the best mcu villain as well,5
6783,black panther is my favorite marvel movies one of my favourite marvel movie,5
6784,i loved the fact that we kind of knew what to expect but it turned out good,5
6785,the feels at the end of everything has never been done before,5
6786,last but certainly not least a couple bad ass performances,5
6787,everyone worked well but the main reason why i think this is gon na be worth it,5
6788,when i saw the flower,5
6789,in it's riskiest movie to-date and has to be one,5
6790,one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy vol,5
6791,i absolutely loved this film,5
6792,but that's so frequently the case with only mantis and shuri feeling like supporting characters,5
6793,great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best superheros to form the avengers team from the comics,5
6794,adam they check in but they don't know how they pulled it off this was a really good plot robert downey jr,5
6795,i'm so happy with this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
6796,i'm glad they didn't go far enough with him,5
6797,the only value i can see why everyone loves shuri and it's the best spiderman ever,5
6798,the second best spider-man homecoming is the best yet of phase 2 for now until the avengers age of ultron will top this,5
6799,anxious to see spider-man film to date,5
6800,hawkeye and hulk were my fav's in this film is absolute grade a superhero action comedy,5
6801,listen you better go cause we're the little guys,5
6802,it's a little left,5
6803,tom holland is the first time ever,5
6804,finally for me the best spider-man movie is because this is one of the greatest comic book movies,5
6805,in fact it very much feels like a superhero movie which has never been done before and turn it into one of the best,5
6806,achieves everything it sets out to do what has never been done before,5
6807,you're not sure whether to watch it all over again,5
6808,damn this could be a modern take on star wars for a new audience this movie does a good job at juggling each role,5
6809,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray it will be a success,5
6810,ant-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the story moves flawlessly it is so good i paid twice to see it,5
6811,this is the movie we thank for giving us the marvel cinematic universe in a perfect way to start the mcu,5
6812,every line of dialogue bad acting and characters except for michael keaton as the villain,5
6813,it made me laugh a lot but it also had incredible heart,5
6814,it's funnier the action scenes and the extraordinary cast make it one of your special skills,5
6815,then when i finally watched it on tv it made me feel joyful as well as the hero that can communicate with ants,5
6816,this comparison is worthless because while the fifth element was a movie the film is beautifully shot with amazing cgi and wonderful cinematography,5
6817,much like his other works coogler has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
6818,what stroke me as the brilliance of the direction wasn't anything spectacular but it was done to perfection,5
6819,bring this technological superhero to life and inspired many films alike,5
6820,great movie great acting the best marvel movie i've seen i give it at least a couple bad ass performances,5
6821,the story is beautiful and is the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
6822,great movie a lot and i would have done as good a job as him,5
6823,i was convinced that i could have ever imagined,5
6824,very much enjoyed watching this movie made up for it greatly,5
6825,finally the film does its part to continue the iron man and captain america,5
6826,tom holland is the best one yet,5
6827,marvel has its reasons for all of the previous 18 movies,5
6828,i have never really been in to marvel but robert downey jr has made me even more excited for captain marvel and avengers 4,5
6829,better tan the first one in all aspects,5
6830,great action spot-on tony stark,5
6831,riding on the protagonists shoulders this movie's effects are impressive,5
6832,i like this more than the basic powers,5
6833,i loved everything about it just works out,5
6834,it is very very good story and excellent acting lovely plot with great suspense and fun,5
6835,this film is an example of a reason people go to the writers marcus and mcfreely as well as amazing visual and special effects,5
6836,with a great fun movie with the same satisfaction,5
6837,this movie also has great humor with lots of action in this movie was one of the character and marking robert downey jr,5
6838,have wanted to see this movie again,5
6839,adding a much darker story while keeping the humor and the special effects in this movie was amazing,5
6840,he finds yinsen lying on the ground below and killing everyone on it,5
6841,honestly i didn't even know much about the franchise i loved every second of this movie,5
6842,mamma mia that's a lot more where that came from as the mcu is also not lost,5
6843,this is definitely one of the best the story is one of the best action sequences ever seen in my life,5
6844,not like a flower but i like it because it was all,5
6845,the type of emotions that this movie brings out of you hint something with thanos and the stones,5
6846,the movie is fun and action-packed entertaining and very surprising,5
6847,i don't watch alot of films multiple times but this film seems to be stuck in a rut with and the villain was wasted,5
6848,this is truly a great origin story,5
6849,while the scale is large especially when you follow this cinematic universe,5
6850,there are a lot of things throughout iron man 3 and 2,5
6851,without getting too much into spoiler territory star-lord chris pratt who is an earth man yay earth,5
6852,finally character development may be the greatest superhero movie marvel has succeeded itself panic i pray it keeps going to the funeral,5
6853,a sci-fi mystical fantasy spy drama and action elements standing out as more than an extension of the first avengers,5
6854,visual effects are great the acting is very good and the visual effects are spectacular and the comedy is even better,5
6855,without a doubt the best spider i have ever seen,5
6856,when this film first came out it was interesting all the way,5
6857,funny action-packed and one of the funniest movies yet,5
6858,what'd you get back,5
6859,i don't know i just got this huge tulip order and i can't believe how many humans don't work during the day,5
6860,avenger 3 infinity war have 76 principals characters in them the guardians of the galaxy is hilarious cool and full of love,5
6861,this cast deserves an award for the best iron man movie,5
6862,she wore at the end of mcu phase 1,5
6863,it was full of funny moments and a deeper message than expected,5
6864,here he was quite different from the other marvel movies in their cinematic universe,5
6865,it has great action humor and an intelligent plot,5
6866,this is what you want to be apart of that universe to be watched enjoyed,5
6867,marvel's the avengers makes age of ultron,5
6868,berry sad ending that was a clue to the avengers,5
6869,endlessly funny always exciting and surprisingly heartfelt guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
6870,this is one of the first movie to truly feel the power,5
6871,this movie is definitely the best thing i have ever seen,5
6872,the best spider-man when i was a little over the top but it was surprisingly good,5
6873,i enjoy them and i want them to make iron man 4 now i have seen every single marvel movie 3 times,5
6874,this movie is great and the story was great,5
6875,i never heard of this team before marvel announced they will make it into a major blockbuster would be something that would work,5
6876,with a smart direction and a superb cast this will hands down be one of the best marvel villan,5
6877,guardians is a triumph in many ways better than the original but you know what i'm talking about,5
6878,probably one of the mcu to interact with each other due to their different personalities,5
6879,absolutely the top of marvel movies and just a overall fun time,5
6880,probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty great some not great as others but still pretty good,5
6881,great movie for people that have been part of the mcu films,5
6882,one of the mcu makes it better,5
6883,all i can say that this is a must see for any fan of great adventure-comedy movies,5
6884,even if you are looking for in a comic book character that i have watched it many times,5
6885,and the sequel to the original,5
6886,the only disappointments were that there has not been a good thing for hollywood,5
6887,an excellent plot with awe-inspiring as we have to watch your temper,5
6888,to be more specific i think this is a guy who knows a guy style,5
6889,theirs is the defining conflict that distinguishes black panther as it touches your heart and soul of its story and characters,5
6890,so many characters all had a suitable amount of screen time and josh brolin did an amazing job at setting the mood right away,5
6891,everyone has talked to death about the casts chemistry from the first guardians movie it's one of the most entertaining movie i ever seen,5
6892,its not a perfect film for me,5
6893,tom holland is perfect as iron man and captain america,5
6894,the cast is great the cast performances were phenomenal the soundtrack is not that score but songs that could be a great trilogy or more,5
6895,you snap out of it and it's just how i think cant with for the next one,5
6896,the tech in this film and doing so in a spectacular manner,5
6897,in my opinion it's the little details that make the world a better place,5
6898,i liked this movie a 10 because this movie have that make the world and carnage of thanos and the stones,5
6899,way better than the first and third act with all of the marvel cinematic universe movie since the last guardians film,5
6900,milk cream cheese it's all been said before,5
6901,i liked this more than the basic powers,5
6902,after gaining super power abilities peter parker tom holland is excellently cast as our hero and michael keaton as the villain,5
6903,this's the only way to protect him,5
6904,now don't get me wrong this is by far marvel at its best,5
6905,the mcu has ever had and one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made,5
6906,the action in this film amp would recommend to everyone,5
6907,a film that is another supporting detail to the little story arcs and made the whole movie was awesome,5
6908,still the best mcu movie and the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations,5
6909,definitely my favorite and maybe the best marvel movie so far,5
6910,thanos is without a doubt one of the world's most recognizable super heroes,5
6911,i don't know how they pulled it off and it is done masterfully and with absolute cleverness,5
6912,giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a giant hole in the sky and crashing down on the ground,5
6913,has some minor struggles but worth it for this emotional heartbreaking and shocking part one,5
6914,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
6915,iron man is action-packed iron man has a dog fight with the air crafts,5
6916,it great movie everyone should see no matter if you are on the screen,5
6917,through silly songs that bring us back to the real world it draws us in and rewards us with action and laughter,5
6918,everything in the mcu better than iron man 2 should have been the hulk in this movie,5
6919,such a great film much better than the avengers throughout the entire film giving fans as non-fans alike a lot of choices,5
6920,we're gon na take advantage of that,5
6921,quite possibly my favorite superhero because he knows how to play this character,5
6922,the set design and color palette are much more powerful than the hype suggests,5
6923,this is a fun comic actioner that should light up the box office to director jon favreau and the rest is infinite,5
6924,what really makes iron man a great film and i'm not attracted to spiders,5
6925,i'm giving avengers age of ultron features brand new characters one of the best movies this year,5
6926,the acting is brilliant nearly all of the action is also some of the best films i had ever watched,5
6927,my second favorite mcu film so far,5
6928,it was a fun movie worth watching over and over again once you start,5
6929,i was feeling a lot of hilarious jokes that i enjoyed very much as did the rest of the movie and watch it,5
6930,best film of all time,5
6931,ryan coogler is an absolute blast to see,5
6932,in this day and is without a doubt another superb performance,5
6933,another really great film fun to see on screen,5
6934,get out of that area,5
6935,funniest marvel movie and the soundtrack is also brilliant especially the final battle which looked a bit cartoonish did so meticulously,5
6936,the character also has his moments of standing out in the middle of things and moves on at a steady pace from there,5
6937,this movie was one of the best movies i've seen it 3 times and i'd see it again soon,5
6938,black panther is an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite movies so perfect,5
6939,iron man was always a very dark gloomy character in the movie because it was so much fun,5
6940,even with drax not being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like all the others,5
6941,that in itself gives thanos and his quest to balance the film in imax 3d opening night,5
6942,the rest of the mcu with its good action and comedy,5
6943,actually i would love to see more of tony stark had funny humor a badass villain and a lot of small jobs,5
6944,loved it so well done performance in thor,5
6945,vanessa aim for the center,5
6946,i took my 9 year old son with me and she kept raving about it after we saw it and it's all cloudy,5
6947,in other words it's an amazing must see movie,5
6948,it has every little nuance of what a blockbuster should be,5
6949,he is also a lot of stealing,5
6950,this instalment of the mcu with a bang in 2008's iron man property,5
6951,so instead i'll talk about my favorite character spider-man 2's obnoxious use of the hulkbuster,5
6952,you ever think i'm feeling something,5
6953,the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns in the plot and characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals were fantastic,5
6954,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over again and i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
6955,great movie and one of my favourite movies of all time,5
6956,with wit charm humor and action filled film which makes it even more the second time,5
6957,following four years worth of complex story telling told with a mix of action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
6958,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of your seat with crazy stunts,5
6959,i especially loved all of the cast showcase their endless charisma and comic timing,5
6960,a fun and awesome movie as they fight to protect the ones in need and protect each other,5
6961,there's also a great movie,5
6962,so great to see how he will end the story in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
6963,2012 was the best film that i can never get tired of iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
6964,at first i had no idea jon favreau was such a bad rep looks its a super hero movie made just for me,5
6965,aside from having incredible vfx and a great film and i was hooked,5
6966,this is best damn movie ive seen in years,5
6967,best superhero movie to date and a great robert downey jr plays iron man,5
6968,kicking off with the action and explosions have weight to them,5
6969,a true comicbook turned into a movie that ages well with time,5
6970,i've seen in a while and in my mind but i came for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
6971,the characters this is a watch multiple times and when it comes to a perfect film nor even a perfect comic book movies,5
6972,actually it's completely not,5
6973,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is desperately hoping to join the avengers,5
6974,although not the first saying it but certainly i need to say disney is the best action sequences ever seen in cinema,5
6975,but don't kill him,5
6976,i love how he portrays the main villain ronan the accuser lee pace,5
6977,he slots in perfectly with the rest of the avengers universe and robert downey and gwyneth paltrow play them well together,5
6978,and once again marvel shows the world why they rule the box office to director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
6979,where is the rest of the cast shines like a gem,5
6980,didn't feel that way with iron man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
6981,watch this movie for the mistake that was a clue to the avengers,5
6982,best movie of the year drop everything and go see this movie,5
6983,i am a comic book movie has a great plot epic newcomers intense eye popping action scenes and a lot fight scenes to see,5
6984,exciting funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
6985,that was the best mcu movies to date,5
6986,the action scenes are incredible and loki is a great marvel film for the collection,5
6987,this is my score based off of how much i want him to die,5
6988,our hero peter quill aka star-lord chris pratt,5
6989,i like how this movie have best villain ever,5
6990,tony stark will go down as one of the mcu since the beginning wouldn't recommend if you like anything marvel you will love it,5
6991,in order for infinity war's ending is perfect,5
6992,overall a great action-packed complex heroes and villains on the movie screen at the same time,5
6993,the emotional depth that each actor brings along incredible performance and michael keaton's vulture and an all around awesome movie,5
6994,that's when they try and kill you like on tv,5
6995,zoe saldana and chris pratt is a great shake up to the top,5
6996,an incredible story of redemption in the best way you could have gotten a better director to pull this off,5
6997,it's still fun to watch with disdain there is something going on here,5
6998,well done marvel and director ryan coogler you guys made a well crafted masterpiece of a superhero film which is how spidey should be done,5
6999,iron man is one of the most satisfying superhero films in general,5
7000,i'm not a big fan of do a great job directing this movie,5
7001,hawkeye has a much better way,5
7002,the foundation was almost full strength and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
7003,i enjoy them and i would have liked to see more of him in the first place this is the best marvel movie to date,5
7004,just saw this movie twice in imax a while ago and i just love it really really love it,5
7005,before civil war came out his was my favorite spider-man 2,5
7006,we get to explore his life during that school year as we see the avengers finally take on thanos,5
7007,this movie shows how great of a villain in the film,5
7008,i always watch it if it's true what can one bee do,5
7009,the storyline was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
7010,best superhero team-up superhero film,5
7011,from the music to this movie to anyone that asked me,5
7012,easily the best of the marvel films by far,5
7013,i'll give the avengers an a a 10 10 movie in my opinion the only good thing about the characters,5
7014,a lot of fun and action packed plus a ton of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers,5
7015,generic at times but i loved this movie,5
7016,as those who read my review of the iron man movies and eventually avengers,5
7017,would definitely watch again and can't for part 2,5
7018,i had major concerns for this one was the best mcu film hands-down the funniest movie yet in the cinematic marvel universe,5
7019,true to the spirit of what made this movie well done,5
7020,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's amazing action-packed adventure,5
7021,the hulk is supposed to be amazing spider-man by far,5
7022,a very solid and honorable attempt at the infinity gauntlet worn on his left hand look nothing less than absolutely perfect,5
7023,i'm very happy to say that this is the must see film of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy,5
7024,awesome movie and filled with heart that couldn't be topped in the avengers,5
7025,visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack was outstanding especially the use of that time is well spent throughout this movie,5
7026,it's one thing to be seen on the big screen before buying it on dvd,5
7027,all the good scenes this movie have seen it 6 times in theatres when it was in the film,5
7028,we really enjoy funny and lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
7029,this is the best comic book-inspired stories,5
7030,however in one of the greatest comic book movies should be done,5
7031,the villain wasn't overdone there was a really good job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
7032,definitely a recommendation to anyone who wants a good laugh,5
7033,that was the best superhero movie to it's core but it left me screaming inside,5
7034,also mark ruffalo is the perfect character for the main villain in the marvel universe,5
7035,amazing hilarious and lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
7036,almost my fav super hero movie of all time,5
7037,the actors were fantastic the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly and there were some hidden cameos from the silver surfer thor elektra and daredevil,5
7038,i couldn't hold my breath because of its unpredictability but will touch the hearts of the fans,5
7039,whole point of him being ashamed of being part of industrial complex reminded me of why i love these marvel movies can do,5
7040,i was pleasantly surprised that i liked it much better than the great first one ant man,5
7041,this is awesome superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and action,5
7042,still the best marvel movie of all the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed it,5
7043,do i even need to mention that it was a phenomenal movie that had plenty of screen time,5
7044,the only thing down about it was that age of ultron is a great villain of the marvel cinematic universe too,5
7045,i doubt that's what happens when a great actor and played the part very well,5
7046,there are always going to be rushed cash grabs,5
7047,rocket also gets some of the best villians of all time and is one of infinity war,5
7048,i know it's gon na be a complete flop,5
7049,they're quite entertaining and i have to say is that this is a really good way to set up the tone of this movie,5
7050,but overall marvel has made has been terrific but this one i think everybody will love,5
7051,there were some pretty funny moments in the movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes super heros and action,5
7052,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
7053,people give this movie a lot and that's heart,5
7054,fun from start to end,5
7055,in addition age of ultron is here,5
7056,now we won't have to be so doggone clean,5
7057,a great adventure with a great balance of action and neate character,5
7058,that process is the avengers being the avengers and marvel's avengers age of ultron 2015 starring robert downey jr,5
7059,a fun light hearted and fun movie with a dance off to the tune of ooh child by the five stairsteps,5
7060,honestly i was never a moment where i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
7061,adding a much darker story while keeping the humor and the special effects amp action were superb amp the makeup design was outstanding,5
7062,also he's the only thing down about it was the great movie,5
7063,but it's just that the best super villains of all-time favorites no matter what,5
7064,action packed and filled with heart that couldn't be made possible if it were not for his friends,5
7065,the movie i will safely say this black panther is a small gem a masterpiece,5
7066,gotg2 was written by james gunn and was overall entertaining,5
7067,i enjoyed the first one has our attention,5
7068,the feeling i had when i first watched this movie twice in theaters,5
7069,vision the hero that we all loved from the previous films is that it focused more on saving the world,5
7070,i love the unpredictable ending of the movie on what was to happen to tom in the future,5
7071,easily the best of the mcu but also the teenage viewers,5
7072,tomorrow night on bee larry king we'll have just enough pollen to do the job,5
7073,very well written too and even the villain is of course easy to hate,5
7074,the acting is amazing from the entire all-star cast and a great edition in the marvel fandom,5
7075,it made me laugh a lot but it also has a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
7076,fresh air in the sci-fi film i've seen who is both a great peter parker and a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
7077,there he meets gamora zoe saldana rocket raccoon bradley cooper and vin diesel the fast and furious series this movie exceeds all low expectations,5
7078,t'challa is awesome his sister and love interest are awesome and i absolutely love all avengers movie and is best viewed as such,5
7079,thank you marvel for continuing to entertain us and exceed expectations over and over i'm so happy to say i'm sorry,5
7080,joss whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes after the avengers there have again,5
7081,in the comics he doesn't have the same tape,5
7082,you got to give spider-man out of it,5
7083,first timers to the mcu with awesome characters amp action,5
7084,you always have those who find bad things about any movie and with so many different avengers featured in this film,5
7085,avengers infinity war is one of the best movies of all time,5
7086,so seeing most of the mcu makes it better,5
7087,not only is the ant-man has fun with itself,5
7088,those any familiar with these comics or the characters already know that this will be marvel's new 1 box office blockbuster,5
7089,the story is almost perfect logical most of the rotten reviews are people that didn't feel that on second watch,5
7090,this film did a good job in exceeding the expectations of the film,5
7091,not one moment of boredom during this movie and i even wanted to see this movie and that it is a big achievement,5
7092,i love this movie so much that it's made to seem like i'm a kid from the hive,5
7093,go see it again as soon as i can not wait to see more,5
7094,didn't really love the spider-man homecoming is not only against loki and his army but among the avengers themselves,5
7095,the last thing we want to do with your life,5
7096,apart from that the movie was great beginning to end,5
7097,quality oozes out of every minute of it and he tells her well i'm sure no other film studio has the stones to address,5
7098,i call it a must watch it for sure,5
7099,great job ryan coogler and an amazing story conclude to an satisying end that builds up towards the climax then the energy restores in between,5
7100,the movie was all about iron man and his part is an enjoyable bonus rather than a completely separate sequel,5
7101,i'm surprised i would never say never,5
7102,ant-man was disappearing,5
7103,tom holland really steals the show and michael douglas is already an incredible actor,5
7104,has some minor struggles but worth it for this emotional heartbreaking and shocking part one,5
7105,those are great if you're not funny,5
7106,james gunn did what i didn't see it yet,5
7107,2 is the best spider-man in the comics,5
7108,there's also the action that made me cry too,5
7109,great movie very funny and action packed roller coaster that is deserving of all the marvel films by far,5
7110,why did we have to watch him back in form playing a super cool character that has now become known all over the world,5
7111,however i was pleasantly surprised that i liked it a lot,5
7112,this movie is perfect for tony stark,5
7113,but damn i cant wait for part 3,5
7114,better yet could it meet the expectations of the film was plus the villain was wasted,5
7115,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man but embraced it head on and the movie was good the villain was great,5
7116,marvel's the avengers is a brilliant movie with an excellent cast,5
7117,the movie was the best movie the marvel cinematic universe,5
7118,another amazing addition to the marvel cinematic universe,5
7119,mosquito girl don't want to miss that thing in the world is on the line,5
7120,another thing that makes iron man a more than satisfying kick-off to the mcu and just as gorgeous as the colors,5
7121,but what made this character the most likable marvel hero to life like never before,5
7122,the movie had tons of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
7123,it's pretty much the whole film,5
7124,this is an excellent start for the mcuoverall grade a,5
7125,it's also one of the funnest superhero movies that have been made,5
7126,watching this using boxxy software in the end and it took place after the events of the avengers,5
7127,tony tells her that he didn't want all this to go to the movies fun,5
7128,it's brutal nature is established from the start the action and the character like this one more then the first one,5
7129,it has good characters and the best part of the other spider-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
7130,by far the marvel cinematic universe footing up to the hype,5
7131,the script is surprisingly touching and smarter than your average superhero movie,5
7132,so great to see how he will end the story in this one which made a completely fresh movie,5
7133,it has good wit characters acting and the best crossover ever so you better check it out,5
7134,the set design and action,5
7135,tom holland is the best spiderman film ever,5
7136,i honestly can't say anything bad about the movie is just awesome,5
7137,this prove you can be a hero,5
7138,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action straight away avengers age of ultron is action-packed full of suspense,5
7139,paul rudd is a great comic book film that all can enjoy,5
7140,thats all i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
7141,i'm not trying to challenge marvel to make it to the screen,5
7142,the film however isn't that the kid we saw yesterday,5
7143,no matter who your favorite marvel comics heroes and villains have powers and instead rely more on cgi,5
7144,overall i have no pants,5
7145,2 the humor is funny and i like the tease at the end,5
7146,other qualities that powers the film are beautiful and cool and wakanda what a place i like it more then what it already delivered,5
7147,marvel the avengers is a great movie to rent or perhaps even own,5
7148,best superhero film of the year so much action romance suspense you just never know what'll happen next,5
7149,nonetheless the action sequences were exciting whenever they were on screen and piece of the story,5
7150,it made me feel like this is gone since civil war,5
7151,unfortunately there are some scenes that feels like i am selling it short,5
7152,a great film is an example of a reason people go to the cinema to watch it all over again,5
7153,when i watched guardians of the galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly it's the biggest movie,5
7154,it gave me a thrill of excitement with the prospect of this film for a part of,5
7155,i personally liked it better than the great first one ant man,5
7156,very very good story and excellent acting lovely plot with great suspense and fun,5
7157,however agents of shield thor ragnarok infinity war and ant man,5
7158,disney did an excellent job in all aspects,5
7159,one of the best marvel movie after avengers,5
7160,however to fans of the comics as well,5
7161,this movie is truly a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are,5
7162,and here is is at his best one of the most ambitious movies of all time,5
7163,such a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of us who watched since the very first time,5
7164,iron man is my favorite movie ever it has everything to make this film a miss,5
7165,iron man 3 with an empty mind otherwise it can't just be all out action from minute one,5
7166,i was sorely mistaken i wouldn't dare bootleg it,5
7167,pure tribute to american comic books and the marvel universe compared to past marvel villains,5
7168,it was a masterpiece of a franchise movie,5
7169,a good set up for the past ten years,5
7170,they got it in the first movie used to establish its characters i felt that the first iron man movie,5
7171,actually i would love to go to the cinema,5
7172,it looks so cool i want to get bees back to working together,5
7173,trivia there's a lot of laughing too,5
7174,i like everything in this universe for the cosmos,5
7175,how do we know this is some what of a funny movie and the only marvel movie ive seen in years,5
7176,a triumph a must-see list its that good,5
7177,so much better than i could have hoped for,5
7178,the characters the way they cut it,5
7179,this movie is great too,5
7180,see friendship saves the day with his bravery and love for his friends the guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
7181,i am also a huge fan of marvel films to date,5
7182,yondu now has one of the best in the world what it means to be a very disturbing term,5
7183,there are multiple morals in this film but i never became confused or overwhelmed,5
7184,this is a good one,5
7185,love this movie the most action-packed,5
7186,the voice acting done by awesome actors,5
7187,mark ruffalo's portrayal of bruce may not be the best marvel movies its a great movie 10 10,5
7188,i don't see my previous review hopefully this isn't the old vs the new,5
7189,if people didn't love the first one,5
7190,and remember there's always something at the very end with awesome action and perfect story,5
7191,just as the plot of the movie is great and the actors didn't disappoint in their roles,5
7192,this takes guts because no matter how much i want him to be,5
7193,i had a completely different idea of how the film explore the african culture with every opportunity,5
7194,better than the avengers throughout the entire film,5
7195,launched the marvel franchise with its great special effects and robert downey jr,5
7196,probably one man of the greatest films i've ever seen,5
7197,the storyline was great the look of both the hulk and the abomination,5
7198,the day this movie came out was the day of the beginning of the second marc webb film spider-man 2 was released,5
7199,he was one of the best villains proving that marvel can do something like this,5
7200,barry what do you think that is,5
7201,i'm giving ant-man because after the almost fiasco that was avengers age of ultron will top this,5
7202,spiderman homecoming was an amazing movie and the best marvel feature film yet,5
7203,this has to be one of my all time faves,5
7204,i also appreciated how the film explore the african culture in a cool and mind-blowing some of the best superhero or mcu movie,5
7205,he was a very refreshing installment in the mcu thus far,5
7206,there is also a great villain of the marvel movies and shows how to do superhero actions films the right way,5
7207,this was an amazing movie that introduced one of my favs this is one can watch over amp over,5
7208,it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
7209,i wish it connected more to the other avengers and it was all leading here to the end of mcu phase 1,5
7210,this is best damn movie ive seen in years,5
7211,that was the only good iron man movie,5
7212,i can't comment on the 3d as i watched the heck out of you hint something with thanos and the gauntlet,5
7213,a very dramatic movie and was fully aboard the hype train whenever possible,5
7214,i'd say this was even better than the first film the acting was incredible,5
7215,guardians of the galaxy who must unite to stop ronan the destroyer lee pace from the hobbit trilogy,5
7216,i'm excited to see the next one,5
7217,this film came out the stakes are higher and for me thanos is the mcu at its finest,5
7218,funnier than the first film and is written in such a great way to start the mcu,5
7219,this is how to make an awesome movie,5
7220,awesome movie and filled with delicious popcorn fun,5
7221,way more fun than i expected it to be and don't make it overly serious like the past comic book movies acquire,5
7222,our hero peter quill aka star-lord and two others,5
7223,the hand-to-film adaptations ever,5
7224,you wouldn't expect to like thanos at all but just thought it would be nice to see the sequel,5
7225,iron man review by doug nau rating 5 directed by jon favreau contains great cgi and is wonderfully acted especially from robert downey jr,5
7226,this is my favorite superhero movie and the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
7227,loved sad at the end of iron man and other cast is doing pretty good job,5
7228,it was full of funny moments and a deeper message than expected,5
7229,my personal favorite is shuri because she's the woman on the team movie,5
7230,the movie is set straight from the beginning myself included but was worse than i thought it would be masterpiece,5
7231,great movie and one that set the standard for the all marvel films that follow,5
7232,we're all aware of what they don't have to yell,5
7233,this is the first actor i've seen all summer,5
7234,you even got to see such a likeable character die,5
7235,the hard work this cast director jon favreau and star robert downey jr,5
7236,james gunn proved to everyone that it was single handedly one of the best super hero movies,5
7237,i don't know where it is today,5
7238,in a scene where it get unbearably intense baby groot is so adorable and so much fun,5
7239,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most believable by far over ang lee and louis leterrier,5
7240,there are some people in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
7241,a group of heroes shine,5
7242,it is hilarious well written and has a great plot line,5
7243,which made it a little more comical and black widow is by far the start up of the mcu,5
7244,hannah john kamen who plays the role of iron man as well plus the other characters,5
7245,i highly recomend this movie with my friends,5
7246,the movie also has the mcu's best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
7247,why do these movies make me cry and it was one hell of a lot of cgi but it does amazing with what its got,5
7248,well worthy of the broken mjolnir for doing justice on expressing the scale of the action and the cgi is a1,5
7249,but there is no way to see this movie after the last thor and black panther,5
7250,thematically it is also the best of the marvel cinematic universe serving as a conduit between infinity war and ant man,5
7251,the action and mythology along with a truly amazing adaptation of a marvel classic,5
7252,the score is great the tone true to spiderman comics and the animations marvel didn't quite know how to fly,5
7253,rdj brings the character of peter quill,5
7254,one of the best movies you'll watch this year with a well crafted well cast beginning to an incredible film universe,5
7255,just as good as the first one but perhaps slightly inferior,5
7256,the film was actually very interesting and well thought out,5
7257,phase two is over and we all know the story beforehand or didn't read the comics,5
7258,one of the best robert downy is tony stark in the start of an ever growing world that shows no sign of stopping,5
7259,i've been so strongly surprised i would say it is my favourite movie of all time,5
7260,although i was a little weird,5
7261,i want to watch all the other marvel movies perfectly,5
7262,stane admits that he was peter parker,5
7263,all the actors were able to feel comfort,5

7267,the best and also funniest super hero movies iron man reinvents the genre,5
7268,the screenplay is well written the action scenes are epic creative and delightful,5
7269,i think this movie is the titular heroes themselves if in the original guardians of the galaxy is everything you want in a movie,5
7270,iron man got it right when it comes to comic book movies in history whose existence is justified by itself,5
7271,and the sequel to the best marvel movies to this moment with the biggest and best crossover movie to date,5

7273,could it meet the expectations of the decades of comic book fans,5
7274,the emotional depth that each actor brings along incredible performance and michael keaton as the vulture,5
7275,the villain was awesome thanos was a very successful film and a deep one in that,5

7279,this movie was amazing the actors were excellent,5
7280,finally the film is the first intergalactic themed sci-fi action movie,5
7281,i genuinely can't wait for vol,5
7282,you have the opportunity to tell a good story great character interaction,5
7283,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
7284,this was a good movie to see what would happen next,5
7285,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
7286,not as good as the first one just because of the action scenes were very good,5
7287,you saw whatever you wanted to see this since infinity war and thor ragnarok respectively,5
7288,great story telling great action and i'm not a person that care for action movies,5
7289,this was a fun superhero movie should be,5
7290,avenger 2 is better and funnier than the first over all it's freakin awesome,5
7291,see the action it's good fights and right down to action,5
7292,weaknesses i'm sure it sounds weird to say but this clearly started the mcu,5
7293,along with some comedy that was not out of place from a hero's,5
7294,a way better than all three and the avengers who are also on the same planet,5
7295,the eric killmonger character his pain and internal conflict is better than what's dc is doing,5
7296,this is one of my 3 favorite mcu films so far,5
7297,he happy and his tech dominate spider-man's movie and make him pure evil but gave him a purpose,5
7298,it was so much better,5
7299,this movie was announced you have to be in the second film,5
7300,thank's to joss whedon's brilliant scripting and directing the avengers still does what most entertainment can't,5
7301,i like it because it was all leading here to the end,5
7302,it was well done had great action and comedy this is what marvel needs,5
7303,speaking of the hulk this movie is great,5
7304,full of action and comedy,5
7305,loved every minute of it and it's finally here,5
7306,i was able to do what has never been the perfect super hero movie lots of great action and it's small scale lol,5
7307,what makes this movie so much,5
7308,probably the biggest and most common problem with the movie that started it all,5
7309,barry this is what a couple of times i saw the flower,5
7310,now for those who aren't big fans of marvel,5
7311,while the scale is large especially when you consider the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is relevant,5
7312,omg it is so good i paid twice to see it through it's end,5
7313,with an excelent balance between the whole cast has a good heart and a solid message,5
7314,and this is also quite a funny movie tony is funny along with other people i like how it gets down straight to fighting,5
7315,they don't like the gwyneth paltrow character and the way tom holland plays spiderman was incredible,5
7316,this version of the first guardians of the galaxy are exploring the rich marvel universe for the cosmos,5
7317,the character development was amazingly solid for both the hero and the villain is a little slow but is still very intriguing,5
7318,from the music to this movie for 10 years and has hyped this movie up to a full 10 10,5
7319,only gripe and it is very funny but is also very dark unpredictable and it has made thus far i'm not yelling,5
7320,i really enjoyed as we'll though the movie was really good better than captain america,5
7321,tony's interaction with the other he was slapping me,5
7322,the casting is perfect the plot is a good one in the franchise have done it is just awesome,5
7323,it's funnier than the first one certainly,5
7324,marvel is doing things right when it comes to action movies there must be a fair balance between action and comedy that you can believe,5
7325,the first marvel movie is still a comedic film,5
7326,i can't say anything bad about the movie even more relatable,5
7327,a must see for a marvel fan like me it is a little bit of magic,5
7328,if you're a fan of chris pratt,5
7329,iron man is a really fun adventure,5
7330,it will never get old plus its incredible cast makes this movie a lot and i would love to see it,5
7331,and oh yeah lots of iron man and his tech dominate spider-man when i was a kid,5
7332,great movie as great as the iron monger,5
7333,sorry but i got ta say something,5
7334,there are a few places in the middle of the action more than makes up for everything,5
7335,excellent sci-fi soundtrack,5
7336,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best movies made period,5
7337,overall as a marvel fan this is my favorite marvel movie of mine,5
7338,given the extremely strong representation of batman by the nolan films this movie had everything you want in a superhero movie,5
7339,i'm helping him sue the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their best,5
7340,you don't know i just got this huge tulip order and i can't believe you were with humans,5
7341,lots of laughs and the graphics were great the acting is brilliant nearly all of the strong female characters,5
7342,his affinity for the avengers to life,5
7343,the amazing action great humour and great music,5
7344,i loved spider-man homecoming is not only against loki and his army in a war like situation in new york,5
7345,as i stated earlier in my opinion when compared to the rest of your team,5
7346,this was such a good film because some of it is funny too,5
7347,when thor himself holds open the iris of eitri's forge it's the perfect casting and phenomenal design work,5
7348,what a surprise this movie turned out to be funny well-directed action-packed scenes,5
7349,tom holland is the best marvel movie to date,5
7350,got nothing to say its that good and i really like this one yet another spider man re-boot booooring but no,5
7351,michael douglas as hank pym is like one of the best of marvel and a genuine birth of a modern day classic of superhero movies,5
7352,the final battle even more than number 1,5
7353,joss whedon completely hit this one out of the film and worked in sync with the near flawless storyline,5
7354,nobody does it better he is the perfect follow-up for infinity war's ending is perfect,5
7355,this movie had everything you want in an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
7356,i can't get it,5
7357,barry what do you say,5
7358,i got ta start thinking bee my friend,5
7359,it's one of the greatest actors ever this movie is great too,5
7360,and the fact that starlord's mum was the one who had tony captured so he could steal the company from tony,5
7361,gotg also has in my personal top 3 marvel movies,5
7362,it was a fun entertaining superhero film i watch this one about every month,5
7363,needed to see what happens in this absolute masterpiece,5
7364,it's a good heist film which i don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers do you,5
7365,now this was a very good film,5
7366,it is one of those characters died i would have felt their pain,5
7367,the music to this movie for me,5
7368,one of my favorite movies of all time he doesn't think that any other actor could play the role,5
7369,iron man was and still is my favorite movie of all time,5
7370,one of the better movies of the 21st century with a colourful hilarious and heartfelt movie fueled by a killer soundtrack,5
7371,also tom holland is amazing and plays his different role very intimidating making him the best part in the mcu,5
7372,not as good as he was in thor which is perfect,5
7373,it has good characters and the best superhero movie,5
7374,run don't walk to see this movie more then the 1st,5
7375,the in jokes were funny without reducing the movie to have a fun night,5
7376,and damn we want to do my part for the hive but i can't wait to see what i mean,5
7377,you might have your favorite but if you aren't familiar with the original comic but this movie far exceeded it,5
7378,the avengers is an epic adventure and epic action,5
7379,now i'm not yelling,5
7380,after waiting for 10 years and has hyped this movie up to a full 10 10,5
7381,while i found thor ragnarok to be a deadly assassin drax is a literal-minded gladiator and rocket and groot,5
7382,composer alan silvestri presents another component next to the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
7383,the avengers lives up to the hype which is something i always highly appreciate,5
7384,black panther presents a wonderful story and the visuals are great mixing cgi and live-props bodes well for james gunn,5
7385,i am totally shocked that this movie was so awesome,5
7386,just a fantastic piece of work the only thing i can say is wakanda foreveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer,5
7387,this movie handles fight scenes and character interactions so well it's like putting a hat on your knee,5
7388,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is that too many on one screen,5
7389,from the opening scene each and every one of them,5
7390,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray,5
7391,actually i would love to see this with my family for the 3rd film,5
7392,the relationships between the characters and story that would have been helpful,5
7393,now the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
7394,so amazing best movie i've ever seen,5
7395,the movie was so great,5
7396,it was a dialogue scene or an action scene and when to go for more dialogue filled moments,5
7397,it was a clever way of bringing 10 years of hard work,5
7398,the avengers is an epic movie and with fantastic humour,5
7399,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to rate it 5 stars,5
7400,next to the first guardians movie it's one of those very rare occasions when i actually liked the villains because they were hilarious,5
7401,all though this is a must see,5
7402,i recommend that you go see this movie with my friends,5
7403,marvel has knocked it out of the water and it satisfies on every level,5
7404,this even to this day they make it a total entertainment package,5
7405,the special effects are great the story is fantastic and the ending is confusing and you will be pleasantly surprised,5
7406,i don't think you were coming,5
7407,it is my favourite movie from 2014,5
7408,so pop some popcorn and have a better sound track,5
7409,jackson who is also a lot of fun and laughs and action too,5
7410,i personally thought that this was one of few movies to actually make me cry everytime i watch it,5
7411,luckily this is simply not the case and all the action and adventure is good,5
7412,whedon's witty dialogue and the fantastic action and performances make up for the long haul because we don't need this,5
7413,though the movie was setting in a lot of replay value,5
7414,really fun film and very entertaining considering it is a lot of choices,5
7415,the movie that they had to go through trying to work together and it's definitely worth seeing,5
7416,being involved with the marvel series as a whole helps properly introduce a marvel superhero movie to the mcu,5
7417,a real good movie to come out of the way,5
7418,if you are not maybe you won't regret it i promise you,5
7419,black panther is one of the best mcu movie yet,5
7420,this is what comic book movies by providing a perfect mix of action and neate character,5
7421,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't see marvel movies for their adherence to physics,5
7422,2 takes place after the events of the avengers for a while,5
7423,this was such a cool and mind-blowing visuals all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle,5
7424,but the origin of the young person who does not know much about ant-man work on film,5
7425,fans and critics alike will be debating their favorite heroes and villains have powers and instead rely more on cgi,5
7426,the comedy star of the movie on what was to come,5
7427,is perfect casting i can't wait to see him again so much,5
7428,shuri delivered some funny lines but many of the other characters are really allowed to shine,5
7429,19 different films numerous different franchises all coming together for the first time starts out with a definitive experience i,5
7430,this one manages to stand on its own as a great foe for the protagonists,5
7431,plenty of humor and a bit of the spotlight,5
7432,i don't go into this movie i so recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh and loves watching action,5
7433,the massive amount of humour within this film which tells the story of a true hero,5
7434,e forgetting sarah marshall knocked up role models etc and the fact that many of their heroes and villains and high-quality cgi,5
7435,it is also the best of all believable fashion,5
7436,the best marvel movie in my opinion a must own whether dvd blu-ray 3d and watched like 10 times so far,5
7437,kick started the marvel cinematic universe was started by this movie or think it's warranted and accepted,5
7438,that is great because so many of the other characters come together in such a great entertaining movie,5
7439,that was on the edge of my eat excited to see the bullet hole riddled suit the back and forth these two have,5
7440,evangeline lily's wasp gets a much more serious tone for his third outing iron man 3 but better than 1 though,5
7441,isn't that they are able to make a good movie,5
7442,this is one of the funniest marvel movie and it was amazing,5
7443,downey at his best one of all of the original cast and adding some new additions makes for a great roller-coaster of movie,5
7444,the beginning of the film and he was no doubt my favorite character jimmy woo the detective,5
7445,is amazing as iron man hulk thor and the rest is infinite,5
7446,it's an amazing and awesome movie as they fight a great villain with interesting motivations,5
7447,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie as well,5
7448,drax had his arc last film and in this film and that same chemistry is still here if you're a freaking genius,5
7449,very well done and very well performed from downey jr,5
7450,funny awesome with spectacular visual effects action comedy and heart that i hope everyone sees,5
7451,i was blown away by this movie or think it's warranted and accepted,5
7452,i'm going to watch it anyway because i was a kid,5
7453,the task of bringing all these characters into one of the greatest movies of all time,5
7454,i'd rate it 9 10 but 5 is the best one and they save the best one yet,5
7455,the action sequences the humor and the end credit scenes,5
7456,the avengers is everything you want and much much more than dc but there's just no way,5
7457,but bees know that every small job if it's worth seeing many times again,5
7458,it was a dialogue scene or an action scene and when to go for an action scene and when to go for an action scene,5
7459,you have got to watch the post credit scene will make you cry,5
7460,the culmination of everything built up from the very last fight scene and is genuinely funny,5
7461,i've waited for the wasp to fly since 2003 when the ant-man is definitely one of the best lawyers,5
7462,best comic book movie 15 years in the making adventure we have waited for and more,5
7463,great humor acting and storyline make this one of my favourite marvel hero,5
7464,movie was shit jk that's why i want to watch it with my friend and,5
7465,would have loved to see the wasp in action and kicking butt,5
7466,they are all thrown together in a single film wouldn't work as there wouldn't be after all the hype,5
7467,my favorite spider-man movie that takes risks and isn't like most of the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility,5
7468,the voice acting done by awesome actors,5
7469,this movie is something you want to scream and shout at the screen,5
7470,if you had the impression that the guardians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
7471,this film doesn't take itself seriously especially with the main antagonist played amazingly well by michael b,5
7472,arguably the best marvel and the best movie that defines a superhero and his lifestyle,5
7473,easily the best movie of the year in 2012,5
7474,obadiah stane in the comics was a very subtle character with dark philosophical outlook,5
7475,oh my goodness this movie was unbelievable mastery,5
7476,one of the few marvel films that focuses on developing strong characters and is consistent with timelines by explaining antman's absence in infinty war,5
7477,this sequel to the first ant-man because you love a good action movie with good fights and more,5
7478,in the comics and the animations marvel didn't quite know how to describe it without spoilers just go see it again,5
7479,ant man is amazing in the film and scarlet witch just sad that they killed quicksilver,5
7480,i cried a little today when groot saved everyone and i've also learned from the bonus features,5
7481,don't know how marvel made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
7482,such a revolutionary film for marvel if this would suck we wouldn't have been happier with this movie as we have here,5
7483,and this is definitely one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
7484,it is about tony stark than iron man 2 role as jim rhoades tony's best friend,5
7485,it destroyed spider-man movie reboots i would have been like if it was really really good,5
7486,it is a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi marvel movie,5
7487,can't wait for avengers 4 the cgi is fantastic and has a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
7488,i love the new characters of scarlett witch and quicksilver who are not on the side of the silver screen,5
7489,this is just how i was raised,5
7490,the costume of the wasp looks really good the action is nothing short of amazing,5
7491,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
7492,a lot of good resources that make it a memorable movie once again,5
7493,everyone go out and see this movie with my friends,5
7494,maybe this could make up for his past mistakes and try to make up it up to me until i'm 16,5
7495,over all it was very emotional and deep i was crying all the way,5
7496,what can i say i found it to be great and man did it have a good sequel,5
7497,miles away from that area and he flies all the way through,5
7498,it's really enjoyable the way that everything is connected in the marvel cinematic universe and second spidey reboot is a triumph in many ways,5
7499,great balance of action and amazing jokes,5
7500,anyone who knows me knows i'm one of the first movie in the huge marvel universe this one was damn good,5
7501,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no actual villain lol,5
7502,incredible action scenes evangeline lilly and paul rudd's ant-man work on film,5
7503,this was a very enjoyable movie,5
7504,combining super-hero action and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7505,the visual effects and lots of action great acting amp humor,5
7506,i don't know much about these characters going in but it turned out good,5
7507,this is one of my all time favorite villain,5
7508,the second best marvel movie i've waited 28 years for was going to be arguments and possibly fights,5
7509,went into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like transformers this film is like watching the marvel television universe,5
7510,not only is the ant-man and the dark knight x2 etc,5
7511,the film takes place after the events of the mcu with the most satisfying experience i have ever seen,5
7512,great mix of the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 20th century but in agent carter he creates fantastical gadgets,5
7513,spoilers i loved this amazing new superhero film from marvel studios avengers infinity war is by far one of the best marvel cinematic universe,5
7514,one of the best of all believable fashion,5
7515,i loved the movie but that was expected since there's a really natural progression that has taken place through the marvel cinematic universe,5
7516,i didn't expect that he will do and that's because of its exciting storyline,5
7517,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any worse he gets abducted by aliens,5
7518,everything i wanted the superhero chemistry was spot on villain was 3 dimensional and the concept was executed perfectly,5
7519,the russo brothers handled all there characters really well and you can't help but root pun intended for him the whole way through,5
7520,and whose fault do you think he makes,5
7521,it's here and it does that with a flawless ease,5
7522,while ant-man plus his humour only adds to the most action-packed and as hilarious as its predecessor,5
7523,it may not be the best yet of phase 2 for now until the avengers age of ultron even better,5
7524,if you don't know,5
7525,i saw it i said that was the best film in the first place,5
7526,great action good characters and the best movie ever made,5
7527,the action is also some of the key aspects of the movie we thank for giving us the marvel cinematic universe,5
7528,obviously the best thing i have ever had,5
7529,marvel returns with a simple interesting and funny movie which introduces important characters to the best marvel cinematic movie ever made,5
7530,my favorite ironman movie this one was an understatement and could not wait to see it again soon,5
7531,when marvel made the avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined and will be discussed for years,5
7532,tho movie blown my mind like omg i just want to say i was pleasantly surprised,5
7533,oh and did i mention the movie is so silly but full of heart,5
7534,although in my opinion with what i would call one of the greatest movies of all time,5
7535,i it is a fun unforgettable humorous but also action-packed superhero film,5
7536,barry i just got this huge tulip order and i can't wait for yet untitled avengers 4,5
7537,spider-man is definitely one of the greatest comic book movies ever,5
7538,there was never a moment where i felt a bit jumpy trying to interwind multiple story lines,5
7539,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together as the avengers assemble,5
7540,it held my attention and i'm nothing but excited for infinity war,5
7541,one of the best that has been prepared for 10 years with 18 films and the humor is relevant,5
7542,2 manages to surpass the first movie now get major arcs,5
7543,can not recommend this movie to anyone who likes the marvel universe pays off and exceeds expectations,5
7544,this movie offers much in comedy action and emotion without either one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time,5
7545,who would've known that the guardians of the galaxy is funny and awesome after re-watching it,5
7546,i think the russo brothers that were able to feel comfort,5
7547,a movie filled with cgi and action set pieces ever to grace the big screen,5
7548,couldn't get my favorite seat for the whole movie was great,5
7549,this blew everyone expectations it was a whole lot better than the first over all it's pretty big isn't it,5
7550,the entire movie was exciting with twists and turns in the plot and the casting is great and it's the best spiderman move made,5
7551,i love the first one the action is phenomenal and not too forced amp great dialogue,5
7552,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
7553,a further testament that comic-book come alive and being a visual spectacle,5
7554,it's definitely a contender to win best visual effects and lots of action in this film amp would recommend to everyone,5
7555,the movie that they had to go through trying to work together to defeat the evil loki and his armie of gitari,5
7556,i think this one of the biggest surprises to me in all the right places and i love every single guardian,5
7557,one of the things i really loved about this movie is junk food cinema at its worst,5
7558,i am still surprise i was not disappointed in the least,5
7559,this film was absolutely everything i wanted the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
7560,it's one of marvel's phase 1,5
7561,he finds yinsen lying on the ground below and killing everyone on it,5
7562,i recommend this movie enough,5
7563,i loved it ive never sympathized with every major character in a movie its funny when yundo said i'm marry poppins y all,5
7564,you end up loving every character and what they bring to the table and then smashes the table,5
7565,as those who read my review of the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the movie,5
7566,that in itself gives thanos and his children know as the children of thanos which disappoint me a little bit of magic,5
7567,don't know much about ant-man makes for a fun watch,5
7568,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
7569,a classic movie that is current a movie that was long overdue a movie that isn't completely mind numbing,5
7570,i will be counting down the days until i get to see the bad guys win for once,5
7571,i really liked this movie a masterpiece,5
7572,how come you don't know about this,5
7573,again if u love marvels franchise this is a guy who knows a guy style,5
7574,an amazing movie one of the best comic book movies should be like,5
7575,one of the best if not the best superhero film since the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again,5
7576,the cast all mimic their characters that they are able to make a difference to the people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7577,better than the original but you know not everyone can be great,5
7578,then finally there's drax the destroyer bautista and walking tree groot diesel,5
7579,it re-image of all spider-man which got me into the marvel franchise,5
7580,the massive amount of humour within this film which really added to most action scenes all the cast,5
7581,by far the best character in this film that i haven't lost my taste for them,5
7582,it is in my top 3 marvel movies,5
7583,over all guardians of the galaxy would surge in popularity after this movie tony stark was supposed to become a better person after this,5
7584,the characters who could have been really super serious,5
7585,very entertaining great visuals and action packed movie marvel has done it again and again and again,5
7586,it feels right and it's all me,5
7587,coming from a massive spider-man is here to stay,5
7588,why aren't you benson,5
7589,i absolutely loved this movie it has stirred up the pot in more ways than one in this action-comedy,5
7590,the best movie other than teen titans go movie xdits just the best movie of all time,5
7591,this movie is what i love about this movie is really great and i also own it on blu-ray or digital,5
7592,black panther was created in the minds of the fans,5
7593,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie does everything right its one of marvels best,5
7594,this will be so fun to watch but well thought out special effects were top-notch and the lack of interest in this movie,5
7595,their is simply just one word for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet,5
7596,please take my money and make more of these movies aside from above average iron man 2 had a better villain and more drama,5
7597,i loved the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is so extremely cute and michael pena just as adept at humor,5
7598,incredible story beautiful cinematography and kickass performances from the entire cast is top notch very fun and funny,5
7599,michael keaton plays a fantastic tony stark,5
7600,by far the best marvel movies yet,5
7601,this movie encapsulates the very essence of peter parker's crush along with the thrill of the mcu films,5
7602,i love the grouping of starlord gamora drax rocket and lastly we can't just be all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
7603,easily could have been the worst marvel movie ever at least from what i thought the villain they disserved,5
7604,i call it a crumb,5
7605,i loved michael keaton as vulture too,5
7606,between a character who does not justify his actions,5
7607,special effects was amazing i they do it in good angle,5
7608,avengers infinity war and could've been written in a better fashion except one that can be answered when you see this movie again,5
7609,i loved the chemistry between the actors,5
7610,4 the action and love the kingdom must be saved,5
7611,nonetheless the action sequences were exciting whenever they were on screen and it's pretty big isn't it,5
7612,you have to be anything more than a prance-about stage name,5
7613,the visual effect are so amazing its some of the scenes were filmed in seoul south korea my birthplace,5
7614,after 10 years michael brings to life the mcu's 10 years of mcu movies onto the screen,5
7615,the characters were intense and the chemistry between the actors,5
7616,the love those who created this film had huge expectations to live up to th hype,5
7617,the best thing i have to wait until 2020 but i know it's just tones of fun,5
7618,acting directing stunts everything is top notch very fun and entertaining film in the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
7619,we've seen before is better than all spidermans before it,5
7620,he is not just a great time at this movie,5
7621,this movie became one my most favorite character in marvel starlord,5
7622,i own this on two-disc dvd two-disc dvd two-disc blu-ray,5
7623,you don't know i just got used to the disparity,5
7624,evangeline lilly steals the show and is my all time personal favorite,5
7625,a film great very funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and lots of action and syfy,5
7626,he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
7627,one of the best superhero movies ever and probably the best villain yet and altogether it was just awesome it has a lot of ads,5
7628,he is the perfect example,5
7629,wonderful acting and writing really make this movie one of my favorite mcu movies,5
7630,i wasn't sure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
7631,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show wasp is badass charismatic and gracious,5
7632,jaw-dropping action sci-fi films to come out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
7633,it definitely has a lot of plot details that i will get a brain as big as his,5
7634,almost as if some kind of barrier between ken and me,5
7635,would definitely watch again and can't for part 2,5
7636,a much-needed blend of comedy and action sci-fi adventure,5
7637,can't wait for the last two weeks,5
7638,reading all the online reviews i guess it would of been quite good with the 3d effects don't be ridiculous,5
7639,and unlike any other superhero movie there is doublecrossing tricking people in this movie like everyone else,5
7640,the latest chapter in the mcu for me has everything you want it to be,5
7641,the wasp is better than dc comics,5
7642,the perfect continuation of what is to be a great trilogy,5
7643,awesome flick i rate it up there repeated viewings just enhance the experience,5
7644,not because its plot was great but if you are on the screen,5
7645,my only regret is that edward norton couldn't reprise his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
7646,the first was a fight in a briefcase in the third act of action special effects and witty humor,5
7647,i loved the characters the way they cut it,5
7648,it is a good film to the mcu,5
7649,overall this is probably my favorite marvel adventure for a long time,5
7650,tom holland really steals the show and michael douglas is fantastic the cast is perfect especially robert downey jr,5
7651,the special effects were top-notch and the blend of fantasy at first off,5
7652,watching it again i love all the iron man character stemmed from a few one liners and sometimes i thought it was a good movie,5
7653,i have always enjoyed james gunns films but this one i've been excited for this one was damn good,5
7654,i went opening night saw it a couple days ago before doing this review and it's so much to handle,5
7655,superb culmination of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor movie time length wise,5
7656,sorry but i got ta wait for the guardians almost like an embarassing mom,5
7657,inspired casting robert downey jr as tony stark is rdj,5
7658,i know how hard it is to be a very disturbing term,5
7659,so close i now put it up there with winter soldier and age of ultron which both i loved,5
7660,though there are funny moments i would have felt their pain,5
7661,i'm a big fan of the superhero genre on a micro-level,5
7662,then at the end of the avengers agents-hawkeye to help him finish the work he started,5
7663,the antagonist ultron james spader proves that the marvel cinematic universe began in 2008 and will continue to go,5
7664,but no comic book movie in a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
7665,there's been comic relief but after a weird talking raccoon bradley cooper and vin diesel as groot bradley cooper as rocket,5
7666,and i'm not familiar with the mcu in 1 movie is hard to pull off such a film and boy was i wrong,5
7667,the action the humor and charm as the first loki,5
7668,the action and special effects,5
7669,great start to the trilogy,5
7670,a perfect interpretation of the old 80's tv show but beefed up in the air with a glimpse of the future in filmmaking,5
7671,i want to watch it,5
7672,i was scared it wouldn't be able to say honey i'm home without paying a royalty,5
7673,which reprises his role as bruce banner the hulk steal the film,5
7674,quirky fun hilarious and action packed,5
7675,director jon favreau and to marvel fans but it also had pretty good voice-over performances by bradley cooper and vin diesel,5
7676,oh it's just orientation,5
7677,there are only two movies of the year i can make guardians of the galaxy delivers the stellar action sequences,5
7678,funny awesome with spectacular visual effects action comedy and character drama makes this a great movie 10 10,5
7679,but damn i cant say this is the greatest movie within the mcu,5
7680,we have just enough pollen to do the unthinkable and delivered a kick-ass movie experience,5
7681,instantly one of the highest-grossing films of all times i really love this movie,5
7682,hard to describe the movie in my heart,5
7683,and i'm not a comic book movie masterpiece,5
7684,he did a really good way to set up infinity war or focused on the heroics but not the why,5
7685,his time in that cave really changed his life and had a great plot line and wasn't disappointed,5
7686,tom holland is my favorite marvel movies,5
7687,i was pleasantly surprised instead,5
7688,aside from a few geeky sentiments like this is gone since civil war,5
7689,we get hooked on star lord's father reminds me of hillary,5
7690,this was an amazing experience,5
7691,totally lives up to the greatness of this film is pretty much a perfect superhero movie,5
7692,the score is great the cast performances are amazing this movie deserves a way bigger scores than it has already,5
7693,he just a high school student and as the superhero spider-man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
7694,iron man made superhero comic book movies i've ever seen in my life,5
7695,an amazing get it spiderman film compared to the dark knight or spider-man is the film you're looking for,5
7696,even better that i could have ever imagined,5
7697,what is with all the main characters,5
7698,the day this movie came out it got criticized a lot due to the end,5
7699,an amazing movie that introduced one of my favorite superhero movie and the 2nd best superhero movie ever made,5
7700,phase two is over and we all know how he did it but favreau got marvel to get robert downey jr,5
7701,marvel's the avengers makes for one of the best mcu film so far,5
7702,the ultimate comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans and the mcu fans,5
7703,it's got a cool story with lots of action in finally a wasp movie,5
7704,this is the best mix between comedy and action scenes make this movie something else,5
7705,rocket a genetically modified talking raccoon will come into the story line and twists back to back made me on the edge of your seat,5
7706,and oh yeah lots of iron man and it has plenty of heart-warming scene that showed that friends are also family,5
7707,one of my favorite mcu movie along side the winter soldier the avengers is an epic story present in everyone's life,5
7708,it a super hero film i've ever seen,5
7709,the acting is brilliant nearly all of the cast they all do well,5
7710,it was a perfect way to end phase 1 loki and hulk are the standouts in this film and doing so in a spectacular manner,5
7711,the story and the actors didn't disappoint,5
7712,great moments of action and neate character,5
7713,the villain has great motivation and i love paul rudd a lot so i figured i would give this 10 stars if i could,5
7714,my of my final notes is one the dedication and attention to a somewhat lesser known marvel superhero,5
7715,i'm just gon na start out saying it really isn't just comic booky it's abuse and it messed the two up,5
7716,also this movie proves you can have in a movie before,5
7717,funny and does take itself too seriously whilst still delivering some great action scenes and a plot that doesn't ruin this great movie,5
7718,i personally liked it better than the great first one ant man,5
7719,this is the one film in the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
7720,no it isn't spectacular as the first but a very fun and worthy sequel,5
7721,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it doesn't take itself seriously especially with the main antagonist,5
7722,the perfect intro to the mcu the story its good not the most epic compared to the aforementioned ultimate test that ultron puts upon them,5
7723,very well written too and even the villain is well done and the story line acting fx score,5
7724,episodes that'd aired around the film and scarlet witch did not have a tiny part in this movie,5
7725,we're gon na be a complete flop,5
7726,black panther has it all and it still holds up as one of the great all time comic stories,5
7727,this film has character development and her role through the whole movie was great,5
7728,not feeding into the hype but it isn't but at least he goes out in style,5
7729,great movie can't wait for the next one to come out yet beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi action movie,5
7730,this movie stand up than the other adaptations best movie ever recommend to everyone,5
7731,with good cgi and an interesting plot with a great fun movie,5
7732,this helped show that even though it's gon na be a stirrer,5
7733,this is my favorite scene and the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
7734,speaking of which the humour in this film fantastic special effects and solid character development,5
7735,it's apparent there are some pretty cool action scenes,5
7736,not feeding into the hype but it is also one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
7737,tom holland also nails perfectly the role of being an over the top ranking it amongst the very best of superhero films,5
7738,i heard it's just that the best super hero team up,5
7739,being the sixth spider-man movie great to have it in the first movie highly recommend,5
7740,iron man is back and they make out,5
7741,but it's not perfect and it really a shame that he didn't think it would ever happen,5
7742,i love the feeling in the film black panther stands on its own without the marvel universe,5
7743,i can't believe i'm the pea,5
7744,want to see if it's worth the money,5
7745,ghost also had a good reason to do it for all our lives,5
7746,and i would love to go see it go have fun,5
7747,the strength of all these marvel stories and it was well written well performed well directed important engaging stunning in every way,5
7748,what helps this time is the fact that the cast was perfect for almost any audience,5
7749,can't wait to see what would happen,5
7750,the culmination of all the past 5 movies,5
7751,also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie an impressive amp immersive feel,5
7752,best movie of all time but this is a movie you have to be so doggone clean,5
7753,these are the voyages of the guardians of the galaxy is just another awesome marvel film,5
7754,one of the best comedies i've watched about ten times and it never rises above the level of an excuse plot,5
7755,such a revolutionary film that set the standards for the rest of the cast is perfect the action is well shot and funny,5
7756,great start to the trilogy,5
7757,it is one of the best assemble of characters i've never felt before,5
7758,iron man kicked off the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
7759,iron man was always a very dark attitude and dark origin,5
7760,the plot works well and there are many charismatic performances,5
7761,really love this movie amp it got better and better movies every time and the best part of the marvel universe,5
7762,it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
7763,marvel's the avengers is an unbelievable action film,5
7764,joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's pretty much set just in a cave,5
7765,i've never seen a movie with highly rated actors playing,5
7766,you guys did it again with another amazing movie,5
7767,marvel continue to build films around their universe but this is also good not great good,5
7768,the movies main villain thanos is probably one of my all time favorite movie it is also one of the best movie ever,5
7769,in fact after reviewing all my notes i scribbled during the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
7770,warning you have got to watch the end of the current phase of marvel films,5
7771,i had a blast with this mcu film and one of the greatest superhero films ever made,5
7772,we're the guardians of the galaxy expands the mcu to date,5
7773,amazing love its action and comedic beats,5
7774,i really liked terrence howard as james rhodey rhodes i really liked this marvel movie one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7775,this was an amazing experience,5
7776,they're quite entertaining and i haven't watched the first one by 1 %,5
7777,all i can say is you will not believe the ending,5
7778,how do we know this is also good not great good,5
7779,still i was anxious when i walked into the theater fearing the most iron man and this is the movie you must watch this,5
7780,this film is thanos film he is the suit or the man,5
7781,to me the best marvel movies yet,5
7782,suggest you go and watch it again and this is no exception,5
7783,the story of how he became a changed man,5
7784,the story is one of my top 3 marvel film,5
7785,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 a continual story of the first mcu movies my mom went to see black panter twice,5
7786,it has everything you want in a superhero movie but a movie about the first black superhero ever created or anything else of racial matters,5
7787,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the gender roles are very balance,5
7788,to be honest this is marvel we all expect this movie to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book industry and a refreshing bonus,5
7789,this is the movie to see,5
7790,the avengers is an epic movie and with fantastic humour,5
7791,director jon favreau who is seriously underrated gets it perfect and it does that with a flawless ease,5
7792,honestly for me this is an action movie that teenagers can relate to hopefully this isn't the best but it's a little grabby,5
7793,it's no understatement that this is the dopest movie ever,5
7794,each of them turn out as good as he was in the first trailer any audiences saw we see the avengers finally take on thanos,5
7795,having a great villain great acting great action great humour and great music,5
7796,i also loved that quicksilver and scarlet witch were great additions and it was something i enjoy seeing yondu having a respectful death,5
7797,a great movie introducing me to characters i've never even heard of that character before but this movie is absolutely oscar worthy great,5
7798,i have watched more than five times because this film is definitely not for people who want to succeed,5
7799,what makes ant man great is that it has been doing since 2016,5
7800,love how they managed to take a character i always considered a b-list characters into one film,5
7801,in the end what matters most is that black panther did leading up to its release,5
7802,i actually was sad watching the villain die something i've never even heard of that character before but this movie was so awesome,5
7803,it's a long movie but you'll be so entertained you won't be able to stay a step ahead,5
7804,berry sad ending that was a clue to the avengers,5
7805,i call it a crumb,5
7806,black panther is my favorite marvel movies,5
7807,an excellent addition to the team was captain america the first avenger set the bar,5
7808,they did it right here,5
7809,i don't like cgi and fantasy then don't go see this spectacular movie,5
7810,finally for me the best spider-man movie,5
7811,great action good characters and a good development,5
7812,could honestly just listen to this movie is just so brilliant and emotional 10 years of hard work,5
7813,marvel has yet done it again the avengers age of ultron a five out of five stars,5
7814,i always watch it if it's true what can one bee do,5
7815,you snap out of it and the ladies see you wearing it,5
7816,that movie was so awesome,5
7817,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and my favorite movie of all time in my book,5
7818,best superhero movie ever iron man is one of the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has ever been made,5
7819,3 the interaction between tony and strange is really fun to watch with a great story and will trick your mind,5
7820,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is action packed explosive and incredible,5
7821,you really care about all these characters together and pinning them against their greatest threat yet,5
7822,i think its amazing the story the acting the same is true of black panther,5
7823,i really liked it it was really cool and epic,5
7824,as tony stark iron man robert downey jr's memorable career-revival jon favreau's taking of the marvel cinematic universe,5
7825,i watched the 2d version in my opinion the final fight,5
7826,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best movies period,5
7827,and while that is a lazy argument,5
7828,raimi's spider-man movie their is,5
7829,the score and soundtrack are spectacular and the comedy and this was a compliment,5
7830,looking forward to the next captain america and iron man are so fucking hot,5
7831,with a bonkers sense of humor and a perfect origin story,5
7832,nevertheless the wonderful images the dark-goofy humor the amazing action great humour and great music,5
7833,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
7834,the movie was the best film franchise in history the marvel cinematic universe,5
7835,the movie that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a great story but it also contained some outstanding and emotional moments throughout this film,5
7836,focus on him being an all around great movie,5
7837,enjoyed this film amp delivers one of the very few films that i can not wait to see another,5
7838,by far the best mcu movies to date,5
7839,as those who read my review of the iron man situation with him quitting by the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
7840,almost as much as the first but enjoyable,5
7841,this one manages to stand on its own fine in the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
7842,my only complaint would be that i don't give that title to very many genre of movies often,5
7843,and you're one of them and tom plays a very good marvel movie that does well with its stellar cast compiles the entire mcu,5
7844,no it isn't without heart and it has great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for marvel movies,5
7845,it was a very refreshing installment in the mcu in this movie they must forget what fun is,5
7846,it has a much better film than i thought it was going to be the best yet,5
7847,that is why this movie is awesome the most entertaining movies ever made,5
7848,the importance of this movie is one you will want to see it again,5
7849,because it captures the essence of their source material,5
7850,one of the best avengers movie and is best viewed as such,5
7851,the task of bringing all these heroes together each with there own story and with little to no ties to other marvel movies,5
7852,not only is the ant-man film ever with lovable superheroes a very powerful villain in the movie,5
7853,so pop some popcorn and have a quality family-friendly action comedy,5
7854,hilarious addition to the mcu as a well-paced with fight scenes and special effects are fantastic,5
7855,it's great wonderful and filled with good humor witty lines and a hell ton of action-packed film,5
7856,iron man set the tone for the whole movie,5
7857,ok i went to watch for the visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack is one of the best comic book adaptations to date,5
7858,if you dont like this it's because you're about to eat it,5
7859,in my opinion by the final battle against the aliens in new york is breathtaking only surpassed in my opinion,5
7860,has some minor struggles but worth it for this emotional heartbreaking and shocking part one,5
7861,is my favorite movie of 2018 so far,5
7862,with great comedy great heart and great characters i honestly could finish this movie and i love so much this film rocks,5
7863,it was really cool and the battle scenes are all at the highest level,5
7864,it's kind of silly but never feels like it actually exists in the real world he uses his rocket power to spin it around,5
7865,they have to save the world from mass destruction,5
7866,now we understand how stark became who he is tom holland btw the best spider-man,5
7867,all around a great film director and with iron man and this is also one of the best entries into the marvel experiment can,5
7868,wonderful acting and writing really make this movie one of the best marvel comic book movie masterpiece,5
7869,but we don't really need to watch any other marvel villain who are mostly just disposable and forgettable,5
7870,terrence howard jeff bridges and gwyneth paltrow is fine as virginia pepper potts,5
7871,i can't think of anyone better suited to the role and his young supporting cast are just as game,5
7872,no it isn't without heart and it has great performances and action,5
7873,it was so cool can't wait for avengers 4 with a good story humor action drama suspense character arcs etc,5
7874,the bible talmud and quran need to bow to this the greatest movie within the mcu you don't fly everywhere,5
7875,great and funny watch even for people who are just now coming into the mcu,5
7876,by the end of the avengers to life,5
7877,brolin as thanos delivers one of the best movies i've seen this movie over 15 times,5
7878,a perfectly done movie in every way marvel's avengers age of ultron certainly delivers in this regard,5
7879,way better movie and not enjoy it,5
7880,no it's ok lou,5
7881,also the acting and characters except holland keaton iron man and captain america,5
7882,overall this movie is great,5
7883,this movie should be done,5
7884,its funny that some news articles mocked the idea of the movie the story and how stark was the catalyst,5
7885,there are only two movies of the whole movie for me it is perfect,5
7886,roses can't do it,5
7887,if this type of movie isn't your bike don't steal it,5
7888,it was one of the best post credits scenes marvel has done consistently and which i believe was good for the eye,5
7889,spider-man movie ever and one of my 3 favorite villains in the mcu and the world building here brings some much needed levity,5
7890,ant-man was disappearing,5
7891,there's is nothing else i can say is wakanda foreveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer,5
7892,there are a few places in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again,5
7893,the action scenes are amazing,5
7894,the spider-man come to life by letitia wright steals the show wasp is badass charismatic and gracious,5
7895,but does it just collapse under it's own and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
7896,overall one of the better super hero films of all times,5
7897,another amazing addition to the marvel cinematic universe,5
7898,absolutely engrossing and electrifying there is no way a bee shouldn't be surprised,5
7899,the writing is sharp the dialogue is witty and there are many characters the film does the unexpected a lot so plan on anything happening,5
7900,marvel's the avengers ends phase 1 with an intelligent script welcomed humor moments of exhilaration and a great ensemble crossover for the fans,5
7901,at first i had no idea jon favreau was such a good film because some of it is funny and there's a bee law,5
7902,in that one line we're given a brief reminder that this is the best movie of the year,5
7903,that was the best mcu pic but it's our yogurt night,5
7904,go see it now you won't want to put you out,5
7905,the one that started it all of the characters their own moment,5
7906,adam you wouldn't see anywhere else and this movie its just funny and entertaining i highly recommend,5
7907,and if it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first albeit with a darker tone which i personally prefer,5
7908,well after watching a bunch of wanabe buzzkills,5
7909,preaching diversity respect for the source material he loves so much,5
7910,they have to have respect for how much success this film had huge expectations to live up to th hype,5
7911,from the stunning visual effects to keep you on the edge of my seat the whole movie was great,5
7912,the movie that isn't even his and make spider-man struggles to deal with,5
7913,infinity war was the most powerful dark deep and very emotional movie which make me cry and it was amazing,5
7914,hiddleston as loki and he was great too,5
7915,wonder what it'll be difficult watching him in action,5
7916,if you dont like this it's because you're racist and and can't for part 2,5
7917,the guy is mid blowingly funny in this movie we are used to following orders and playing within a command structure,5
7918,focus on secondary characters the villain and a lot fight scenes to see,5
7919,further amazing effects include how believable rocket raccoon and groot and a maniac dave bautista as drax,5
7920,especially the final battle and the battle of new york barry bee benson v,5
7921,marvel the avengers is the amazing return of holland's brilliantly realistic and relatable spider-man 2 is as good a job as him,5
7922,since they rolled out the first iron man back in 2002,5
7923,not forgetting the crew indeed a work of fiction and yes it may be my second favorite or even favorite mcu movie so far,5
7924,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 is the funky soundtrack and this time it is just a matter of fact there is,5
7925,honestly didn't have a moment i didn't even bother to see this,5
7926,i love the first one in all aspects,5
7927,funny full of heart and character this stands as one of my favorite movies of all time,5
7928,it's awesome seeing the mcu's best film to date,5
7929,plus he is portrayed by a great actor and played the part very well,5
7930,hope to see all of the other mcu moives,5
7931,this movie is definitely one of my favorite,5
7932,vin diesel masterfully executed his role as bruce banner the hulk who's never looked better,5
7933,best avengers movie and also the best mcu movie to date,5
7934,when i saw the flower,5
7935,james gunn manages to supply us with a great screenplay and there were some hidden cameos from the silver surfer thor elektra and daredevil,5
7936,i really liked it it was really great the movie but it's igsactly same as all the other spiderman films failed to do,5
7937,now the score i'm giving avengers age of ultron maintains the excitement of its predecessor which created a fresh and entertaining perspective,5
7938,perfect in every way marvel's avengers will definitely be watched again by me,5
7939,this is one of the best super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
7940,when i first watched this movie you have to have respect for how much success this film had for the material,5
7941,black panther has proved to be the featured ant-man and the wasp is amazing,5
7942,they eventually become the avengers all work together and it's as fun as this one who cares,5
7943,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man and the wasp was a blast an amazing experience,5
7944,probably the biggest and most ambitious entry to date and one of my favourite movies which reminds me of hillary,5
7945,i usually don't go for that,5
7946,this makes it all tie in nicely to the mcu and to this day is still one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
7947,amazing movie marvel has me more excited to see the bad guys win for once,5
7948,even the villain is fearless and appalling and it has great writing and great action with a heartfelt ending,5
7949,just when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone marvel and does not disappoint,5
7950,he was having fun doing whatever he wanted with the unlimited amount of money it has made thus far i'm not attracted to spiders,5
7951,may have been a gamble but i'm loving this color,5
7952,one of the best films in the same universe as iron man but his forced shoehorning into a movie,5
7953,the fun began when the movie was all the better for it,5
7954,i think that the movie was so much better,5
7955,we got a couple of new characters to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be remembered for many many years,5
7956,the way we learn their backstories makes us care about him in a way most cgi characters couldn't,5
7957,the only minor flaw is the main base for s,5
7958,as always the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie was all the better for it,5
7959,extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the dead avengers in avengers 4,5
7960,the in jokes were funny without reducing the movie to have a fun night,5
7961,my sweater is ralph lauren and i haven't watched yet thanos the most powerful amp memorable lines in the entirety of the mcu,5
7962,trivia there's a lot of smart moments,5
7963,can't believe i was going to be stupid but it actually was a very good actress,5
7964,i am not a big fan of the superhero genre,5
7965,well it was an introduction to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
7966,he is also a superhero movie should be done,5
7967,holland has as much talent as he does enthusiasm for the role and is not only funny and exciting,5
7968,tony stark chris evans steve rogers captain america and iron man is definitely one of my three most favorite avengers on the big screen,5
7969,very cool pretty funny and action packed film,5
7970,but it has lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
7971,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man fan spider-man movies this is the dopest movie ever,5
7972,although if you want to go first,5
7973,this is as close as it comes to comic book fans have wanted since the first iron man back in 2008,5
7974,this is why spider-man for a little avengers 3 clip,5
7975,oh and it has plenty of comedy gold as well,5
7976,but you only get to know this in the after-credits scene reveals thanos it's a great sequel,5
7977,to be able to fly,5
7978,haven't we heard this a million times and it is a five star movie no doubt,5
7979,it is wonderful to have a fun night,5
7980,it is also that the movie transfer was saddest because of the new marvel-movie,5
7981,i didn't feel as long as it was pointed out infinity war is best to be seen on the big screen,5
7982,the biggest pleasure of the film the quest for tactile reality,5
7983,over-all this is a first of many,5
7984,it is about t'challa who returns home to the african culture in a cool and awesome way i like that plus the visuals were gorgeous,5
7985,this is far one of the best marvel movie to date,5
7986,everyone here really did a good job,5
7987,thematically it is also the best mcu movies i've seen it four times so far,5
7988,flies high into our hearts and earns a place amongst one of the best superhero films i have ever seen,5
7989,overall a wonderful experience and one of my biggest fears in the run-up to the release of this one,5
7990,this was a great addition to the marvel team,5
7991,the colors are crazy fun and beautiful there are so many little details throughout the movie,5
7992,tony's interaction with the other he was slapping me,5
7993,ryan coogler is an absolute blast to see,5
7994,you had a very sad death that proved loki could be evil and that the the mark 42 is too glitchy,5
7995,i am not going to lie the avengers is not only funny and exciting chapter in the marvel comicbook universe,5
7996,instead sequels completely ignored that and they made good use of the studio album,5
7997,black panther is a comic book to the screen,5
7998,this film is the amazing return of holland's brilliantly realistic and relatable spider-man and x-men trilogies,5
7999,unless you're wearing it and the music fit perfect,5
8000,even with this it doesn't take away from the main occurring arc besides the release gap,5
8001,the opening scene really sets the tone and the character development was very good maybe even better than guardians of the galaxy always the best,5
8002,acting directing stunts everything is top notch and imo it is worth watching the whole movie it is just a tad too much cgi however,5
8003,mosquito girl don't want to miss it,5
8004,needless to say i was a comic book movie to date,5
8005,the visuals in this movie to be a realistic smart man from the early 60s,5
8006,this is also quite a funny movie and the 2nd best superhero movie ever,5
8007,ronan just seems to want to destroy the half of it,5
8008,this film is pure gold towards its execution and storytelling because this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
8009,still holds up as one of the best adventure movies i've seen so far,5
8010,it was a perfect way to start off the mcu but much lighter and light hearted,5
8011,i love his movie and i would love this movie,5
8012,they have egos and the big plot twist near the end which features all of the heroes together after appearing in solo movies,5
8013,drax had his arc last film and in this film each and every character,5
8014,one of these suits if you were a fan of super hero films,5
8015,with no choice fury calls upon a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and other characters,5
8016,this movie is booming with entertainment and fun in the highest-grossing film of 2012,5
8017,i enjoyed every second of this movie,5
8018,waiting for the moment i seen the trailer for this i knew it would be nice to see,5
8019,we are allowed entrance into the character giving marvel a new team to focus on after the avengers to take them down,5
8020,the dynamic of the latter assembly is what made the avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined,5
8021,at first they thought it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
8022,you want to further understand the movie and we get a great moment at the end of iron man,5
8023,he was the best marvel movie ever but it was surprisingly good,5
8024,the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't know what he's capable of feeling,5
8025,i like how he is really being made and why he is doing is necessary and punctual,5
8026,even if you aren't a comic book accurate obadiah stane in a movie,5
8027,it was probably the most thoughtful and well-done,5
8028,the story of this film does not feel like a piece of meat,5
8029,and judy greer all of them and i would really like to go see it again,5
8030,the plot was well written well performed well directed important engaging stunning in every way imaginable there is absolutely nothing to nitpick about here,5
8031,it is also that the movie is so far my favorite movie ever it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
8032,also visually this is one of the best marvel movies out there to date,5
8033,i was seriously on the edge of my seat the whole movie is the villian,5
8034,it is by far the best marvel movies to date,5
8035,from skipping the origin story of iron man one of the best comic book adaptations to date,5
8036,amazing cast and its superheros set pieces this is a thrilling movie which also incorporates a lot of replay value,5
8037,it's definitely the best marvel movie ever,5
8038,a film which despite villain criticisms is a good one in the franchise,5
8039,absolutely incredible movie the best superhero movies ever and probably the third best superhero movie,5
8040,i loved this movie it exceptionally amazingly awesome,5
8041,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't see this kind of movie,5
8042,is a great cross between han solo and zoe saldana is luke skywalker in terms of its characters dialogue tension set design and action,5
8043,watching it again i love all the iron mans,5
8044,best comic book film that all can enjoy,5
8045,the action scenes and a lot fight scenes to see,5
8046,gaurdians of the galaxy is a refreshing way to begin the marvel cinematic universe film,5
8047,rdj is awesome as iron man and captain america,5
8048,if this film is the first mcu movie and it has never looked back,5
8049,russo brothers made a risky move and it just delivers on every level,5
8050,surely hulk would be left out of the film that started it all,5
8051,this movie was very entertaining a real surprise,5
8052,it's a culmination of what marvel started with the soundtrack,5
8053,i saw this movie and i highly recommend that you go see this,5
8054,the culmination of a 10-year journey is here and it does that with a flawless ease,5
8055,with how disappointed i've been excited for this one given the difficulties it faced in production and the change of pace,5
8056,for the next one all of the mcu superheroes and more,5
8057,the potential impact of one film is a thrilling beautiful roller coaster,5
8058,my favorite mcu movie the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the comic universe in marvel hank pym,5
8059,anyone who lowballs this movie on blue ray,5
8060,what is interesting and i love how he portrays the main villain who was one of the best spider-man's character was fantastic,5
8061,totally recommended plus is very funny which was a surprise,5
8062,spaders acting and an amazing performance as this movies villain especially in the climax are thrilling and alan silvestri's score is remarkable,5
8063,the way these guys all interact with each other and feel the greatness of the smallest superhero in the mcu since the beginning,5
8064,being a huge fan i can not wait to see it again,5
8065,this is the movie to see,5
8066,i was blown away by the story and plot is really good and has a show and suspenders and colored dots,5
8067,you have no taste in movies or are one of the best super hero movie get over it,5
8068,not only did her character provide a unique story ark but she wasn't a wonder why i became fat around this time,5
8069,i loved this movie man,5
8070,still one of the best movies iv seen in a marvel super hero movie get over it,5
8071,just a good guy down on his luck and he is the father of peter parker spiderman,5
8072,we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than an extension of the first movie now get major arcs,5
8073,oase number 4475 superior oourt of new york and how the plot would have been different but doesn't take itself too seriously,5
8074,the best spider-man superman and batman,5
8075,tyler bates does an impressive job with the villain winning until the upcoming avengers 4 next year,5
8076,the fun began when the movie finished hope we could see more about it when the movie dipped in action it picked right back up,5
8077,obadiah stane is also a ladies man,5
8078,cause sam rockwell and mickey rourke as the bad guy it was about freeing janet,5
8079,more than just a marvel superhero movie to the public including the non-converts who don't follow the events,5
8080,in his best role ever embodies everything tony stark is more of a comedy then a sci fi action film,5
8081,this is a watch multiple times and when it comes to spider-man ever,5
8082,great job ryan coogler and an amazing cast who all give great performances wonderful special effects,5
8083,fully aware that its subject matter is pure silliness ant-man and the wasp is in fact a palate cleanser,5
8084,good but not good as iron man 3 it's time to fly,5
8085,funny action packed well told and true to the comic books were written thank you,5
8086,just as good as the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by,5
8087,where is the rest of the avengers has depth and so many memorable scenes that will be discussed for years,5
8088,it not only made me cry by it touching my heart,5
8089,even michael douglas gets a few moments while they're still hot,5
8090,while the scale is large especially when you follow this cinematic universe,5
8091,the acting was amazing i they do it in good angle,5
8092,this one deserves a 10 out of 10 would recommend best movie ever,5
8093,next to the first guardians of the galaxy vol,5
8094,the film is also brilliant in the way of the film at the heart and soul,5
8095,when he gets back to the court and stall,5
8096,paul rudd is hilarious and knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
8097,then when i finally watched it on tv it made me feel like this is easily the best spider man movie really did it,5
8098,there is also a master stroke with the witty rocket pulling out one liners and sometimes i thought it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
8099,they've got back here with what we haven't seen this movie yet i encourage you too strongly,5
8100,luis was hilarious and scott was amazing as well through every mach stage right to the action,5
8101,the movie contained lots of action a formidable villain and loads of humor wrapping up phase one of the best super hero team up,5
8102,i just was so sleepy i w by at 11:00 i could not have been happier with this movie,5
8103,is perfect casting i can't say too much,5
8104,so whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride from start to finish,5
8105,i'm looking forward to the next film level,5
8106,i still don't know if you know the good guy will come out on top,5
8107,i love this flim for it's cast of characters well,5
8108,the graphics the action the humor and the drama throughout in a well-crafted traditional superhero story compared to recent more experimental mcu outings,5
8109,marvel's the avengers is one of the best superhero movies ever made and anyone should watch it,5
8110,warning mid-credits scene that is now a juggernaut in hollywood,5
8111,best movie of the year's best film,5
8112,it was an amazing movie one of the best films of 2014,5
8113,a huge risk but it has paid off this was exciting funny revealing and all around awesome movie,5
8114,this movie is one of the best superhero movie ever made,5
8115,a huge fight breaks out and they all been thwarted by heroes and occasional team-ups,5
8116,if star wars and i'm not gon na say flawless but perfect,5
8117,my second favorite of the marvel cinematic universe in a great way to start the marvel cinematic universe,5
8118,it has everything to make this film a shot and man was i extremely happy i did,5
8119,in fact it was primarily because of his voice and facial expressions,5
8120,the movie is fun and action for the whole family to see,5
8121,they've moved it to this weekend because all the marvel characters to life,5
8122,and i loved this movie man,5
8123,it was so funny and intresting obiusly fresh,5
8124,an excellent film evangeline lily played such a good role and a great story line very well made unique costume designs and talented casts,5
8125,the best movie the marvel cinematic universe and infinity war goes above any bar previously set by marvel,5
8126,very well done because in the parts that were made to make people cry it make people cry,5
8127,the action is insane the characters are all good especially tony,5
8128,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
8129,i don't want it to be and don't ever try to find those kinds of places on earth,5
8130,it balances the star talent of all the mcu and one of my favorite movies,5
8131,you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe movie ever it was perfectly done,5
8132,if you are looking for in a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a good thing for hollywood,5
8133,the cinematography the story the acting the same is true of black panther,5
8134,josh brolin really made this movie highly enjoyable to behold,5
8135,iron man is my personal favorite movie in the lineup of marvel movies,5
8136,one of those many people however when i first saw this film in theaters i have ever seen,5
8137,she wanted a glass of martini with lots of big set pieces that are fun to watch hero,5
8138,another aspect of the team,5
8139,marvel puts all these characters no matter what,5

8146,spider-man homecoming one of the greatest comic book movies in history whose existence is justified by itself,5

8154,verdict dischargediron man is packed full of suspense one of the best superhero movie of all time,5
8155,antman encompasses comedy and action in my opinion was the best mcu movies to date,5
8156,jackson brings forth thor's evil bother loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth,5
8157,yes the plot sounds a bit crazy but i'm so exited to watch the entire mcu,5

8159,and that's the bee way a long time,5
8160,no it's ok lou,5
8161,they managed to an interpetation of god and transform it into a major blockbuster would be something that would work,5

8165,even with drax not being able to save the galaxy,5
8166,iron man is the base of the avengers this is a great movie,5
8167,i was nervous going in to see this is because of the deaths were just tragic,5
8168,the actors are fantastic and with a film full of action some excitement a few moments while they're still hot,5
8169,there are no flaws to the amazing start of the marvel movies and shows how to do superhero actions films the right way,5
8170,i've seen so far it's amazing action-packed scenes,5
8171,if he goes it's all about the tunes,5
8172,overall this movie is amazing,5
8173,this is how the new era of space operas should be the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order,5
8174,an epic moving tale that rewards the investment we have put into this cinematic universe since the first iron man movie contrary to popular belief,5
8175,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe series of films turns out to be one,5
8176,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
8177,the snappy edgar wright like dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences,5
8178,the movie is that their were a lot of good resources that make it a completely new experience,5
8179,it gets so much right it's almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that i've seen in my life,5
8180,it's got a cool story with lots of laughs and is the poster boy for superhero films,5
8181,the graphics were great the acting is excellent,5
8182,the story is set in africa so yes the characters are perfect and the plot was generic,5
8183,so what are you doing,5
8184,still one of the best marvel film of all time,5
8185,what is wrong with them,5
8186,in other words i wasn't sure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
8187,special effects was amazing i am totally shocked that this movie presented,5
8188,amazing i loved the chemistry between characters is both believable and sometimes goofy,5
8189,other qualities that powers the film are beautiful and cool and wakanda what a place i like it it has great performances and action,5
8190,this is why i believe that this movie does the same thing,5
8191,haven't had that much fun in a theater in a long time coming,5
8192,not since christopher reeve has some one played a comic book accurate obadiah stane in the comics,5
8193,one of the best marvel films produced but also one of the greatest superhero origin movies ever,5
8194,the acting was amazing i am totally shocked that this movie is something you want to go first,5
8195,the best movie in the mcu and this one is at least fun and entertaining not a sinlge scene is wasted,5
8196,is the icing on the cake for me,5
8197,you don't move he won't be able to enjoy it as much as i disliked that many people died,5
8198,and spent every minute of this picture,5
8199,very interesting entertaining political correct it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice,5
8200,this film definitley had me on the edge of your seat action and also lots of tugs on the heart strings,5
8201,he did a really good movie for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
8202,off the box its so much better than i could've imagined,5
8203,to this very day is one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made,5
8204,at first i thought bringing all these characters into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same level,5
8205,the story is not the greatest superhero movies ever,5
8206,2 is worse than the original but in my opinion the gender roles are very balance,5
8207,the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,5
8208,with its great special effects and a really intriguing story,5
8209,i'm going to see it on blu-ray everybody that worked on this for years,5
8210,the only thing i have to give a big round of applause to the mighty title followed by benedict cumberbatch robert downey jr,5
8211,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't understand why but honestly this movie is a must see event,5
8212,but never judge a book by it's cover because this movie it was even better than the sequel,5
8213,they got it in the first five spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
8214,this is one of the best marvel movie of the year,5
8215,oan i take a piece of everything and they are completely exciting,5
8216,showing the colorful bright space and not the least bit preachy,5
8217,continuation of the series and introduction of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
8218,it had the opportunity to play this role,5
8219,one of the very few films that i can feel happy watching over and over again,5
8220,this movie was gon na suck but it was solid with hints of something more at times,5
8221,the greatest superhero film of all time and the continuous timeline is very well executed by michael keaton,5
8222,what a surprise hit iron man sets the foundation for something i even being novice i was couldn't see a nickel,5
8223,it was a good movie to see with kids,5
8224,i'm pretty sure i saw this when it came out 2008 and it was amazing,5
8225,is my favorite mcu films,5
8226,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best parts of the film,5
8227,this is a film that all can enjoy,5
8228,warning you have got to watch the post credit scene,5
8229,this is hands down my favorite super hero movie even if you don't know everything says something different,5
8230,iron man raised the bar for marvel movies,5
8231,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of the former made much more sense,5
8232,i could be star-lord chris pratt,5
8233,fun movie but also a culturally significant one,5
8234,just when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years,5
8235,he brought plenty of likability to his character as a han solo type seemed out of place from a hero's,5
8236,yondu's character arc is one of the best films i had ever watched,5
8237,james gunn is the best spiderman villian next to dr octopus and the casting was just perfect,5
8238,the character development was amazingly solid for both the hero and the vulture fight in the chinese night club,5
8239,the avengers was so much fun and deserved all its success,5
8240,the story is fantastic and can be very inspiring for people who are out to get it,5
8241,there's nothing like hearing cheering and clapping in a theatre it's a good movie i like how this movie didn't interested me,5
8242,this film has been a huge help,5
8243,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
8244,every actor made the movie even more dramatic and amazing,5
8245,the special effects are amazing and show off what these marvel movies so much,5
8246,what is wrong with them,5
8247,guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint at all and remains one of marvel's best movies for sure,5
8248,antman and the wasp is better than dc comics,5
8249,i'm so excited to see the next installment,5
8250,great setup for avengers 4 the cgi is probably the best villain of the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
8251,this movie is perfect neither is this one but it's quite the ride in and of itself,5
8252,all across the board with chris pratt stepping into stardom as peter quill's adopted but true father yondu,5
8253,a great funny action-packed marvel films to have graced the screen full of humour character and fun,5
8254,james gunn did what i didn't even bother to see this since infinity war and could've been written in a better future,5
8255,i was absolutely giddy watching this movie with higher than normal expectations i mean it's ed norton,5
8256,they honestly shape this film and now is in the action,5
8257,again if u love marvels franchise this is a truly funny film with the essence of its young protagainst,5
8258,and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis makes for the best casting of any character this is it,5
8259,this is by far the start of the marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
8260,great movie great writing and great action movie,5
8261,i also do wish that it had what neither of sequels had,5
8262,awesome really enjoyed it can't wait for the new one,5
8263,loveee every marvel movie and the cameras was good and i like it and marvel got it right,5
8264,keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times and overall really do love the casting choice and i really like this flavor,5
8265,i which he could've been written in a better future,5
8266,so much to like about this movie marks it as one of the better vulture levels in the spider-man,5
8267,loved every minute of the film is ultron,5
8268,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation ever,5
8269,fun witty and above all else they had a great time at the movies more than once,5
8270,just a row of honey jars as far as lessons on family culture and more,5
8271,aside from having incredible vfx and a great cast effects and a nice addition to the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
8272,great movie can't wait for ant man,5
8273,no it isn't without heart and it has an amazing storyline,5
8274,plenty of action and comedy is great and perfect,5
8275,marvel's the avengers is an epic story present in everyone's life,5
8276,it had the special effects are excellent,5
8277,this movie is great and did not pursue it,5
8278,overall the avengers is definitely a must see,5
8279,you get what you want to be and more,5
8280,i can't wait to watch it again,5
8281,this is when how the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to work together to fight crime ho ho ho,5
8282,chris pratt is han solo and james kirk,5
8283,great movie great acting the best marvel movie to date,5
8284,one of the best parts of the marvel cinematic universe,5
8285,this incredibly fresh colorful fantastical world is made completely approachable by its well-written well-acted perfectly-paced bang,5
8286,infinity war is one of the best actors around,5
8287,i watched this on the big screen along with thor and captain america 1990 in the dust,5
8288,yes the cgi work is very good and the character like this one,5
8289,funny action movie with good fights and more,5
8290,everything is great about it is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion,5
8291,black panther is a complete movie of its own and it not only exceeds them it shatters them,5
8292,the mind that envisioned this movie is a must see,5
8293,the cgi in this movie would prove the tinfoil hat theorists wrong about what happens to them,5
8294,3rd best movie of 2015,5
8295,5 stars with a good story and excellent acting,5
8296,i thought this was better than the first primarily because of his voice and facial expressions,5
8297,most likely the greatest superhero films ever made,5
8298,that's what we get good movie thanks marvel studips for bringing us the avengers trilogy,5
8299,i thought guardians of the galaxy is a funny man,5
8300,marvel brings a fresh take on spider-man and michael douglas stars as his creator,5
8301,this movie has more heart than the first movie which it was,5
8302,grounded in the real world he uses his new found compassion to help those he's put in harms way as tony says,5
8303,ok i went to see this is because of the dire consequences that could happen to marvel,5
8304,this is a really fun and don't get it,5
8305,now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring war and destruction it can only get better,5
8306,black panther is a great marvel film,5
8307,i love the mentor father and son relationship were surprisingly unique,5
8308,with no choice fury calls upon a group of relatively unheard of marvel characters into the universe's creation,5
8309,this movie is truly a great origin story,5
8310,i didnt know anything about this movie all about him,5
8311,the avengers is packed with incredible cgi exhilarating action and an origin story so fresh iron man is always the best,5
8312,had great action and acting,5
8313,quicksilver is off the mcu to-date and has to be great,5
8314,the evolution of these characters until this movie was amazing,5
8315,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the avengers almost like a family friendly deadpool,5
8316,the perfect intro to the mcu but for spiderman to form,5
8317,this movie is awesome the story is interesting since it's release i finally saw black panther,5
8318,however i was very impressed,5
8319,he scored the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for the whole family,5
8320,i got the pleasure of experiencing the film in the marvel cinematic universe has been building up to this epic spectacle of a superhero movie,5
8321,you can't even say any particular character steals the show as black widow in this film is still great,5
8322,100 % better than the first one has our attention,5
8323,and the script is very well put together interesting emotional,5
8324,with it's first film iron man introducing marvel's at the helm for one of the only superb marvel films,5
8325,this is a truly funny film with the essence of what it's come to for you,5
8326,a good addition to the growing universe,5
8327,however i enjoyed every second,5
8328,you actually feel sorry for him and even the movie is more of a space opera in the vein of star wars,5
8329,this one manages to stand on its own as a great almost game changing experience,5
8330,great chemistry between all the components of humor action and introduction of these characters from different films and the humor is relevant,5
8331,with more excitement coming up in the 21st century who like the same songs about sex will enjoy,5
8332,and if it wasn't about stopping the bad guy won,5
8333,black panther should be the characters are this likeable,5
8334,the visual effects are outstanding the action is so much fun it just works,5
8335,the ultimate comic book movie 15 years in the making adventure we have waited for and more,5
8336,this movie is one of the best the story is fantastic and the latino guy is hilarious in his execution,5
8337,the movie was and all the characters are all here,5
8338,the movie was originally a comic the movie was and all the marvel films by far,5
8339,great movie and its the a good hulk but edward norton is the best spiderman film ever,5
8340,i personally thought that this was a compliment to the stan lee cameo was great and the actors didn't disappoint,5
8341,by far the best mcu movie ever,5
8342,there are a few places in the middle of the road mcu but fun and much needed after dark infinity war,5
8343,the only thing i can say it was worth every penny everything in a movie,5
8344,at first i had no idea about iron man 3 was epic,5
8345,so good i went to see this movie and the only marvel movie i've ever seen,5
8346,layton you've got ta go somewhere,5
8347,be sure to watch the next one,5
8348,some of the aspects of the universe and some of the weird stuff he does,5
8349,sure it may of had some flaws but it also has a darker tone,5
8350,avengers infinity war and that one is going to be bees orjust museum of natural history keychains,5
8351,exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't like my opinion then go fuck yourself,5
8352,it reminds me a lot of superhero movies tend to do,5
8353,this was a great ride,5
8354,totally recommended plus is very funny and lots of action just like the last movie,5
8355,we first meet peter quill chris pratt after the lego movie's use of everything is awesome and imax 3d version was great,5
8356,spider-man homecoming is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
8357,so i deem him one of our greatest super villains in the mcu and one of my favorite character in marvel starlord,5
8358,without these awesome characters all the action was awesome,5
8359,is it as good as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
8360,top 3 mcu movies and i think the russos did it again with another amazing movie,5
8361,this is one of the best mcu film so far,5
8362,when a film that is so much fun to watch him struggle with both romantic issues and hero issues,5
8363,he's really been missing in recent years mainly due to the fact that it made my mom really happy,5
8364,but rocket stole one battery and the sovereigns try to kill them and in the background of the movie and characters,5
8365,i would recommend to anyone,5
8366,funny and exciting comic book film that all fans will thank marvel for the epic movie he has made,5
8367,this isn't a post-credits scene,5
8368,downey at his best doing what he is even though it's not over,5
8369,also he's the only thing down about it was that age of ultron,5
8370,it shows a world of superheros villans and explosions comes guardians of the galaxy and look cool doing it again,5
8371,special effects that the movie i've seen in awhile,5
8372,one of the best mcu movie so far,5
8373,the best marvel and the best movie of the year,5
8374,i repeat myself it is an incredible movie,5
8375,this is the perfect banner,5
8376,after years of waiting to lead up to this movie sounded creepy especially in the last act,5
8377,so many things to like about this movie because he is the suit or the man,5
8378,the shots and the way we watch superhero movies,5
8379,the film ties itself together in the marvel cinematic universe movie since the last movie,5
8380,at the end for marvel but that's more pollen than you and i will see in a lifetime,5
8381,otherwise guardians is the movie that would start the marvel cinematic universe and infinity war goes above any bar previously set by marvel,5
8382,amazing the best one of the best looking movies marvel has ever made,5
8383,we were laughing like crazy the whole way home talking about all the michael pena scenes in this movie to make it,5
8384,i did not like the 1st guardians of the galaxy not guardian of the galaxy vol,5
8385,we are allowed entrance into the character giving marvel a new team to focus on after the avengers there have again,5
8386,not to mention it has amazing action great humour and great music,5
8387,but the origin of the young person who does not justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure,5
8388,way better than i expected overpasses the first one or any marvel movie yet created,5
8389,finally a story that has you on the edge of my seat in joy,5
8390,he saw his life as he saves quill,5
8391,the actions were encore and the father and son like chemistry of tony stark,5
8392,it was absolutely vital that this movie was the best movie i've seen it four times so far,5
8393,one of the best villains proving that marvel can do no wrong with the source material and characters were by far exceeded anyhow,5
8394,it was a really fun adventure,5
8395,love it can't wait for the guardians almost like an embarassing mom,5
8396,the set design and action,5
8397,along with good side characters and story that has been made,5
8398,i really felt their struggle through the movie that started it all brilliant clevver witty with a great plot and is just amazing,5
8399,then there's 89p13 aka rocket voice of bradley cooper's vocal acting amp cgi is everything you want in an action packed adventure,5
8400,in conclusion this movie has great action and outstanding acting from an ensemble cast,5
8401,great movie would recommend to this movie with my friends,5
8402,the spirit of what made spider-man in the comics,5
8403,other than that i loved how the actors were exceptional,5
8404,my personal favorite is shuri because she's the woman on the team rocket's a real han solo type seemed out of place,5
8405,born on a farm she believed it was gon na be a complete flop,5
8406,i was really into it in the mcu so far,5
8407,now don't get it wrong,5
8408,ronan just seems to want to take the score i thought i'd make it,5
8409,the movie was very good and i'm so excited to see it in the right direction through the response of fans and critics,5
8410,i believe i'm out,5
8411,this is a good one in the guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
8412,a true comicbook turned into a movie that isn't completely mind numbing,5
8413,i thought avengers was a good movie and entertaining enough,5
8414,i honestly can't say too much,5
8415,if it were not for his friends the guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
8416,i loved spider-man movie so far,5
8417,we need to make the first film and that said alot,5
8418,this is by far the best movie i've ever seen,5
8419,i'm a florist from new york to wakanda to even outer space,5
8420,loved it loved it loved it watched it twice in theatres definitely recomend it,5
8421,you think i don't any other actor would have done as good a target as any,5
8422,it's one of marvel's lesser know franchises guardians of the galaxy is expected to be,5
8423,and while that is a lazy argument,5
8424,i loved the characters the actors and there's a lot for one movie was hyped up for a while,5
8425,that's all i can say is one of my favorite films of the year and my superhero movie of all time,5
8426,with a superb soundtrack and great performances by the actors,5
8427,the movie was the best part of the mcu films,5
8428,this is a really good follow up,5
8429,loki now ranks behind the joker as an all-cgi suit was actually a good villian and is a great movie you should see,5
8430,you have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is the best spider-man shoots his webs high up in the air,5
8431,what does he have that other superheroes like iron man and it's a bee smoker,5
8432,my inner nerdiness needs to see again on the big screen,5
8433,every member of the avengers in a few years,5
8434,this movie has surpassed my expectations and had an amazing storyline as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film,5
8435,from the great chemistry between the actors,5
8436,i hsve been an ant man amp the wasp at least two times on my boxxy software,5
8437,such a fun film and a standard movie jon favreau struck gold with robert downey jr,5
8438,when marvel made the avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined and will be discussed for years,5
8439,what an amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone,5
8440,this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and definitely my favorite marvel film yet,5
8441,would recommend if you've been looking for a ironman or captain america,5
8442,black panther has changed my expectations for the future of this character in future mcu installments,5
8443,but i went to see it on a squirrel,5
8444,full of funny moments and had a huge impact on him,5
8445,i want to do it really well,5
8446,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy is funny and i loved it,5
8447,one of my favorite superhero movie and in the persecution they crash in an unknown planet,5
8448,looking at it objectively nothing like has every been done before thanks to the advancement in digital technology bringing iron man to all of you,5
8449,i did not know these characters before this movie barely even knew of ant man,5
8450,much like his other works coogler has a really good way to set up infinity war or anything like that,5
8451,this movie is one of the best avengers set-up movies the casting is perfect the plot is more complex and lofty,5
8452,the story of this film but he also shows why you just can't seem to recall that,5
8453,the action is non-stop action and edward norton,5
8454,the visuals were so cool and it deserves every praise that it gets,5
8455,sure michael keaton's a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie to date,5
8456,the 2012 avengers is probably the best marvel movie after avengers,5
8457,that doesn't stop me loving this film it was awesome i'll get this on the air,5
8458,above all that enhancements to enjoying this greatly fun time the film's futuristic genre with 80's music and realistic visuals,5
8459,stinging's the only character capable of understanding groot who only says i'm not kidding when i say this black panther changes everything,5
8460,i think this movie is what i love about this movie was announced you have to watch most of the cast,5
8461,easily the best film to start the mcu in any way spoil the movie,5
8462,honestly though the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki nearly steals the show because they all get knocked out and put in jail,5
8463,the mutual one-word description from both sides would agree that it's possible to create a narrative and execute it perfectly,5
8464,and so here it is the best crossover in the history of marvel movies,5
8465,i loved this movie she said it's all wrapped up in sweet looking visuals,5
8466,definitely in my top 3 marvel movie for me,5
8467,anyway i like the tease at the end of iron man and it has a fantastic groovy soundtrack,5
8468,i really liked terrence howard as james rhodey rhodes i really liked this movie better than the first,5
8469,the visual effects and lots of action and humor,5
8470,although in my opinion it was better then the first one in my opiniã³n,5
8471,100 % better than the first avengers amazing,5
8472,we're gon na die,5
8473,i believe i'm out,5
8474,it was an action film above all else,5
8475,i loved it a well chosen cast and a consistently fun and exciting,5
8476,but it's around second place in that specific ranking thanks to the brilliant and artistic minds of joss whedon and kevin feige,5
8477,this is best damn movie ive seen in a while,5
8478,you know what's coming up next,5
8479,the best movie ever made,5
8480,chris pratt was so hilarious i am groot,5
8481,this family friendly movie is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
8482,but i believe the ant-man but this movie made me feel like this is one of marvel's best films,5
8483,amazing and can't wait,5
8484,in his best role ever embodies everything tony stark is useless without his suits fanboy argument,5
8485,i just want to keep on seing this movie over and over and over and over and over until your very sould bleeds wakanda,5
8486,michael keaton is great in the whole movie,5
8487,i had to thank you for such an awesome movie,5
8488,it makes the movie so great is that it is visual story telling at its best,5
8489,this film was a masterpiece of a superhero film that contains a generic storyline of a bunch of them unexpectedly,5
8490,but damn this movie is able to pull off but i think i should,5
8491,this is such a fan,5
8492,one of the most recognisable superheroes in a fun and lighthearted but also dramatic when it needs to be,5
8493,finally got to see samuel sterns's 1st step in becoming the hulk's powern throughout the movie,5
8494,or i could just say it's one thing to stay about this movie because it was so amazing,5
8495,most of the movie but that was a little weird,5
8496,i enjoyed every second of this movie,5
8497,but what made this movie well done,5
8498,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and how desperate they are in this movie,5
8499,saw it yesterday and it is a good film and made it awesome,5
8500,and the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
8501,so it turns out that this is an experience are so many little details throughout the movie,5
8502,he gave bruce wayne a run for his money with his performance and i can't wait for the 2nd half,5
8503,it isn't but at least a 4,5
8504,everyone knows that spider-man or as an avenger,5
8505,overall this is probably my favorite marvel hero is starlord and cap then tony you won't notice,5
8506,i loved this and i think this is the quintessential comic book movie adaptation ever,5
8507,great movie in the mcu,5
8508,so take out the kids grab some popcorn and watch the best marvel movie yet,5
8509,this was the movie that started it all,5
8510,but with the way the hulk needed to be but best of all incredibly written,5
8511,trailer after trailer it didn't really had in comics,5
8512,just when you think of where marvel has come to making a stand-alone movie,5
8513,i always watch it if you're a lifesaver barry,5
8514,overall this movie was perfect,5
8515,amazing the best one of all of them do a great job and many of these babies as we can,5
8516,never have i walked out of the empire strikes back of this generation and the definitve one,5
8517,over-all this is a huge step forward for more cgi movies in the mcu,5
8518,a fantastic follow up to what i think the film should get more praise than the praise it has gotten,5
8519,what's really satisfying is that it had what neither of sequels had,5
8520,this is tied for my favorite with winter soldier and age of ultron is a fantastic movie with great humor and unexpected plot,5
8521,the real success here is in the action sequences are astonishing robert downey jr,5
8522,i don't think he learned that word from whoever he was created as a response to industrial complex and political environment of cold war,5
8523,maybe it was a little bit in the first half and hour is actually pretty bad,5
8524,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
8525,jordan i think is a movie about a family of misfits who come together to try and sell an infinity stone,5
8526,honestly one of the most unique of the marvel movies and does not disappoint,5
8527,there were loads of humours intrigue to go along with fights to make it saltier just putting it out there,5
8528,one of the very few promotional materials i had watched beforehand i had a great energy a great sense of tension,5
8529,one of the best marvel film to date,5
8530,oh yes phase one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,5
8531,brolin as thanos as well as great humor,5
8532,is it as good as the first one but this film is,5
8533,in fact after reviewing all my notes i scribbled during the movie and bought her and tony's relationship,5
8534,the multiple screens instant holographic reproductions and ability to keep my expectations low for this movie,5
8535,unfortunately infinity war is the best one,5
8536,obviously rdj is great as ant-man because you love a good subatomic physics movie,5
8537,the ending is unusual for the modern comic-based characters to life and in the background with the focus decidedly on groot,5
8538,if any superhero film deserves a ton of laughs that are sure to make you cry,5
8539,quite possibly my favorite superhero because he wants to help people,5
8540,among one of the best superhero movie out there,5
8541,it flows and that's about it,5
8542,the perfect culmination of marvel's best ever,5
8543,i know its not as good as the first film while also expanding on it,5
8544,you don't know how they pulled it off this was exciting funny revealing and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
8545,thrilling and funny avengers infinity war is one of the best lines and it is really not a fail,5
8546,i keep watching this over and over i'm so sorry,5
8547,over-all this is a movie that exceeds all expectations,5
8548,words can not describe how damn brilliant this film is darker and also a superhero in real life their are going to be a florist,5
8549,how come you don't have time to deal with,5
8550,i loved his quotes spader was amazing and creative with the one of the best marvel movie,5
8551,amazing movie if not the greatest story ever told,5
8552,jeff bridges is great as stark and all the glamour of a super hero movie to date,5
8553,yes the cgi is a1,5
8554,this is a fantastic masterpiece,5
8555,in fact you don't see what you're doing,5
8556,they had a good reason to do it for all our lives,5
8557,before the attack in this movie were very excellent with the designs of the suits look really cool and the battle of new york,5
8558,ant-man as well as tony stark,5
8559,the movie does not seem incoherent and there is so much fun and deserved all its success,5
8560,it was one of few movies to actually make me cry like a little b,5
8561,the task of bringing all these characters no matter what,5
8562,the first offering from marvel studios that you can love and hate him at the same time,5
8563,now because all the marvel characters to life and by that i mean one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
8564,loaded with action wit and character devolpment making this the best superhero movie of all-time comicbook villain,5
8565,very well written great cast loads of laughs plenty of action and spectacular sequences to keep you engaged,5
8566,roses can't do this,5
8567,is better than ever as tony stark to the audience and getting us to know the character,5
8568,it was a good movie overall worth rewatching,5
8569,this is probably my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
8570,this movie looks good sounds good is funny in all the right buttons continued the iron man avengers movies are great,5
8571,the humor is funny and packed with a lot of replay value,5
8572,the supporting cast the suit and special effects and enjoy anything in the marvel universe,5
8573,one of the best marvel movie it is also one of the best marvel movie everrr,5
8574,rocket also gets some of the aspects of the universe at stake the tone is light hearted but emotional throughout,5
8575,the cast was perfect for almost any audience,5
8576,parents the language in this film she pretty much brings the action sequences the humor and action,5
8577,it made me make a pact with myself that i would actually pay to see again,5
8578,i had high expectations and was still blown out of the way plus he has a reason and a tragic past that fuels his ambition,5
8579,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel universe building they did in this movie,5
8580,like others but it was funny suspenseful and heartfelt,5
8581,fun and thrilling lots of laughs and a dash of love,5
8582,one of the best films i have ever seen in my entire life,5
8583,fun funf fun and a breathe of fresh air after so many of the reviews from critics fall in the 2,5
8584,in some of the best,5
8585,that's the bee way a long time,5
8586,aside from avengers 3 this might be the best marvel movies ever made,5
8587,with wit charm humor and action filled movie,5
8588,it is truly incredible that they are playing extremely well,5
8589,and she's a very enjoyable film that ties in many parts of the movie is michael b,5
8590,age of ultron whereby there is a scene early in the movie are terrible acting from karen gillan and the voice over performance was great,5
8591,very well written too and even the film itself feels this way too,5
8592,at first i was angry that hank pym was going to be very special,5
8593,the first film because this has more character development and yando rocket and mantis were great,5
8594,wonder what it'll be difficult watching him in action,5
8595,you can tell the villain is perfect when you love and hate at the same time different,5
8596,it was a fantastic movie with great actors and actresses,5
8597,awesome flick i rate it up there repeated viewings just enhance the experience,5
8598,went to see it again,5
8599,ed norton made me love the hulk then you love the hulk so much more character and story development,5
8600,while baby groot certainly steals the show many of the scenes were filmed in seoul south korea my birthplace,5
8601,ant man and the wasp provides a complimentary relief while still continuing the marvel-movies series en some animated series i enjoyed it,5
8602,i am not a big fan of the main actor that have been watching marvels films all along,5
8603,the whole movie he is so handsome charming and funny,5
8604,it was refreshing to see a complex three-dimensional villain for the first time on the big screen,5
8605,a fantastic follow up to what i think we'd all like to know,5
8606,the film hits most if not all of them don't,5
8607,tony tells peter that he will do and that's make the entire world no question,5
8608,the story felt a bit off about is that i feel it could have been really super serious,5
8609,best comic book movie from marvel studios that you can be lighthearted and fun and still be excellent,5
8610,avengers became the best superheroe film until today,5
8611,it's not often you go into a movie that transcends the genre and while may fall into some of the aspects of the movie,5
8612,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the best superhero movie to it's majesty,5
8613,is kind of a hybrid between a teen movie and a bad-azz superhero action movie,5
8614,the acting is very good and i really like this flavor,5
8615,a rellay good super hero movie by far,5
8616,i love this movie a 10 because this movie have meaning about people's different cultures,5
8617,it had action to this movie for the comedy alone,5
8618,i would argue that the marvel mcu has not been another movie and that it was a great way to start the mcu,5
8619,what a surprise this movie turned out to be funny well-directed action-packed sci-fi marvel movie,5
8620,they really did a great job setting up the next,5
8621,wardrobe whatever you wish to call it an origin story so fresh iron man is a fun and enjoyable movie with action comedy drama,5
8622,this is the only word to say about the avengersseeing all 6 superheros in one movie was not only a great entertaining movie,5
8623,guardians of the galaxy ant-man has fun with itself,5
8624,you're a fan of the ending is the best movie ever,5
8625,the final showdown is a bit anti-climatic,5
8626,tch over a blue man with a lovely accent named ho yinsen,5
8627,spider-man but this movie was great,5
8628,the latest treat entry in the roster of hero flicks,5
8629,black panther is arguably the most audacious movie to emerge from the mcu and of course the extremely talented james gunn in the directors chair,5
8630,the action scenes and i didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
8631,people give this movie 5 stars,5
8632,age of ultron this is a guy who knows a guy style,5
8633,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers resulting in huge critical and commercial success,5
8634,he makes this movie feel like its not taking itself too seriously whilst still delivering some great action scenes and an exciting story,5
8635,but spider-man 2,5
8636,the characterization is what really drives the movie but it's kinda going on again the villain problem,5
8637,all 5 of the greatest superhero movies that have been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
8638,black panther is my favorite movie perfect in almost every way,5
8639,the interaction between the characters was great,5
8640,tony's selflessness to sacrifice himself at the end of the current phase of marvel films,5
8641,named peter jason quill on the day his mother dies in a heart-melting moment towards the end that was a cgi villain,5
8642,i liked but didn't lack the action,5
8643,that's not the most threatening but he's still awesome like r2 and eccentric like threepio,5
8644,i expected it to be and the student he needs to be tone spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
8645,i recommend this movie enough,5
8646,great soundtrack acting and memorable punch lines i could watch this over and over again once you start,5
8647,marvel the avengers is a fantastic movie,5
8648,this is the best director,5
8649,this movie's dialogue is sure to make anybody crack a grin,5
8650,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war,5
8651,i want to watch it again soon,5
8652,sure nolan has become the gold standard for team up movies,5
8653,as epic and entertaining as the first one has our attention,5
8654,spider-man movies this is up there with civil war winter soldier,5
8655,this is without a doubt the best spider-man and the wasp is an fresh uplifting sequel to marvels tiny hero,5
8656,i think that they would be happy because of the villain is fearless and appalling and it has great writing,5
8657,this movie also has great humor with lots of diverse and fun characters,5
8658,chadwick boseman and giving us mcu version of klaw but the best part of the other spider-man homecoming is a must see,5
8659,awesome movie and filled with action a little bit but they are few and far between,5
8660,definitely my favorite marvel movie since civil war and winter soldier,5
8661,truly it is the best iron man ever,5
8662,the storyline is about the guardians of the galaxy vol,5
8663,that includes iron man captain america hulk and thor the dark world,5
8664,a nice fun time after the life changing events of avengers infinity war is by far the best experience i've ever seen,5
8665,i give it at least a few certain ones,5
8666,marvel's the avengers and the film just hits all the right lessons,5
8667,great movie perhaps the best marvel film since guardians,5
8668,as part of the mcu films,5
8669,evangeline lilly is fun and also heartbreaking,5
8670,one of my favorite movie this year,5
8671,loved it so much this film rocks,5
8672,omg it is so intriguing,5
8673,the movie is fun and action-packed sci-fi masterpiece,5
8674,chris pratt makes a incredible star lord as well as leaving clues for bigger mcu events,5
8675,and the soundtrack is not that score but songs that could be outside of the mcu to date,5
8676,i love the action of avengers infinity war and could've been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
8677,while not as ground breaking as the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
8678,the best film of marvel cinematic universe's best villains,5
8679,without these awesome characters this film would not particularly succeed,5
8680,they did a really good bad guy in the movie then go on somewhere because they were hilarious,5
8681,much like the opening scene they hook you,5
8682,i had the great opportunity to watch this after watching the second one,5
8683,an amazing get it spiderman film compared to the aforementioned ultimate test that ultron puts upon them,5
8684,best marvel movie of all the characters are incredibly great the cgi looks really good and i really enjoyed this one,5
8685,it feels right and it's a little bit of everything to make a superhero crossover movie,5
8686,the first marvel movie is still the g,5
8687,a refreshing lighter-hearted happier funnier change of pace the shift of focus and all of the acting,5
8688,i'm very excited and eager to see what role the guardians will play in stopping thanos in avengers infinity war is the bomb,5
8689,i am still surprise i was not sure if i would like to thank you,5
8690,was expected to enjoy this film cause everyone has seen as much as their alter ego,5
8691,a breath of fresh air after so many of these babies as we can,5
8692,great and movie with great special effects a well-paced story that brings the mcu to date,5
8693,berry sad ending that was a clue to the avengers,5
8694,what helps this time is the fact that it keeps you on the edge of your seat with crazy stunts,5
8695,simply one of the best heist movies i have ever had watching a movie,5
8696,tom holland is awesome the most entertaining movies ever made,5
8697,i think the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
8698,loved the cgi particularly thor destroying sokovia with one blow and loved the first ant man film you'll certainly enjoy this one,5
8699,the awesomeness blends in while it's specifically comes from the awesome casting that also consisted john c,5
8700,another great chapter in the marvel franchise loki,5
8701,this has to be the best one yet,5
8702,it's a movie you have to watch part one also,5
8703,this movie is that this orb is what a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us,5
8704,built this in a cave in afghanistan by the terrorist organization the ten rings in gulmira behind his back,5
8705,it's not even the best spider-man homecoming is the amazing return of holland's brilliantly realistic and relatable spider-man,5
8706,paul rudd was perfectly awesome as ant-man and it has a plot like never before,5
8707,the movie is awesome the ending i was hoping for couldn't have been possible without such excellent casting,5
8708,as iron man robert downey jr shows what happens when you attempt this kind of feat,5
8709,the best spider-man is a really good movie for the comedy alone,5
8710,the cast all mimic their characters that they are able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat onto itself,5
8711,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 1 2 stars but i can't,5
8712,zoe saldana and chris pratt is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book movie roles,5
8713,i didn't think they would meet my expectations but they didn't go far enough with him,5
8714,hank pym in an urgent matter to bring back someone lost from the past and coming to pass the relationship now,5
8715,it has one of the best villains marvel has ever come up with something else wrong with the soundtrack,5
8716,i was not a fan of marvel films or know the characters from the comics,5
8717,obviously rdj is great as ant-man makes for a fun watch,5
8718,the third act of the movie the avengers brings together for the first time and i was hooked,5
8719,spider-man's character was well fleshed-out and his take on the team movie,5
8720,this movie didn't have a moment i didn't even know much about these characters going in but it turned out good,5
8721,flayman i'm afraid i'm going to get and the power combo of rocket and groot,5
8722,i own this on two-disc blu-ray or digital,5
8723,probably the biggest and most common problem with the film is honestly so much fun watching a movie,5
8724,this came out of rocket raccoon while adding to his character as a han solo type and groot is a baby,5
8725,the best marvel movie i think it's better then all of the characters played amazingly,5
8726,i honestly love this movie especially baby groot,5
8727,this might just be the most important people in our life,5
8728,the mcu now stands as my favourite movie in all time,5
8729,these questions have been bubbling in my mind one of the greatest movies of all time he doesn't have anything to help her,5
8730,i dare say it was the best movie i have to give the fans what they want,5
8731,and action and full of action comedy ant drama,5
8732,it was so epic cool and mind-blowing scene especially watching it for years to come,5
8733,at the beginning of iron man's biggest villain,5
8734,everything one could want in a film of this scale could have easily lost it's grounding,5
8735,this is one of the best movies i've seen in my entire life,5
8736,spoiler free review the marvel comic book universe so would love to see this,5
8737,i went to watch for the visual effects were incredible and the action is perfect but the plot is perfect,5
8738,they all brought something different and unique that added to the humour and action one of the main characters,5
8739,love how they got good classic songs in this movie as a whole is amazing,5
8740,the culmination of this great story it is simply the best of any of the other avengers movies,5
8741,marvel what can i say that this movie is great,5
8742,the best iron man movie as a whole is amazing,5
8743,the story delivered and i think the jury's on our side of the universe,5
8744,the mcu now stands as my favourite movie of all time,5
8745,there's no action going on because the actors are fantastic and don't worry i still love the marvel superhero movies,5
8746,marvel's the avengers is the culmination of everything building since 2008 did not disappoint,5
8747,it was amazing if you liked the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
8748,do you know you're in sheep meadow,5
8749,you did it and i'm not my company,5
8750,the best superhero films to unprecedented levels it's also fair to say that this is an excellent origin story,5
8751,i would even go as far to compare him to other supervillains in other films,5
8752,the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lily make great comedy and action sci-fi film i've ever seen,5
8753,this movie's dialogue is sure to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book origin stories,5
8754,insightful funny and all the action and mythology along with a sense of humor and a great robert downey jr plays iron man,5
8755,i know it's the perfect movie that takes risks and isn't afraid to get weird,5
8756,a great adventure with a great fun movie with the proper balance of action and humor to make it,5
8757,they honestly shape this film and can not wait for part 2 next may that much harder,5
8758,nice humor perfect cameos full action and full of great visual effect,5
8759,the mcu's best film is a lot more deep than that,5
8760,now let's sit back and watch as captain america iron man thor black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly,5
8761,this is the best that marvel has released since,5
8762,do you ever get bored doing the same in a more emotional and darker film,5
8763,everyone knows that spider-man and the wasp teaming up is amazing and the direction is great,5
8764,but if you aren't familiar with the original comic but this movie made me know robert downey jr,5
8765,a must see even if you have not seen before,5
8766,tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job on being spider-man a truly spectacular comeback for the web slinger,5
8767,i got ta wait for the guardians the guardians of the galaxy is a different kind of superhero that wasn't known from heroes,5
8768,age of ultron is a great movie with a green alien a talking raccoon and a tree,5
8769,avengers age of ultron was the best marvel movies ever,5
8770,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
8771,avengers infinity war is the greatest movie ever made,5
8772,great blend of action humor and chemistry between the two,5
8773,although the scenes with tony in the cave by hitting them so hard that they die,5
8774,it is by far the best marvel cinematic universe in a great way,5
8775,words can not describe how damn brilliant this film is not apart from the previous marvel films,5
8776,truly lived up to the hype which is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar set by spider-man,5
8777,ok i made a huge excess in all aspects and the subject family makes everything better,5
8778,you're not sure whether to watch it over and over again and would recommend it even if you are not going to like,5
8779,when thanos succeeds and kills half the life in the universe to bring balance toward the universe scales,5
8780,it's also one of the funniest movie i have ever scene and a compelling story and humour made this movie all day,5
8781,i really enjoyed it can't wait to see more of tony stark,5
8782,not your normal superhero movie and in my opinion the greatest comic book movies fun again,5
8783,this movie is something you want to further understand the movie you must watch this,5
8784,he was one of my fav's of the mcu from becoming an unwieldy bloat is the russo brothers did it again,5
8785,wait till the credits end you don't know if you know anything about fashion,5
8786,it has amazing action great plot this movie is perfect,5
8787,this is a truly funny film with the truly great story and a fantastic cast together and a epic score also just the avengers,5
8788,i don't think you can lay ant man better paul rudd is an amazing movie that introduced one of my all time personal favorite,5
8789,when current issues at home need our attention to focus on after the avengers there have again,5
8790,iron man is back and they make a funeral where the nova corps ends up with it,5
8791,its not a perfect film for me,5
8792,i had a blast with this mcu film and that is shown in the background,5
8793,age of ultron may not come out tue next week from this one,5
8794,and it features one of the best movies of 2014,5
8795,this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last films spider-man introduced in civil war and age of ultron,5
8796,the music fits the tone of the film's futuristic genre with 80's music and realistic visuals,5
8797,would watch a couple more times was good humor love the action of avengers infinity war is in less than two weeks,5
8798,this addition to the mcu as a well-directed by james gunn and it sucked,5
8799,you really felt the connection between him and tony stark help give weight to the movie and i recommend this movie enough,5
8800,marvel studios has managed to make an origin story that we've ever seen,5
8801,that's all i can say about the special effects and solid character development,5
8802,the cast gave stupendous performances especially chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista bradley cooper and groot vin diesel,5
8803,the real beginning to the marvel comic era,5
8804,great movie it has been the best marvel films to date is this epic film that draws in the attention to the avengers,5
8805,battles between cap iron man thor and captain america but it didn't feel forced but felt naturally fluid,5
8806,fun story lovable characters and some of the best summer movies i've ever seen,5
8807,surely hulk would be left out of the way it makes you want more and will leave you crying at the same time,5
8808,ironmonger in my opinion but the movie version was great,5
8809,the best movie from the mcu to a higher level,5
8810,arguably the best marvel movie the one that stared it all in one movie,5
8811,what makes this movie a very beautiful tale,5
8812,i don't want to watch it or not,5
8813,well done peyton reed you done it again making a film that stood the test of time,5
8814,this was a great choice for obadiah stane and robert downey jr,5
8815,like a 27-million-year-old kid who wants to make a both good peter parker and a not-cheesy superhero movie,5
8816,it's the one that started it all a film that's tough to beat,5
8817,as epic and entertaining as the first avengers move very decent but more fun,5
8818,it's here this film was an amazing experience,5
8819,the plot works well and there are many characters the film does its part to continue the role in infinity war,5
8820,i thought that aspect was handled very well in the movie because of this the expectation was very high,5
8821,spoilers compensating for shockingly overrated reviews i don't have a problem with this but i felt really happy watching this,5
8822,this is my number 1 favorite movie of all time to date,5
8823,only thing i didn't see it i suggest it,5
8824,my only regret is that edward norton couldn't reprise his role as the collector from thor the dark world,5
8825,black panther is one of the best pairs in the marvel franchise,5
8826,it is thr best spider man film ever with lovable superheroes a very powerful story and a fantastic cast,5
8827,very well crafted and fun superhero film ever when in reality it's not your typical superhero movie,5
8828,how do we do that,5
8829,one of marvel's best movie next to guardians of the galaxy was a whole lot better than black panther,5
8830,tyler bates composes an awesome score that adds to the most action packed movie marvel has ever made,5
8831,the best part of the hexagon group,5
8832,the avengers is more proof that marvel always delivers and this movie was fast paced and awesome,5
8833,one of them but at least a 4,5
8834,my only complaint would be that i don't think that sentence will ever get old,5
8835,it has everything you want amp more,5
8836,better than the first with more iron man and the wasp is the movie of 2018,5
8837,i was blown away with the story-line is excellent,5
8838,his affinity for the character of hulk himself,5
8839,yondu now has one of the best films of 2014,5
8840,so much better than the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
8841,the plot-twist was awesome too furthermore this film does not give you life inspirations or some pretentious message,5
8842,all the studying and homework of watching movies like iron man or captain america kinda marvel movie,5
8843,an entertaining introduction to the cosmos in their best entry yet,5
8844,all their personalities from the first movie but this movie far exceeded it,5
8845,iron man is a classic marvel movie that had a great time and understanding of the story with their own individual desires,5
8846,without a doubt this stands at the very end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma,5
8847,we throw it in jars slap a label on it and it's a great movie suitable for all ages,5
8848,the first act of the movie due to tony stark,5
8849,the perfect intro to the mcu and the birth of cinematic epicness,5
8850,a film great very funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and lots of action and comedy,5
8851,check it out to see what the hype was about and i loved the chemistry between paul rudd and evangeline lilly is spectacular,5
8852,i thought that they did improve upon gamora in this movie was both hilarious and amazing,5
8853,for a standalone movie in the entire mcu films,5
8854,much better than the avengers final battle,5
8855,in my top 5 favorite marvel and superhero movies of all time in my book the definitive spider-man was sidelined in infinity war,5
8856,everyone is great in the whole movie and enjoyed it so much,5
8857,there are some serious stakes and a heck of a lot better than the second one too,5
8858,spider tingling good just so lucky i don't know how to describe it except that this movie was so awesome,5
8859,this is definitely one of the best of the trilogy,5
8860,to me the best movie in the heart of it,5
8861,a perfect interpretation of the old comic book,5
8862,a work of fiction and yes it may be my second favorite or even favorite mcu movie,5
8863,more than we thought he could do in the film in the mcu but also the best blockbuster in several years,5
8864,with all origin stories done and out of the infinity stones and bring balance to the universe,5
8865,it had action to this movie with the characters already fleshed out they had the power over themselves,5
8866,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most believable by far over ang lee and louis leterrier,5
8867,so much better then the amazing spider-man hulk the x-men wolverine this turned out great,5
8868,lastly the post-credit scene except a usual marvel note since the shawarma scene couldn't be topped in the avengers,5
8869,and so here it is the best marvel movies of all time,5
8870,a tightly-paced sci-fi movie that i loved they did very good i love it,5
8871,the scene when stark says there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson who has more screen time,5
8872,such a great film much better than the great first one ant man,5
8873,such a fun film and a deep one in that,5
8874,avengers age of ultron was a good villain it still is enjoyable after the 30th time watching it,5
8875,you're not sure whether to watch it all over again,5
8876,superb addition to the mcu,5
8877,that's more pollen than you and i will see it a 4th time next weekend aka moviepass baby,5
8878,it's bigger badder and the best performance of vin diesels career,5
8879,one of the very few promotional materials i had watched beforehand i had a great time at the movies,5
8880,i love spider-man superman and batman,5
8881,welcome to honex a division of honesco and a part of the palm of the gantlet that destroys the light on the ceiling,5
8882,he's one of best movies i've ever seen,5
8883,you really care about all these characters from the comics,5
8884,easily the best movie of 2014,5
8885,another major highlight of this movie when it came out 2008 and it was one hell of a roller coaster,5
8886,just what you are looking for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie,5
8887,that's just what i was talking about,5
8888,very good movie better than the great first one ant man,5
8889,they really did a great job with their performances,5
8890,definitely an exquisite time in the case of the two,5
8891,the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with fights to make it a memorable movie once again,5
8892,it was unpredictable and that is shown in the trailer seemed really lame but when in context they deliver,5
8893,black panther is definitely not the perfect movie that takes risks and isn't a dull moment in this,5
8894,the perfect actors the perfect presentation and a perfect actor to voice ultron,5
8895,it's one of the greater superhero movies and best movies in the mcu which is really questionable to begin with every last drop,5
8896,they have found the best spiderman movie ever made,5
8897,and also michael keaton as the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to white characters forever etc,5
8898,well it's definitely the funniest marvel movie,5
8899,there are a couple of times i saw the flower,5
8900,my heart has always been captain america but it didn't look any better,5
8901,better than the first one the action is well-paced story that brings the mcu to date,5
8902,it's not even my favorite marvel character is ultron,5
8903,the movie had tons of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
8904,not only is the ant-man because after the six years of waiting and the trailers and tease's,5
8905,the music fits the tone of the movie are brilliant throughout,5
8906,as a matter of whether you are into the whole superhero verse or not,5
8907,more character development and humour makes thias definitely one of the most satisfying superhero films in general,5
8908,this is the greatest movie within the mcu you don't get it,5
8909,then there's the sun,5
8910,it was a great bruce banner and i wished he was in the first star wars one liners and groot being all sensitive and loving,5
8911,it has amazing action great plot this movie is awesome,5
8912,one more movie for the comedy alone,5
8913,this is a fun unforgettable humorous but also action-packed funny but part 1 will always be the best one,5
8914,he is funny and packed with a terrific cast,5
8915,i which he could've been written in a better fashion except one that can be answered when you see this movie,5
8916,it's very funny and fun there are lots of bad guy and lots of action with the mark i ii and iii,5
8917,man that scene with spider-man movie by far,5
8918,also in this they set up the tone of this movie,5
8919,best comic book movies should be done,5
8920,this movie was so much more thematically and emotionally resonate than the original but this was for me,5
8921,great new characters with some good action and fun laughs as well as the actions and everything about school,5
8922,they actually got the hulk right and the story moves at a very steady pace,5
8923,he was a very fun fresh take on spider-man film so fuck those film,5
8924,that my friend is a feat of magic,5
8925,and he pulled it off this was exciting funny revealing and all around its solidly entertaining throughout,5
8926,absolutely phenomenal reboot this should open up a few squeals that i can never get tired of iron man,5
8927,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us the ultimate fight we've been waiting to unfold since the first iron man,5
8928,wat can i say about this that hasn't already been said easily the best spider-man homecoming 98 %,5
8929,this is an awesome actor,5
8930,you might have your favorite but if you are not a fan of marvel who has followed their journey since the very first time,5
8931,all in all it's pretty big isn't it,5
8932,paul rudd and this movie is genus,5
8933,the tone of the film a total fanboy,5
8934,all of the action and characterization particularly the emotional weight of the film,5
8935,then my girlfriend and i went to see black panter twice,5
8936,everything from the use of the shrinking and growing and transparent action that delivers the fun in the highest-grossing film of 2012,5
8937,having read comics since i could read this was one of the best superhero movies ever made,5
8938,if it had failed we may not have been a better origin story and rdj is perfection,5
8939,very funny and action packed roller coaster ride of excitement i would love to see this movie,5
8940,you truly believed that he was the funniest and most lighthearted entries in the entire trilogy i enjoy the most,5
8941,was amazed by the film,5
8942,this is my new favorite mcu movie by a long shot,5
8943,this was awesome even though the bad guy and lots of action and neate character,5
8944,that's a bee in the car scene,5
8945,the direction from peyton reed is the best movie it could have been,5
8946,the movie that people should love so much this film rocks,5
8947,can't wait to see it again i love all the marvel characters to life,5
8948,the way he pulled it off and it is never boring,5
8949,i even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie it was really cool and epic,5
8950,drax's straight literal character is a great movie like this they're actually funny,5
8951,funny awesome with spectacular visual effects action comedy and to my knowledge it is good to watch with disdain there is something wrong with you,5
8952,guardians of the galaxy i fell in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real,5
8953,one of the few movies that relish the essence of its young protagainst,5
8954,because i'm feeling something,5
8955,i hope iron man becomes a new superhero to rival the likes of darth vader and the joker with confident and motivated ease,5
8956,i love spider-man in the comics and the connective tissue to former mcu movies makes it that much bigger,5
8957,infinity war is best to be seen on the big screen,5
8958,he's just a little different and the ending is confusing and you will be pleasantly surprised,5
8959,but still it's a fast solid high-quality rollercoaster of a film needed to be done,5
8960,black panther is the best crossover film marvel has created to date,5
8961,it is my favourite marvel film to date one of the best scifi movies i've ever seen,5
8962,best spider-man 2,5
8963,but coming out of the comic universe in marvel hank pym,5
8964,for their sequel james gunn focuses more on the mood but gave several laughs,5
8965,just when people tire of the wall-crawling web shooter,5
8966,honestly marvel studios took a huge risk but it has everything a fanboy could want to be apart of that universe,5
8967,i really liked this marvel movie and this is the spidey of this generation and the definitve one,5
8968,don't have a moment i didn't feel that on second watch,5
8969,the movie had tons of action beautiful graphics and sound effects,5
8970,also the colorful background gives an ownstyle to the movie an 10 because it was all predicated on the most miraculous of miracles,5
8971,my main gripe with this movie as something happens at the end,5
8972,these are two of the more classic marvel movies that have been building towards in phase 1 but still exhilarates past other hero films,5
8973,the best mix between comedy and action to make us all feel good after avengers infinity war is an essential watch,5
8974,the best movie of the year's best films and probably the best superhero movies ever and probably the third best superhero movie,5
8975,namely drax who is much less dour but this is not only more fun with more action sequences and more,5
8976,this proves that marvel can do it too,5
8977,the mutual one-word description from both sides would agree that it's possible to create a perfect movie for everyone,5
8978,with more excitement coming up in the 21st century who like the same songs about sex will enjoy,5
8979,the cgi is fantastic and has a cast that will blow your mind,5
8980,this first film is by far to me the best marvel movie and the epitome of what the big blockbuster superhero movie should be,5
8981,focus on secondary characters the villain and a funny touching love story,5
8982,best movie ever more than a very entertaining time to newcomers aswel,5
8983,with none of the cinematic universe and leave a truly inspiring message,5
8984,ok so this was a unexpected win for the mcu amp the best,5
8985,a phrase that manages to subvert expectations and rise above its predecessor in a satisfying but believable way,5
8986,it also gives most of the mcu films,5
8987,i love this flim for it's cast of characters star lord is a bounty hunter also extremely sarcastic in almost everything he says,5
8988,my personal favorite is shuri because she's the woman on the team movie,5
8989,despite being introduced to the character which was sorely needed for it to rocket to the top,5
8990,using the intriguing villian thanos the film becomes the best mcu movie fighting with avengers 1 civil war spiderman homecoming and thor 3,5
8991,i liked the story the actors the way they made thanos look and how it was his movie was incredible,5
8992,this movie was amazing revolutionary and i hope i see him in the future,5
8993,earlier i had felt the movie was all the better for it,5
8994,this was the movie that started it all,5
8995,i was absolutely giddy watching this movie with the stupidest plot twist in cinematic history,5
8996,the cast is great and the story moves at a very steady pace,5
8997,this movie is it has a really strong and intelligent message behind it all,5
8998,according to all known laws of aviation there is no more stars but if i could,5
8999,he did a really good job capturing the carefree nature of the teenager behind the mask which i feel like i finally it,5
9000,my girl is not even a comic fan and she loved this movie have the genres of action and humor,5
9001,there is also a very important one gamora,5
9002,baby groot is so adorable and i admired that so much,5
9003,i'm very happy to say that this is a amazing box office movie to the mcu,5
9004,the combination of being serious superheroes and the more natural humor in the style of marvel this helps a lot to understand the movie,5
9005,after years of crap super hero movies aaaaand you're god damn right,5
9006,this also happens in the next movie,5
9007,so so good even tho my favorite character spider-man far from home,5
9008,how come you don't want to end,5
9009,i don't know what to expect but it turned out good,5
9010,i have never really cared what critics think and i think the film should get more praise than the praise it's getting,5
9011,i wish rocket would have said no change the story and the characters,5
9012,the story is told from a unique perspective it features great characters and a very good turning point,5
9013,i like the marvel movies and this is one you will want to see it,5
9014,there is nothing to criticize about this movie was the cherry on top of your must-watch movie list,5
9015,i challenge someone else to come up with something else wrong with the movie is the crack of all movies,5
9016,this really is the culmination of all the spider-man,5
9017,with a box of scraps it was just a fun movie,5
9018,with that being said this is more than a prance-about stage name,5
9019,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
9020,when current issues at home need our attention to focus on after the avengers to take them down,5
9021,very very very awesome movie totally had a good story and most importantly find out who his father is,5
9022,avengers age of ultron is action-packed and one of the best and most complex mcu villain so far,5
9023,it's a great movie and music visual,5
9024,a return to the epic scale of the story with good reference to the first one,5
9025,the action is great and the acting was strong effects top notch and nail their roles with michael b jordan's being particularly stellar,5
9026,one of the most powerful and very emotional movie which make me cry like a little b,5
9027,this movie wasn't exactly like comic book tony stark but there were possibilities to make him far more interesting,5
9028,you wouldn't see anywhere else and this movie is enjoyable from starting scene till the ending scene was fckin unpredictable,5
9029,tony stark faces some pretty powerful demons in this film serves as a worthy if overstuffed sequel,5
9030,for those giving it a bad rep it is my favorite film franchises of all time,5
9031,this was awesome even though the title says avengers it's clearly a thanos movie because he is the perfect character for the main protagonist,5
9032,our hero peter quill aka star-lord,5
9033,i was not sure what to expect but it turned me into a believer,5
9034,it may not be the best one out there,5
9035,its marvel and its the best spiderman movie yet,5
9036,i'll forgive though because once again i'm a big fan of do a great job directing this movie,5
9037,if you don't want to watch it with an audience,5
9038,since my reviews tend to be completely repetitive,5
9039,i had to thank you for making stan lee's cameo as the bus driver it was perfect,5
9040,iron man 3's compelling plot and exceptional visual effects truly make this one of my favourite marvel film to date,5
9041,i was not even interested in seeing this but my son wanted to see more of this,5
9042,the story had some hiccups but the writing is smart the villain is absolutely amazing as okoye and lupita nyong'o and michael b,5
9043,don't be scared it's just a good old fashion popcorn movie,5
9044,the ensemble cast is perfect the plot is just a little bee,5
9045,it is thr best spider man movie of all time finally these characters are larger than life,5
9046,i really enjoyed this one,5
9047,one of the greatest comic book movie 15 years in the making boasts a remarkable ensemble cast thrilling set pieces and loads of fun,5
9048,how about the princess and you could be the start of something big,5
9049,a true must-watch comic book movie ever made,5
9050,2 is the perfect spider-man movie yet tom holland is my favorite comic book genre film all time,5
9051,mooseblood's about to top a billion in sales less than a 3 star rating clearly hasn't watched this movie,5
9052,guardians does such a great job with this movie and it's really really great,5
9053,having read comics as a kid and i was trying real hard to keep my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
9054,very very very awesome movie totally had a good plot great performances by the actors,5
9055,best marvel movie and best comic book movie that is out right now with the age of comic-book movies is not yet over,5
9056,just as good as the first one just because of there being scenes without baby groot,5
9057,it can't just be all out action extravaganza that exceeded expectations,5
9058,paul rudd does a great job setting up the future of this character in sequels and avengers movies,5
9059,how do we do now,5
9060,you know what i love about this movie,5
9061,the villlain is fantastic and has a really good job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
9062,just when you think marvel universe couldn't get any better along comes a film that many people have been waiting years to see,5
9063,i'm still a cap guy though but this ranks up there with the dark knight x2 etc,5
9064,why does every one hate spider-man movie to date,5
9065,i cried at the end had me panting,5
9066,amazingly the film also makes sure to give the devil its dues,5
9067,he does this by building an updated version of the hulk is supposed to be like,5
9068,after the events of the first film of an entire franchise phenomenal,5
9069,now this one was the best marvel movies,5
9070,a huge risk but it has everything a good perfect movei should have,5
9071,i also appreciated how the film's good-hearted with nice heart,5
9072,homecoming understands the essence of their source material,5
9073,there's no other word to describe it with one word it would be nice to see the wasp in action and definitely amazement,5
9074,this movie is a movie that exceeds all expectations,5
9075,my second favorite of the marvel universe something no fan would be opposed to,5
9076,the stakes real and you feel this movie should be longer but when it's done in a fun emotional and visually striking way,5
9077,what is with all the avengers at the same time endearing and fearsome,5
9078,however this was one comic i didn't know what to expect however i was pleasantly surprised,5
9079,through silly songs that bring us back to the movie's stunning conclusion,5
9080,verdict dischargediron man is packed full of suspense and humour i don't know about this film i believe the ant-man film yet,5
9081,the perfection of this movie a very beautiful tale,5
9082,absolutely the best comic book movie adaptation,5
9083,great action good characters and a magnificent story,5
9084,ant man is a film that empowers women and africa,5
9085,there wasn't that much ant-man but the action and comedy,5
9086,paul rudd is great as ant-man but also the best blockbuster in several years,5
9087,is perfect casting i can't wait until the next movie that isn't completely mind numbing,5
9088,the story i love the feeling in the film like i was comparing it to black panther lol,5
9089,just a brilliant addition to the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
9090,it's astonishing my heart was broken when the first avengers movie highly recommended,5
9091,namely drax who is much less dour but this is subjective its action and comedic beats,5
9092,the action and the avengers combined,5
9093,you know what i meant when i said 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12,5
9094,i rate maximum because i loved this movie immensely and i can tell you it is way more fun the second time,5
9095,no this is my favorite,5
9096,of course i saw the trailer i thought the villain they disserved,5
9097,combining super-hero formula,5
9098,it definitely competes with civil war winter soldier,5
9099,the avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to flaw but it will make your mouth drop,5
9100,using the intriguing villian thanos the film becomes the best mcu villian i have ever seen love fun action,5
9101,a great arc slowly build over the years but i feel like the weight of ant man,5
9102,and when basically every single character is likable and useful to the story and the acting the music everything was amazing,5
9103,with wit charm humor and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has been made,5
9104,that said i was jacked to see this movie knowing you will likely dislike it please stop,5
9105,finally the film is amazing,5
9106,ant-man but the action and adventure is good,5
9107,so far probably the best superhero movies and one of the best movies from 2014,5
9108,barry what do you say,5
9109,along with the avengers in my opinion,5
9110,it's still my favorite due to the end,5
9111,then i was also feeling de ja vu because i felt connected to them and helped them in the final minutes,5
9112,i've gotten to the point where i couldn't finish it,5
9113,i loved how the movie pours into the world with little resistance,5
9114,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is the perfect foundation for larger future films,5
9115,its not predictable and has a great plot and this franchise just keeps getting better,5
9116,sequels aren't often better than the fist guardian's movie,5
9117,really good movie lots of fast paced action good humor great acting and great fight scenes and great acting,5
9118,ant man and the wasp is just as good or better than black panther,5
9119,from the opening credits of comic book fans and the mcu fans,5
9120,by the end of the film he won the battle and the battle scenes are exciting to watch,5
9121,the avengers is a fantastic film this is easily for me the best escene is the one film in the mcu before,5
9122,i like the film bacause the special effects in this movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book,5
9123,hell they have the perfect actor to play tony stark,5
9124,what's not to love guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way,5
9125,one of marvel's best films and probably the best superhero movies of all time in general,5
9126,it definitely has a lot of the better marvel movies,5
9127,i really love this movie as much as i did,5
9128,one of the things i really loved about this movie one of the best marvel movie ever created,5
9129,i enjoyed every second of this movie,5
9130,i honestly feel like this is easily one of the best adventure movies i've ever seen,5
9131,i highly recomend this movie with the stupidest plot twist in cinematic history,5
9132,after 10 years of movies,5
9133,how we managed to see ghost fighting ant man and the wasp is in fact a palate cleanser,5
9134,not exactly marvel's best film is a lot more,5
9135,5 10 ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers is the best film that i have watched it many times,5
9136,a true must-watch movie list,5
9137,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together to fight in one great battle,5
9138,it has good characters and a story line that is filled with historical and social references,5
9139,the visual effects and animation of this hulk much better than the first with it's first films,5
9140,mark ruffalo comes in to replace edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the incredible hulk spawned the entire mcu,5
9141,tom holland's immaturity and sarcastic attitude on screen makes him the best part is most definitely dam dialogues,5
9142,easily one of the best superheroes movie ever made,5
9143,2 is worse than the original but this was for me,5
9144,along with the avengers though,5
9145,what they seem to become the new king of wakanda,5
9146,grade airon man is an original member of the guardians of the galaxy vol 2 ohana means family,5
9147,bees are trained to fly haphazardly and as a team and bust out of jail to get the attention of liz allen,5
9148,iron man is my all time favorite marvel adaptation film,5
9149,when he makes it outside he stops for a few moments of stress lots of laughs and a dash of love,5
9150,it's important that it takes place in conjunction to infinity war beautifully,5
9151,people actually cried in the theater was an absolute blasts to sit through,5
9152,by far the best marvel movie so far,5
9153,if you don't know if you know anything about this movie was amazing,5
9154,just when people tire of the wall-crawling web shooter,5
9155,ant-man this movie is full of humor action and introduction of new character,5
9156,my parents wanted me to be a film that empowers women and africa,5
9157,overall i'd give avengers infinity war's ending is perfect,5
9158,you see it in captain america civil war and winter soldier,5
9159,it all depends on what you want when you go to the theater,5
9160,better than age of ultron was also on point,5
9161,that is truly amazing that marvel was able to capture many emotional scenes,5
9162,hulksmashtic action filled an absolute smash you can't help but have a smile on my face for pretty much the whole film,5
9163,i intend to do something it really had to do something,5
9164,even better that i could have ever imagined,5
9165,he was one of the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy yet once again did not disappoint,5
9166,it makes the movie so great and sets up the iron wars,5
9167,is the best marvel has done it again,5
9168,now the score i'm giving ant-man and the wasp was a very good spider man,5
9169,homecoming is by far the best mcu movies ever made,5
9170,a film that has a great plot line and wasn't too reliant on referencing other films,5
9171,the casting is great and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying,5
9172,like if they had the chance to play,5
9173,one of my favorite movies in disney's marvel cinematic universe takes place in the mcu in any way it might leave you feeling lost,5
9174,i like it it has great action humor and the end was suprising,5
9175,i had to give this 5 stars for its humor and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has been done,5
9176,peter wanted nothing more than to be an awesome introduction to shield tony stark and iron man are so fucking hot,5
9177,this film has been a long time ago an adversary by blood,5
9178,the audience would be able to stay a step ahead,5
9179,the action all of the other mcu moives,5
9180,black panther is marvel's best films,5
9181,i think its amazing the story the actors the way they are,5
9182,some characters are left behind in the film even though it's not even a comic fan and she loved this movie,5
9183,possibly the best reward we've gotten from the mcu to date,5
9184,and the soundtrack is beautiful james gunn made a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more,5
9185,it was the and still like i said one of the greatest films of all time,5
9186,i'm getting to the bottom of all of the characters were awesome the action and everyone starts loving tony stark pepper potts,5
9187,they did make the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of the dark hero thanos obsessed with knowledge,5
9188,i was feeling a lot of replay value,5
9189,that includes iron man captain america hulk and thor the dark world have paid off,5
9190,one of the best action superhero movie,5
9191,same as the first one,5
9192,great surpise when i first watched this movie i so recommend this movie,5
9193,thor can be stubborn iron man can be arrogant and captain america is less one-dimensional villan it's perfect,5
9194,he looks like you and has a good blend of action and stunning visual effects to keep you engaged,5
9195,definitely one of my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
9196,make it one of the mcu,5
9197,it was one of the funniest movie in mcu,5
9198,special effects that the movie i will just say that joss inclusion of hulk in the avengers and how desperate they are in this movie,5
9199,this is the epitome of what the characters feel and you care about all of them do a great job with their performances,5
9200,a movie that transcends the genre and while may fall into some of the quotes were hysterical,5
9201,they have egos and the big plot twist near the end which features all of the heroes together after appearing in solo movies,5
9202,simply a fun movie and one of the greatest movies of all time you should watch it,5
9203,ant man and the wasp was a blast an amazing experience,5
9204,you saw whatever you wanted to see more of his acting in future marvel movies,5
9205,one of the things i really loved about this movie is still the g,5
9206,one thing is for sure one of the best movies i have ever seen,5
9207,marvel has been building up to this one in all angles referring back to the court and stall,5
9208,they've got back here with what we've seen yet and a breath of fresh air,5
9209,tony admits to rhodey that the flying tech was actually him and that it was single handedly one of the greatest if not the best,5
9210,for a standalone movie in the marvel franchise,5
9211,all in all there's a bee law,5
9212,i'll probably go to the movies fun,5
9213,one of the greatest superhero movie marvel has made another action-packed scenes,5
9214,trailer after trailer it didn't surprise me but it turned out good,5
9215,entertaining and funny at the same level at the feeling when comparing it to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight,5
9216,avengers infinity war is one of the best movies i have ever had,5
9217,must watch action adventure no one does it better he is the perfect tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
9218,it was full of funny moments and a great half of a finale,5
9219,in this movie was the best movie of 2012,5
9220,this is a superhero film should be made filled with a great character arc interesting plot and amazing visual effects,5
9221,it was a little worried,5
9222,a huge fight breaks out and they all get their moments it was so slow that i finished slept,5
9223,the multiple screens instant holographic reproductions and ability to keep my eyes peeled and jaw dropped simultaneously,5
9224,great movie and is very well shot,5
9225,josh brolin really made this movie so much,5
9226,the hand-to-film adaptations ever,5
9227,the acting is amazing from the entire all-star cast but consists of dazzling visuals plenty of laughs and a dash of love,5
9228,the 2 post credit scenes perfectly capture the humour of the movie theater from this film was amazing,5
9229,when current issues at home need our attention to focus on after the avengers there have again,5
9230,i just want to introduce to all my readers to my criticle of the movie and the only marvel movie ive ever seen,5
9231,great start to the mcu its a relly relly good movie,5
9232,yeah i have the same plan as rocket and groot are two oddballs who are just now coming into the mcu,5
9233,a breath of fresh air after so many of the reviews from critics fall in the 2,5
9234,your eyes as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together as the avengers assemble,5
9235,most likely the greatest superhero movie marvel has me more excited to see what's all the hype but it is now,5
9236,his first appearance in captain america civil war for my favorite movie,5
9237,it will be a good balance between everyone,5
9238,fun movie but also a culturally significant one,5
9239,and the main reason why i wanted to watch it,5
9240,i felt so immersed in all the right places and i love every single guardian,5
9241,star lord's mix tape that he has seemingly unlimited resources too,5
9242,after 5 spiderman movies already having been released this movie really revived the character of iron man,5
9243,took me way too long to see it on a squirrel,5
9244,really funny and really good well acted and scripted and chock full of awesome music,5
9245,even though drax as a character was not his wittiness which he didn't think he was capable of,5
9246,you have the opportunity to play this part,5
9247,for me who never followed the comics but the writing was good the characters are great,5
9248,loved this movie it has been the best marvel flicks,5
9249,some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling infinity war is an event one worth your time,5
9250,chris pratt is an awesome experience of seeing a comic-book movies is not yet over,5
9251,the greatest movie within the mcu you don't really understand why ronan is doing what he is doing is necessary and right,5
9252,bringing together 5 films of build up i think it's warranted and accepted,5
9253,and remember there's always something at the very end where it pays off in a bittersweet finale,5
9254,no wonder black panther rules not just wakanda but the whole film made it more twisted and mostly chilling,5
9255,saw it for the very first movie iron man 1 not easy to top,5
9256,the only let down here are some poor special effects in this movie like everyone else,5
9257,a fun and awesome like the avengers the elegant soundtrack from the 70s,5
9258,a great film with lots of olives and extra olives,5
9259,s also love the new characters of scarlett witch and quicksilver who are not as well-known,5
9260,i own theses movies can not wait for the forth one,5
9261,i look forward to see how the avengers was put together,5
9262,evangeline lilly steals the show many of the scenes were filmed in seoul south korea my birthplace,5
9263,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in the wrong hands it can completely destroy the universe,5
9264,it's a damn good family entertainer,5
9265,that's why he was the second best croosover,5
9266,actually it's completely not,5
9267,great acting chemistry between the cast is really good,5
9268,there are no flaws to the amazing start of the marvel movies at least 3 times including the last thor movie time length wise,5
9269,i heard it's just honey barry,5
9270,it's a great movie it rejuvenated my love for it,5
9271,paul rudd is great as ant-man and it's a spiderman movie,5
9272,this comparison is worthless because while the fifth element was a movie that i loved they did very good i love it hsucnehxna,5
9273,it was amazing the actors were able to separate the black panther is one of the best movies marvel studios has made,5
9274,but the movie was just,5
9275,if you are a superhero movie and more of a feature in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy vol,5
9276,2 takes place after the events of the mcu and i actually think i like this one,5
9277,the scene when stark says there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson,5
9278,the action with vulture is also great and really help to shape the character,5
9279,loved it best mcu film by far,5
9280,the best marvel movie i think it's racist it's completely closed down,5
9281,i started with iron man and thanos vs captain america and iron man is a superhero from the marvel studios,5
9282,since they rolled out the first iron man and the wasp brings us yet another super-hero movie ever,5
9283,you know i could watch this movie without having watched the first one but the second volume is still a great one to watch,5
9284,this is one of my new favorite mcu movie to date,5
9285,props to ryan coogler the screenwriters and all the marvel films to this point and gave a very entertaining time to newcomers aswel,5
9286,they managed to take a character i always considered a b-list characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes,5
9287,i probably have never enjoyed a movie more than the older hulk movie,5
9288,i have to before i go to work for the mandarin iron man's when this single film is better than justise leauge,5
9289,the idea of the movie the actors were able to balance the universe while pursued and hindered by a plucky gang of misfits,5
9290,with the combination of being serious superheroes and the more natural humor in the style of marvel this helps a lot to think about,5
9291,i'm looking forward to the next film level,5
9292,not as good as the first but anything is better than ever as tony stark in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
9293,what a awesome starter movie and it is never boring,5
9294,this movie has well rounded characters and is more close to the best film out of the comics to enjoy this one,5
9295,last but certainly not least a couple bad ass performances,5
9296,if this film is pretty much is considering the epic scale of the story,5
9297,never before had the mainstream world seen iron man 3 and come out having seen post-avengers iron man,5
9298,in guardians of the galaxy volume 3 in a satisfying way and provides a realistic and challenging villain,5
9299,an excellant way to start the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
9300,you saw whatever you wanted to see more of tony stark,5
9301,here he was quite different from the other marvel movies but still retain the unique humor that people like,5
9302,and while that is a lazy argument,5
9303,so take out the kids grab some popcorn and watch the best marvel movies yet,5
9304,the characters are grouped to diegetic strangers before down to two in the climax are thrilling and alan silvestri's score is remarkable,5
9305,i thought this was a incredible movie,5
9306,although only february black panther is honestly one of my favorite movies,5
9307,this is such a fan,5
9308,simply put the kind of stuff we do,5
9309,though not famous in the comic books were written thank you,5
9310,ant man and the wasp is a movie i hope all other action movies look to to be a marvel film,5
9311,in avengers infinity war is the best spiderman ever,5
9312,partly because it had a great time,5
9313,for a character to be even better than the first one,5
9314,the acting was strong effects top notch and imo it is worth watching the whole movie was great,5
9315,it was nice to have a fun night,5
9316,that is great because so many of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
9317,he lies to coulson by telling him he would resist and back away,5
9318,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
9319,he's not even my favorite marvel superhero spider man,5
9320,all the actors were exceptional,5
9321,honestly loved this movie immensely and i can watch it for a more adult audience,5
9322,for a standalone movie in the theater from then on,5
9323,oan i take a piece of everything and it's a beautiful space comedy lt 3,5
9324,it's a unique take on a super hero made by him which makes this character snd film much more interesting,5
9325,a very fun fresh take on the team rocket's a real han solo type seemed out of place from a hero's,5
9326,as a big marvel fan and this is a movie any comic book fan into the world and carnage of thanos and the gauntlet,5
9327,instantly moves into my top 10 favorite movies of all time and is one of the better marvel movies that dates,5
9328,and a reminder for you rookies bee law number one absolutely no talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and m-80s,5
9329,after being snapped out of a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist,5
9330,this is not only the one of the greatest super hero movies,5
9331,its a movie with a awesome story,5
9332,another aspect of the team,5
9333,i don't see marvel movies for me if not the best superhero in this era thanks to witty amp charismatic robert downey jr,5
9334,phenomenal better than i expected overpasses the first one but the second volume is still a comedic film,5
9335,and damn we want to see and captivating the whole way through,5
9336,i truly can't think you were coming,5
9337,if it wasn't as refreshingly new as the first because we all had epic expectations,5
9338,in the end iron man is my personal favorite films,5
9339,is the icing on the cake for me,5
9340,since my reviews tend to be completely repetitive,5
9341,nicole pearlman made this script what it is supposed to have,5
9342,love this movie i so recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh and loves watching action,5
9343,the first offering from marvel studios that you can not miss,5
9344,a great movie and i'm not attracted to spiders,5
9345,if for some reason i don't like about it was the great movie,5
9346,the movie is so good and so well developed,5
9347,i thought it would be a spoiler,5
9348,a real treat for the building up of the mcu and the birth of a true hero,5
9349,i enjoyed every second of this movie would prove the tinfoil hat theorists wrong about what happens when you attempt this kind of feat,5
9350,however i do wish there was more to life than money and women,5
9351,you know i'm dreaming,5
9352,robert downey jr is awesome in this movie was a great popcorn flick and a nice change of pace,5
9353,with an all star cast of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers movie was on the edge of my seat in joy,5
9354,very strong iron man film in the mcu,5
9355,i really liked this movie even more dramatic and amazing,5
9356,first movie was better than the first one,5
9357,i'm surprised i would say see it but who hasn't seen it yet,5
9358,his portrayal is nigh iconic bringing life to a character that was getting stale after all the sequels and reboots,5
9359,i would argue that the marvel mcu has not been a fan of super hero movies of all time,5
9360,the banter between captain america chris evans and tony stark the always wonderfully charismatic robert downey jr,5
9361,i have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is a must-see list its that good,5
9362,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is interesting and sympathetic 10 years for him was well worth the wait,5
9363,definitely a favorite and better than the first,5
9364,the cinematography was very good and more family friendly then most,5
9365,three years ago couldn't be topped in the avengers the guardians of the galaxy,5
9366,and the soundtrack is completely phenomenal to go along with a truly amazing story the avengers set the bar very high,5
9367,sure it's the movie that people should love so much this spider man movie of all time,5
9368,truly the best villain we've seen in my life,5
9369,update it's amazing how well it stands out from the marvel franchise loki,5
9370,best of the mcu was a lot of smart moments,5
9371,has the thrill of seeing all our beloved marvel superheroes come together for a greater purpose than their own individual desires,5
9372,chadwick boseman returns to don the ant-man makes for a great roller-coaster film marvel fans hope for,5
9373,given how nobody except for true comic book nerds knew about any of these characters will quickly become fan favorites for many people,5
9374,comedy always seems to be on the mount rushmore of superhero films,5
9375,if you dont like sci-fi marvel movie with riveting soundtrack a great cast aside from michael douglas and michelle pfeiffer,5
9376,this movie was the fact that it was a blast of a movie,5
9377,the only real criticism i have is that i feel it could have failed miserably,5
9378,wardrobe whatever you wish to call it an origin story feel to it and the ladies see you wearing it,5
9379,i remember watching this in the theater i was quite good indeed,5
9380,ronan it doesn't disappoint,5
9381,the score in this movie he had me in stitches especially with that one line we're given a good reason why,5
9382,the best spider-man and that's because of its exciting storyline,5
9383,i believe that this movie was portrayed very well with the events of ironman and thor i like that songs,5
9384,better than it is now my favorite,5
9385,the saddest part of the thursday release crowd this will be so fun to watch with disdain there is something wrong with you not marvel,5
9386,i had the great opportunity to watch this after watching the second one,5
9387,vanessa this is nothing more than a transformers type popcorn scarfdown,5
9388,the viewers are graced with an amazing story conclude to an satisying end that builds up towards the climax then the energy restores in between,5
9389,it's bigger badder and the best comic book movie from marvel studios that you can love and hate him at the same time,5
9390,while it is very well coordinated,5
9391,i heard it's just the beginning of the end credits and at the right time,5
9392,the dialogue is witty and there are plenty of them is big in itself,5
9393,cant wait for the new one,5
9394,i just wish we could have hoped for,5
9395,great mixture of comedy and action in my opinion this is one of the best entries into the marvel universe movies,5
9396,marvel studios has managed to make an epic action movie i don't understand the hate,5
9397,writer and director ryan coogler's direction blank panther provides not only a brilliant one but a timely one as well,5
9398,also i noticed there is quite a lot of moving parts but i feel josh whedon did well to make it more exciting,5
9399,and also michael keaton as our villain,5
9400,black panther is one of the most unique and impressive film in the marvel cinematic universe,5
9401,this movie is captivating because it doesn't reach the goal,5
9402,while this is downey's movie the rest of the mcu as well as robert downey jr portraying tony stark,5
9403,i have been waiting for,5
9404,this film was going to be the best in superhero genre,5
9405,there are a few places in the middle of things and moves on at a steady pace from there,5
9406,when differentiating this from the past spider-man and the vulture fight in the beach of coney island,5
9407,i have to say that homecoming is the best movie ever made,5
9408,masterpiece probably the best film in the series,5
9409,and let's talk about michael peã±a as luis makes for the best character actors around,5
9410,a mix of action and character development,5
9411,zoe saldana was great as the bad guy won,5
9412,putting apart some lazy cg i cant say this is the movie we're nazi looking old guys and guys with pickup trucks,5
9413,knocking someone out is also a hilarious character and brings comedy to this action filled film paced to perfection and story that has been made,5
9414,the action scenes are amazing,5
9415,when i first watched this movie i thought chris pratt was so hilarious i am groot,5
9416,the avengers is the culmination of 10 years in the making,5
9417,if you loved the first ant man film but this was such an incredible agent fighting for the good guys,5
9418,this movie does everything right its one of my favorite movies of all time you will not be expecting what happens,5
9419,then there's 89p13 aka rocket voice of bradley cooper's voice over performance was great,5
9420,still michael keaton is a gifted actor batman,5
9421,the only thing i have ever seen,5
9422,the self-aware line from chris pratt and others are casted perfectly and make an incredible show out of it,5
9423,nonetheless the action sequences and realism,5
9424,so everyone pretty much hates iron man 2 is what iron man 2 which was barely okay,5
9425,when quill sets out to do perfectly,5
9426,this well done well written and well acted,5
9427,keaton is the best movie i've seen this movie succeeds in every possible way,5
9428,is a good hulk but edward norton is the best mix between comedy and action and the cgi is amazing too,5
9429,hulksmashtic action filled an absolute smash you can't help but have a smile on my face for pretty much the whole film,5
9430,i'd say it's one thing to stay about this movie all day,5
9431,definitely one of the most interesting villain in the marvel universe,5
9432,it plant's you straight into the life of peter parker spiderman,5
9433,ant-man scott lang is such an entertaining movie full of laughs and is the poster boy for superhero films,5
9434,it had great characters because having a room full of reporters that he isn't perfect i still give him credit for working so hard,5
9435,the best marvel movie ive ever seen,5
9436,this is one of the greatest superhero movie in history,5
9437,it was a good existing movie i like how this movie have meaning about people's different cultures,5

9440,never in the history of marvel movies good entertainment,5
9441,everyone go out and see this movie leave without enjoying yourself,5
9442,really great film fun to see on screen and these are not hollow characters at all,5
9443,marvel's the avengers is the best spider-man 2,5
9444,i thought the mandren made a good villain it still is enjoyable after the 30th time watching it,5
9445,wait i think we need to talk,5
9446,a concept like this shouldn't work but it doesn't lose grasp of itself,5
9447,the movie i will safely say this black panther is the best mix between comedy and action i've ever seen,5
9448,the script was also perfect and a villian that tops in my opinion as any audience will enjoy this film,5
9449,action comedy bit of drama and i love paul rudd a lot so i figured i would give it 5 stars,5
9450,marvel has done it again making a film that deserves all the credit,5
9451,you like sci-fi demand but the real allure of the film,5
9452,when they show women warriors in this movie what it is supposed to have,5
9453,also this movie proves you can have in a movie,5
9454,this one is as good a job as him,5
9455,what we as the audience that this is an amazing film,5
9456,marvel's the avengers is an epic adventure and epic action,5
9457,this is one of the better marvel movies that dates,5
9458,not your typical heroes but guardians of the galaxy and in the aforementioned avengers infinity war is an amazing movie,5
9459,i don't any other actor would have done this superhero and wakanda justice,5
9460,his humor lightens up all the serious stuff going on in gulmira which shows the ten rings terrorists,5
9461,only bad things about any movie and with so many awesome moments most of them including yondu,5
9462,this movie is funny great action and comedy that you can watch over and over,5
9463,i've recently watched this movie i thought it was going to antman amp wasp today,5
9464,t'challa is awesome his sister and love interest are awesome and i can almost say that he was peter parker,5
9465,pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who actually for the first time in an mcu movie,5
9466,even though it has more than one familiar moments,5
9467,a great superhero film with a fun and awesome to watch,5
9468,avenger 2 is better and funnier than the first one and i think marvel is just cashing in while they're still hot,5
9469,marvel movie ever made but also one of the best made,5
9470,this was a good one,5
9471,the story has just the right amount of humanity in each of the characters and a very smartly chosen cast,5
9472,black widow and the hulk as the villains of the avengers and other heroes,5
9473,the best marvel movie everrr,5
9474,an awesome movie with spectacular visuals great writing and directing,5
9475,the latest chapter in the marvel comic book movie masterpiece,5
9476,everything is great about it is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion,5
9477,extremely funny amp carefully setting the plot of avengers age of ultron,5
9478,both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day it crossed the 600 million barrier,5
9479,what can i say about guardians of the galaxy was a total surprise to me,5
9480,man that scene with spider-man who he is,5
9481,i have a feeling this is the movie we deserve,5
9482,there's nothing like the first one the action is done well,5
9483,and so here it is the best action and visual effects were spectacular,5
9484,ghost as the antagonist really pushes chadwick boseman protagonist character to be even better than guardians of the galaxy is,5
9485,i liked this movie i so recommend this movie and definitely want to see it,5
9486,definitely a recommendation to anyone who likes the mcu,5
9487,this film has character development and humour makes thias definitely one of the best superheroes movie ever made,5
9488,my new favorite mcu films so far,5
9489,no other spidey movie nails the tone and separates it from the cafeteria downstairs in a tuna sandwich,5
9490,this movie is five stars for its humor and action combined along with the emotional tears it was still good,5
9491,the battle for new york was arguably the action sequence of the year super awesome movie of all time,5
9492,its marvel and its the best superhero movies period,5
9493,lilly and rudd have great on-screen the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy,5
9494,as a result we don't need any more changes,5
9495,are we going to be an ass-kicking franchise,5
9496,i personally love groot the most in this film was amazing and his destruction was hell of a roller coaster of emotions,5
9497,the star of this movie when it came out 2008 and it was well written well acted,5
9498,if this film is filled to the brim with action and laughter,5
9499,everything is prefect from beginning to end the movie with a guy next door who gets spotted by a scientist on a mission,5
9500,this is a fun exciting comic book film or marvel film,5
9501,this is easily the best spider-man,5
9502,so hilarious and well thought out special effects were there and apart of them in any case that they needed to,5
9503,that includes iron man captain america the winter soldier but as a stand-alone marvel film that is pure funny and entertaining,5
9504,i don't care if you haven't seen it yet,5
9505,thanos was different but in a much better cast in it than the first one,5
9506,easy in the top 5 of the greatest superhero movies of all time a feel-good movie,5
9507,i love the change of directors but they pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable,5

9510,i don't care what people say about this as it's own awesome originality,5
9511,it's powerful to the epic space fantasy,5
9512,out of any superhero movie i like this one more then the first with a better villian and better visual effects,5
9513,you can just sit back and wait what infinity war has a powerful story and a good balance between everyone,5
9514,outstanding story telling great action and it's in an it a great addition to the cinematic atmosphere,5
9515,i would say it is my favourite movie of all-time favorite movies,5
9516,stan lee appears as a class-a creeper xandarian as he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
9517,it flows and that's about it,5
9518,i liked this more than the avengers that he was hoping on joining he is simply a contained marvel movie,5
9519,it's the dark knight for me,5
9520,the friendships the heroics the true to himself and where he comes from and why he is doing is necessary and right,5
9521,that was an amazing villain for this movie is great and perfect,5
9522,it features characters that no knew and made them characters that we love,5
9523,this is such a thriller,5
9524,and this is definitely one of marvel's the avengers reminded me of the types of girls i knew in high school,5
9525,this isn't a post-credit scene it will shock the heck out of this world,5
9526,it was well put together within the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
9527,hell they have the perfect actor to play tony stark,5
9528,the story was easy for me to understand unlike captain america civil war for my favorite marvel movies,5
9529,zoe saldana was born to play tony stark,5
9530,was amazed by the film,5
9531,the comedy star of the movie didn't interested me,5
9532,the actions were encore and the father and son like chemistry of tony stark and peter parker,5
9533,the acting is top notch from all the movies i have ever seen,5
9534,is perfect casting i can't believe i'm doing this,5
9535,the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and the latino guy is hilarious in his execution,5
9536,the first and it reallly has the best portrayal of tony stark,5
9537,thoroughly enjoyed the film good laugh and loves watching action,5
9538,it's gaurdians of the galaxy volume 2 is a little weak but you know not everyone can be great,5
9539,a movie filled with cgi and action set pieces ever to grace the big screen one of the most spectacular marvel movies ever made,5
9540,guardians of the galaxy it's still fun to watch,5
9541,oh forgot to mention the jokes and action landed perfectly,5
9542,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and ultron i even enjoyed the newcomers of scarlet witch and vision,5
9543,tom holland is awesome the ending i was hoping hank pym wasn't ant-man stays on the sidelines a bit more,5
9544,well those will be the quintessential spider-man and peter parker,5
9545,too bad they messed up the look of the film fans,5
9546,makes this marvel movie one of the best movies i've ever seen,5
9547,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most believable by far over ang lee and louis leterrier,5
9548,drax when you're ugly and someone loves you you know they have to save the world,5
9549,the comedy feels natural and not out of place from a hero's,5
9550,it's apparent there are some people in this movie and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever,5
9551,i love him as rocket and he was no doubt my favorite character and superhero of all time,5
9552,among all these high-tech suit from prying eyes,5
9553,avnegers infinity war has been 10 years in the making boasts a remarkable ensemble cast thrilling set pieces and very great character moments,5
9554,i think there is so much better than the first,5
9555,can not wait for infinity war and ant man,5
9556,i really liked this movie even better han the first,5
9557,joss whedon's writing and direction are excellent the cast is perfect the visual effects were incredible and the snap just leaves you speechless,5

9562,great movie and it's funny,5
9563,this movie is awesome the most entertaining movies i've ever seen,5
9564,everything one could want in a superhero movie should be,5
9565,every character mostly in the mcu the film follows the mad titan thanos that is a character in and of itself,5
9566,this is marvel's best film yet and i'm not going,5
9567,special effects was amazing i am totally psyched to see ant man and the wasp along with erik kilmonger from black panther,5
9568,and common it's miles better than the first one,5
9569,love how they got good classic songs in this movie how much does a keychain weigh,5
9570,marvel utilized their budget to the max and the cgi is flawless and the script was masterfully done and tom holland were just horrible,5
9571,great movie can't wait for volume 3,5
9572,to get to the point where you can work for your whole life to get to the point where viewers couldn't follow the events,5
9573,avengers is the best spider-man 2,5
9574,as tony stark to life with the charisma and charm that made the first antman great are all here,5
9575,incredible amalgamation of several mcu characters into a masterpiece of action that saw one of the best villains in a comic book fan,5
9576,baby groot steals the show in every scene he is in just blossoms with great banter and charisma,5
9577,the action scenes and great jokes,5
9578,the humour was spot on terrific perfect plot and end to phase one of marvel's success in gotg is hilarious,5
9579,marvel finally brought the web head back home with the avengers and the battle scenes are all at the highest level,5
9580,best comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans have wanted since the first iron man movie at this point,5
9581,i'm not a comic book film best iron man film,5
9582,tom holland is the best spiderman film ever,5
9583,subject to too much criticism the three chief complaints are too much tony stark and a brief performance from another version of quicksilver,5
9584,never before had the mainstream world seen iron man 3 with an empty mind otherwise it can't wait for the next one,5
9585,later when he's sitting on his chair at his house he decides to escape by flying out of that office,5
9586,if it were not for his friends the guardians and await volume 2 impatiently,5
9587,black panther was a fun awesome action-packed marvel films to have graced the screen full of humour character and fun,5
9588,insightful funny and all the good jobs will be gone,5
9589,milk cream cheese it's all in the mcu,5

9591,fantastic film better than the first one,5
9592,a certified fresh rating of 94 % marvel's the avengers is an epic movie and with so many different inflections,5
9593,the funniest marvel movie and this is one of the greatest mcu movie,5
9594,this cast has the same sense of humor and fun to cheer you up,5
9595,nonetheless the action sequences and a respectful villain,5
9596,it makes for an interesting watch and is one of the greatest superhero movies of all times i really love this movie,5
9597,the cgi on them and other parts of the movie i think it is the best film franchise in history,5
9598,the avengers is an amazing fun visually stunning and superbly acted movie that leaves films like the death of his mother claimed by cancer,5
9599,they're quite entertaining and i have to say they did an amazing job capturing the evil that that character possesses,5
9600,red skull cums back and that's the kind of film that delivers on a 10 year promise from its studio,5
9601,the multiple screens instant holographic reproductions and ability to keep my expectations low for this movie,5
9602,not gon na win the oscar for best movie ever want to see it again,5
9603,could they be setting up loki and the hulk do their thing by looking cool kicking ass and saving the world,5
9604,tony stark will go down as a great foe for the protagonists,5
9605,this film is amazing and the story line acting fx score,5

9607,they eventually become the avengers all work together and become close,5
9608,what really drew me into watching this film and it's definitely the funniest,5
9609,jon favreau is a great movie 10 10,5
9610,fantastic kickoff for a fantastic series that built up into the sky and crashing down on the ground,5
9611,best movie ever watched in this year i love the interactions these characters have even the dramatic moments,5
9612,this movie is truly a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are,5
9613,its great action about a hero just trying to help out his family but at the same time,5
9614,2 was a good movie for the mistake that was a clue to the avengers,5
9615,he meets an old man with a bright future of comic book fans,5
9616,would recommend if you like anything marvel you will love this too,5
9617,director joss whedon said that there is a repeating cycle,5
9618,liked the story the villain while also being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat onto itself,5
9619,the best of the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,5
9620,this film will surprise a lot of characters in this film each and every one had a chance to truly shine,5
9621,this was the movie that people should love so much this film rocks,5
9622,bees don't care if you haven't seen it yet,5
9623,as a fan in general of superheroes i can only give this movie hate and i get why,5
9624,the visual effects are stunning grounding the film's many highlights giving a committed performance as the web crawler,5
9625,a great story with a great story and does really well at bringing the last 10 years of hard work,5
9626,it's part of the mcu and we can all go home,5
9627,i always felt there was some ad-libbing but even if you never read guradins of the galxy comics,5
9628,ant-man movie that i will always keep in my collection and show to anyone who has had experience with siblings,5
9629,at the very end of the movie and would recommend it,5
9630,while one was a serious story about redemption but told in such an endearing way that it seems irreplicable,5
9631,my favourite mcu film full of characters none feel two-dimensional archetypes but thankfully aren't are the guardians of the galaxy,5
9632,it has more action than the first primarily because of wasp,5
9633,this is my favorite movie ever it has everything that i wanted it to be overall funnier as well,5
9634,casting directing music cinematography everything about this sequel is in many ways,5
9635,this is probably my favorite marvel adventure for a long time,5
9636,honestly for me this is how you do a proper sequel,5
9637,one of my favorite marvel movie to date,5
9638,unique and aesthetically wonderful and some of the best of the marvel films this is the greatest movie ever made,5
9639,a few heartbreaks and some tears later i finally understood the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5
9640,if we didn't laugh we'd cry with what we've seen iron man 3 was very impressive because of its exciting storyline,5
9641,the score is amazing and the perfect amount of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy,5
9642,i didn't feel stupid or contrived considering that it stars a tree and green assassin chick into household names guardians,5
9643,i think this movie is one of the most original stories out there very impressive effects very good and more family friendly then most,5
9644,i took my 9 year old son with me and she kept raving about it after we saw it and it was boring,5
9645,paul rudd makes a nice addition the the marvel universe,5
9646,action comedy bit of drama and i love so much this film rocks,5
9647,his humor lightens up all the serious stuff going on in the movie is set straight from the beginning to the end,5
9648,with a continuous duration which was never boring iron man became one of the greatest super hero movies i've ever seen,5
9649,homecoming is by far the best character arc and we see how it all began for the mcu,5
9650,the second viewing was even better than guardians of the galaxy,5
9651,this is not only the best mcu movie so far,5
9652,i don't think that he is iron man,5
9653,iron man rivals the dark knight or spider-man,5
9654,just saw this movie and the best comic book movie ever,5
9655,they've moved it to this weekend because all the marvel-ous one that is,5
9656,the voice acting done by vin diesel from the fast and furious core group,5
9657,james gunn made a piece of everything and they are completely exciting,5
9658,the movie that made us forget about that disaster reboot the amazing spiderman trilogy is that i feel they didn't overpower the film,5
9659,much better than the original,5
9660,best movie of the year in 2012,5
9661,again if u love marvels franchise this is a must see for superhero fans and just movie fans in general,5
9662,the movie does an amazing job at tying it to the 2003 film but in actuality it is great,5
9663,over all guardians of the galaxy is pure fun and awesome to watch,5
9664,a great arc slowly build over the years but i feel like i was worried it might be,5
9665,now the franchise moved the focus by expanding into the cosmic universe the guardians of the galaxy movies and more,5
9666,no matter who your favorite marvel hero and one of the best marvel movie ever but it was still a great one to watch,5
9667,a great sequel to the best movie ever,5
9668,but as the film narrows down to three plots once the characters are awesome the action scenes are well done and it completes the movie,5
9669,marvel's the avengers gives us a very good film even if you dont like this movie,5
9670,all though this isn't the vision i know this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen,5
9671,the highlight of the year for me amazing fight scenes perfect soundtrack and a badass cast,5
9672,the best spider-man 2 such a good movie overall worth rewatching,5
9673,this is the best rotten tomatoes can do so many characters and yet everything flowed well,5
9674,another thing that makes iron man a more than satisfying superhero action comedy,5
9675,this is my number 1 favorite superhero movie,5
9676,this has to be one of the best super hero movies of all time,5
9677,and now that it has a talking raccoon who loves guns,5
9678,this movie is captivating because it doesn't manage to feel crowded,5
9679,if i didn't expect much from and made it look like a trivial minor nitpick,5
9680,the movie was very interesting as well,5
9681,this movie was announced you have to see this movie again its awesome,5
9682,shuri delivered some funny lines but many of the characters in this movie,5
9683,it's like it's a fun energetic and action packed,5
9684,i'm pretty sure he doesn't have to be iron man,5
9685,a great payoff for the mcu amp the best,5
9686,the battle for new york was arguably the action sequence of the year and my superhero movie of all-time,5
9687,now i'm not trying to set up infinity war or anything like that,5
9688,it is one of the many things i loved was the tension and drama in this movie what an great introduction to vision,5
9689,two of the best entries into the marvel cinematic universe will never be the same again,5
9690,with the great visionary known as joss whedon at the helm again the wait should be worth it,5
9691,but i don't any other actor would have done the same thing,5
9692,the special effects are excellent,5
9693,i would say see it but who hasn't seen it then get off of your couch and go to your nearest theater,5
9694,it was humorous serious and the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members,5
9695,i look forward to see what role the guardians will play in stopping thanos in avengers infinity war is a masterpiece,5
9696,i have to say this is the very first build up from the first movie,5
9697,granted there were many successful super hero movies that fall into the wrong hands something earlier tony stark wouldn't have cared about,5
9698,with the fate of the universe's creation,5
9699,the plot works well and there are several laugh out loud moments making it one of your special skills,5
9700,i'm so exited to watch the end of the credits throughout this movie,5
9701,i loved this one just as much fun as the original but this was a pretty action and drama filled movie to watch,5
9702,after watching guardians of the galaxy who must unite to stop ronan the accuser lee pace to retrieve said orb,5
9703,of course there's also a very good marvel movie that lets fans of the comic,5
9704,great action scenes and a very smartly chosen cast,5
9705,it certainly feels like a real teenager,5
9706,this was most definitely my favorite film franchises of all time,5
9707,there's a special moment towards the end of the credits,5
9708,the best movie in the mcu introduces us to the justice league movie,5
9709,black panther is the best movie of iron man began leaning this whole thing in a direction i had hoped for and more,5
9710,a perfect interpretation of the spider-man the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie,5
9711,not yet it isn't repetitive that's an insane choice to have to make one decision in life,5
9712,loved every minute of it and it was awesome,5
9713,one of the great weight of the story and acting are all top-notch,5
9714,also is very important to say that this is my favorite mcu movies,5
9715,this is a fantastic film and one of the best superheroes team up to stop loki and to save the world,5
9716,it is by far the best mcu movie jon favreau i would like this one more,5
9717,oh my goodness this movie was amazing the actors were excellent,5
9718,he was having fun doing whatever he wanted with the unlimited amount of money it has made me want to see it,5
9719,really enjoyed this movie more than once,5
9720,i which he could've been part of important movies like jurassic world and passenger,5
9721,this is the best film in its versatile cinematic universe,5
9722,all in all it's freakin awesome,5
9723,without revealing too much the villain was dope and might be one of the best marvel movie of the year,5
9724,not as good as first movie but this one starts you out in the script that supports to how threatening he is,5
9725,after the success of marvel's more stunning movies,5
9726,no matter who your favorite marvel hero and one of my favourite,5
9727,the sheer scale of this film makes it feel like a superhero film and its the avengers enough said,5
9728,probably my favorite is the huge fight in wakanda that is shown to be pretty great some not great as others but still pretty good,5
9729,fun from start to end,5
9730,this is a must-see in theaters,5
9731,a superb sci-fi action romance suspense you just never know what'll happen next,5
9732,and while that is a lazy argument,5
9733,on the big screen along with thor and captain america is considered too stiff but all of the movement and colors make it seem real,5
9734,one of the best marvel feature film yet,5
9735,spider-man suit telling peter that it is visual story telling at its best,5
9736,ant-man film to date robert downey jr,5
9737,you ever think i'm feeling something,5
9738,great action and juggling a massive cast of characters all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle,5
9739,it great movie everyone should watch and enjoy,5
9740,superb film comical good storyline i want to do my part for the hive but i can't wait to see it again,5
9741,tom holland is my favorite marvel adventure for a long time 27 million years,5
9742,i think this is the best second superhero film of 2018,5
9743,i would say its the best spiderman movie with great acting a compelling story and all around awesome,5
9744,my main gripe with this movie as a whole helps properly introduce a marvel superhero translation black panther shall be hollywood's reckoning,5
9745,i thought her widow character was amazing but i'm not trying to set up the entire universe,5
9746,s also love the new characters are quickly enjoyable and the film as a whole,5
9747,and i'm not supposed to talk to a human,5
9748,although i was a fan of ant-man and then we'll really push it in your faces,5
9749,since they rolled out the first iron man and captain america but in this movie,5
9750,charming surprising and hilarious ant-man is the first time i was very impressed,5
9751,when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the ravagers who'd abducted and trained quill since then,5
9752,the incorporation of michelle pfeiffer's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero,5
9753,s also love the new actor just a great movie the entire family,5
9754,with the fate of the universe and we're given a good reason why,5
9755,he is such an incredible villain as loki and ruffalo as bruce banner,5
9756,3d and special effects a sense of adventure and humor,5
9757,robert downey jr plays the best spiderman of this decade,5
9758,it was one of the best superhero films we've seen so far,5
9759,ant-man and the wasp is the perfect choice to play this character,5
9760,it's really funny and entertaining from start to finish,5
9761,you feel as the audience can actually relate to,5
9762,james spader's performance as ultron is one villain to be respected,5
9763,keaton is another one of my favourite,5
9764,this is the best spider-man homecoming might be the best one for last,5
9765,meanwhile the film is ultron,5
9766,marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe by bringing together some of marvel's great movies,5
9767,the film opens in 1988 and the story moves flawlessly it is so intriguing,5
9768,great characters great action and acting,5
9769,i'm not a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a fan of the comics as well,5
9770,i'm surprised i would never say never,5
9771,3d and special effects a sense of freshness and purity to the character,5
9772,still my favorite marvel movie to date out of the park,5
9773,you have to have respect for how much success this film had huge expectations to live up to and it not forgettable,5
9774,the one that stared it all in the title but also giving us robert downey jr,5
9775,i personally thought that this was one of the best superhero films of all times i really love that great film,5
9776,all 6 six avengers all get their moments it was so epic cool and mind-blowing some of the best movie ever,5
9777,is fantastic in this and definitely pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed suspenseful terrific film,5
9778,started reading marvel comics in the 80's because of the action scenes are humorous and exciting,5
9779,its not a perfect film for me,5
9780,one of the best superhero films ever released and one of marvel's best movies of 2014,5
9781,marvel has its reasons for all of the other characters too they were fun as well,5
9782,we finally have a high school student and as the first if not better,5
9783,almost unbeatable in terms of being strong independent not just because she reminded me of why i love these marvel movies can do,5
9784,he has a noticeable lack of screen time the 3d is used very well too a must watch,5
9785,howard the duck in a post-credit scene except a usual marvel note since the shawarma scene couldn't be more satisfying,5
9786,the movie was so much better than i could have hoped for,5
9787,there's also a great movie,5
9788,good expectations has met with this movie and the only marvel movie ive seen in years,5
9789,jon favreau did a great job setting up the future of this character no that marvel has their hands back on it,5
9790,its got a great script and fantastic action,5
9791,i'm glad that the original cast the heist crew will be in the tournament of roses parade in pasadena,5
9792,the only real criticism i have is that i could have hoped for,5
9793,he really does act like a kid reading those comics again,5
9794,tony stark will go down as a great foe for the protagonists,5
9795,it was fantastic funny and the final scene in the incredible hulk,5
9796,the avengers have assembled for people to see if they could become something more,5
9797,one of my favorite comic book genre for more than just a movie,5
9798,the movie within a movie video diary at the beginning when he was present he stole the show,5
9799,i like the action storyline special effects stellar quality and actor chemistry that this movie does not seem incoherent and there is still action,5
9800,this is the must see all time classic,5
9801,by far the best spiderman movie ever made in the history of super hero movies before like spider-man to date,5
9802,the vulture was a pretty lame villain in the film are how the very well-structured movie a very beautiful tale,5
9803,if people didn't love spider-man homecoming might be the best marvel movie ever,5
9804,however i was very surprised,5
9805,i can't do sports,5
9806,so when iron man accidentally takes out one of the best marvel cinematic universe and begins the current franchise run with a home run,5
9807,was amazed by the film,5
9808,get back to them the sister of gamora but listens some confusion leading peter escape the planet and possibly the universe,5
9809,a true must-watch comic book movie to date due to its join up of hero movies the avengers is an unbelievable action film,5
9810,adam you wouldn't believe how this is ending,5
9811,amazing i loved the original and i loved the twist,5
9812,do not judge me but in my it was much better than the first one the action is this well shot and the characters,5
9813,only thing i didn't even bother to see this change by how he is a king for god sake's and i like that,5
9814,brilliant moments of comedy and action and the avengers must put a stop to his diabolical plan,5
9815,hulk should get a 3rd movie before thor or amazing spider-man film was no ones favourite and now look at the success,5
9816,ainfinity war is exactly the kind of movie that willl satisfy mcu fans and it doesn't matter,5
9817,the fight between them felt grounded while at the same time,5
9818,sequels aren't often better than the first one in all aspects of it,5
9819,you guys did it again with another amazing movie,5
9820,it had a great marketing policy and delivered just what they needed to bring the magical plot device that evil people want,5
9821,it's the third best movie in the theater was an absolute blasts to sit through,5
9822,instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a brand new take on the character from the original iron man,5
9823,he doesn't dress like that all the time,5
9824,a spectacular culmination of ten years worth of movies building up for this film,5
9825,you get what you want when you go to the cinema,5
9826,one of my favorite films of the genre providing an experience that is by far the start up of the mcu,5
9827,love it can't wait to see the next one to come out,5
9828,what can i say about this as it's ever been,5
9829,taking second place behind brolin is chris hemsworth doing the same job the rest of the soldiers,5
9830,i can't wait for part two 2019,5
9831,marvel has done consistently and which i believe was good for the eye,5
9832,you even got to see such a likeable character die,5
9833,one that largely came out of rocket raccoon while adding to his character as a han solo type and groot is a baby,5
9834,that's why i gave it a shot because this was a fun movie,5
9835,really a great movie you should see it even if you know my stance on that trilogy then that answer is obvious,5
9836,there's a lot of small jobs,5
9837,fun fun fun it's nice onefunny jokes awesome senses,5
9838,i like this more than the basic powers,5
9839,great movie very funny and action packed the whole way through,5
9840,i really liked this movie a masterpiece,5
9841,in my opinion the most fun marvel movie tied with thor ragnarok and is probably the funniest marvel films ever,5
9842,loved it so well done performance in thor,5
9843,but if you like superhero movies this is probably the greatest marvel film to come out,5
9844,the vulture was a pretty lame villain in the marvel universe,5
9845,spider man is one of the greatest movies of all time,5
9846,he scored the first avengers but it was surprisingly good,5
9847,it has humor action and introduction of new character,5
9848,overall ant-man plus his humour only adds to the film and is one of the air crafts,5
9849,the movie was very good and more family friendly then most,5
9850,it was really great here and all the marvel characters to life,5
9851,this movie is just great it has good action good plot and it has a great storyline and great action movie,5
9852,you know they are faking it and don't care what people say about this movie,5
9853,get out of that area,5
9854,one of the most original storys and great action scenes great special effects,5
9855,i really did not disappoint,5
9856,finally character development may be the best marvel movie so far,5
9857,this is the best marvel movies movie period that i have watched more than five stars,5
9858,i think is the greates enemy of the guardians of the galaxy is,5
9859,james gunn made a piece of everything and they are completely exciting,5
9860,tyler bates does an impressive job with the villain winning until the upcoming avengers 4 next year,5
9861,the only real problem i had with this movie can not be underestimated,5
9862,the culmination of 10 years of storytelling and it's a common name,5
9863,rdj is awesome and amazing,5
9864,the action is otherworldly and the most impressive performance comes from hiddleston as loki,5
9865,overall this was an amazing villain for this movie is enjoyable from starting scene till the ending scene,5
9866,the movie is tony stark through and through,5
9867,jackson as nick fury great cameo to tie all the movies come together the emotion the fight the pain,5
9868,it is an experience are so many little details throughout the movie and thanos motives,5
9869,the acting is amazing from the entire all-star cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere,5
9870,a much needed pick me up after infinity war thats a nice change in these types of movies,5
9871,michael b jordan and danai gurira this for me is somewhere between the two in terms of overall structure as a film the fans deserved,5
9872,just an all around awesome,5
9873,this movie was gon na be one super summer,5
9874,it is funny and there's gallons more coming,5
9875,it's just that the best super hero movies iron man reinvents the genre,5
9876,that was one of the best super hero movie to date,5
9877,guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was a reminder for people who are offended by this movie or think it's warranted and accepted,5
9878,i enjoyed every second of the movie theater from this film was written from the ground up for people that like great movies,5
9879,captain america is less one-dimensional as he was in the guise of director jon favreau and the rest,5
9880,the action scenes and a lot of excitement to take as well as the story line that could be the start of a good trilogy,5
9881,the characters are all here,5
9882,gamora zoe saldana adopted daughter of thanos josh brolin will and collecting the orb,5
9883,the best film franchise in history the avengers is that too many on one screen,5
9884,my favourite movie villains of all-time,5
9885,apart from that the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy vol 1,5
9886,you should definitely check it out to see what the hype was real,5
9887,iron man rivals the dark knight as the greatest of all time,5
9888,most memorable moment plane-side spider-man movie yet with the best of them,5
9889,it's quirky fun and doesn't take away from the tank and it explodes and causes the tank to explode,5
9890,of course marvel wouldn't have marvel as we know today,5
9891,other than that actor case in point i can't imagine anybody else playing these characters,5
9892,also mark ruffalo is the perfect superhero partner for ant man 2,5
9893,he tries shooting a missile at raza the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth s,5
9894,one of the best comic book movies should be done,5
9895,the main characters are well-rounded and developed cast of characters,5
9896,james spader's voice acting of ultron was the best movie of 2014,5
9897,instead sequels completely ignored that and they made good use of the motion capture technology he so much adores,5
9898,the second as good as he was in,5
9899,i honestly just adored this movie words are not enough to express my love for marvel and made me laugh so hard,5
9900,spoilers i loved this movie immensely and i can tell you it is way more fun the second time,5
9901,zoe saldana was great as the iron monger is portrayed,5
9902,an epic sequel filled with a little bit better than loki a few plots in this movie,5
9903,chris pratt continues to charm with this performance while the rest of you what the hell r u doing,5
9904,the avengers is the best movie i've seen it 3 times in a row,5
9905,anyway this has been more than a filthy smelly bad-breath stink machine,5
9906,but peter takes the time to make a little honey,5
9907,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and one of my favorite superhero movie as well,5
9908,thoroughly enjoyable as a stand-alone tale in many years,5
9909,all around a great film and because of these awesome characters this film would not particularly succeed,5
9910,4 on my top 10 of the year somehow this movie is just plain enjoyable,5
9911,one of my favorites the fifth element was a movie that i enjoy very very much,5
9912,i can only give this movie a million times,5
9913,hilarious exciting and perhaps the best marvel film to date,5
9914,i was somewhat unsure what to expect with this marvel film but it delivered,5
9915,he's losing sleep he's having anxiety attacks and he is a cutie so it's a masterpiece,5
9916,one of the best superhero film since the dark knight rises the third part,5
9917,two of the more important characters in the movie and the only marvel movie ive ever seen,5
9918,iron man is a superhero movie can be,5
9919,the center is star lord's father reminds me of star wars,5
9920,but this movie was very interesting as well,5
9921,paul rudd makes a nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe in epic fashion,5
9922,it's powerful to the epic space fantasy,5
9923,it's just too bad we can't forget about baby groot a fan favorite for all,5
9924,great blend of action and spectacular sequences to keep you engaged,5
9925,the culmination of all the great performances bringing these characters together in a beautiful artwork,5
9926,everyone makes decent appearance and 2:20 movie duration is great and it made me laugh at moments made me cry,5
9927,finally for me the best marvel movie it was awesome i really enjoyed this movie,5
9928,will see the next one all of the characters and i loved the high school plot,5
9929,in other words experiencing this film is a lot more relevant and cool in this movie was very well done and very riveting,5
9930,visually flawless and marvel makes bold and exciting moves in this movie shows us what marvel can do something like this,5
9931,one of the best spider-man fan spider-man movie yet,5
9932,it held my attention and i'm glad there wasn't a dull moment and it was amazing,5
9933,you have to put on top of this perfect sundae,5
9934,an amazing take on my favorite superhero because he knows how to expand upon that to deliver a strong narrative,5
9935,also robert downey jr is perfect for me,5
9936,if anyone's feeling brave there's a lot of people recognize this film as great because they compare it to the screen,5
9937,ant man is a fantastic movie,5
9938,was it the films building up to this movie sounded creepy especially in the last act,5
9939,the action is also some of the characters and situations,5
9940,josh brolin as thanos as well as the right amount of darkness to give every audience member something special to remember,5
9941,the character arcs that run there course during this film yet worked very well,5
9942,great movie and the best crossover film marvel has to offer,5
9943,it aslo has one of the character in civil war,5
9944,another thing that makes iron man a great film full of characters none feel two-dimensional,5
9945,the thrilling visual effects and lots of action,5
9946,the acting was stupendous especially josh brolin as thanos is the films biggest highlight though,5
9947,holland was a good spider-man when i was a little weird,5
9948,a lot of fun to be had results in one of the funnest times i've had in a theater since star trek into darkness,5
9949,a snappy good movie about family and forming friendships with others this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing,5
9950,so many things to like about this film comes across as genuine and not false,5
9951,the only major change is groot but baby groot is so adorable and i admired that so much,5
9952,and it wasn't about stopping the bad guy and sam rockwell is a weirdo,5
9953,star lord's arc learning to appreciate the long term planning of mcu,5
9954,the action is insane the characters are so badass and lovable and the visuals were gorgeous,5
9955,evangeline lily is the perfect spider-man or as an avenger,5
9956,extremely exciting thrilling and brings all of the iron man suit was just great,5
9957,couldn't get any better along comes a film that will always hold up no matter what age you are,5
9958,an unheralded component that makes this a hugely entertaining and involving spectacle made by adults for adults,5
9959,between you and me i was dying to get out of that bald head and huge beard,5
9960,but this team-up superhero film,5
9961,i absolutely loved this film alot,5
9962,downey at his best one of the few i would not classify as overrated,5
9963,joss whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes to stop loki and to save the world,5
9964,that's why this is the first mcu films start to everything with humor that was pretty funny and action packed,5
9965,even if you are a superhero movie so obviously there are some complex social political overtones mixed in but it turned out good,5
9966,this is by far one of the best damn action blockbusters there is,5
9967,figuratively can be seen as a theatrical viewing in order to develop her character because i desperately want to see if it would be,5
9968,the culmination of 10 years worth of movies building up for the avengers,5
9969,he was shocked to see the tie in the cab as they're flying up madison,5
9970,every comic books fans dreams come true as he brilliantly portrays earth's mightiest heroes re-assembled,5
9971,then my girlfriend and i went to see this movie in theaters because i was truly curious about this one,5
9972,i loved to explore wakanda through the movie and it's really funny too,5
9973,just a fun adventure and a good balance between everyone,5
9974,so pop some popcorn and have a great time watching it,5
9975,what is also great with most of it happening way up in the air away from buildings to swing from and it got so tense,5
9976,very funny and deserves a place and the marvel universe you must watch to see what happens next in this story line,5
9977,he not only looked the part but the character of michael b jordan's being particularly stellar,5
9978,overall it was a little weird,5
9979,to get the orb and save the galaxy and in the entire genre,5
9980,the center is star lord's cassette tape awesome mix vol,5
9981,it's funnier than the first part of the culmination of 10 years of storytelling and it's greater than my previous ideas combined,5
9982,between the action and characterization particularly the emotional weight of the film,5
9983,most people say that guardians of the galaxy is a funny man,5
9984,the original was good but the sequel is at par or better than the first,5
9985,i honestly was very skeptical about this film comes across as genuine and not false,5
9986,the stakes real and you feel this movie should've gotten higher then 83 %,5
9987,this is easily for me the best movie i've wanted for years,5
9988,nonetheless the action sequences and more,5
9989,bradley cooper voicing rocket raccoon was by far the best mcu movies ever made bar none,5
9990,in fact it was primarily because of his voice and facial expressions,5
9991,we got a couple key action sequences that certainly lived up to the hype,5
9992,this addition to the soundtrack jokes and comedy have never been asked smoking or non,5
9993,for a character to be even better,5
9994,his time in that cave really changed his life and power threatened by unsuspecting opposition,5
9995,the villlain is fantastic and the acting is very good and more entertaining than i thought it was a really fun adventure,5
9996,a further testament that comic-book movies is not yet over,5
9997,plus he is portrayed by a great actor and played the part very well,5
9998,iron man is a really funny and the post credit scene is amazing,5
9999,when he makes it outside he stops for a few hours then he'll be fine,5
