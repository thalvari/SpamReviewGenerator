3,i have a rinke black iphone 5 it's a very nice quality set of screwdrivers,5
4,last week i tested this with classical music first because the only other difference between the two easily,5
5,cons that it could easily be tucked into the glovebox,5
6,the one drawback was that it was cheaper to buy the android version all of that went out the day,5
7,i have dropped my phone and i feel like so light the case with the phone case in the description and i bought from amazon,5
8,i'm very happy with a tpu cover,5
9,also unlike the s9 it doesn't have a lot of fall and will protect it from surface scratches,5
10,all in all i'm very glad i didn't even need to read the instructions,5
11,tool set the two blue tools for lifting flex cables and such this is your color and style of uag,5
12,the 34 most helpful review 34 has great info about the park and on her bike and it holds my licence a bank card,5
13,it took a while 3-4 feet on concrete,5
14,sounds perfecthonestly this is probably the best one,5
15,this hasn't been run over by the other reviewer stated the pen seems to not catch finger grease on the screen from scratches,5
16,perhaps it is luck of the draw with friends and i rock,5
17,i was so excited when i ordered it for my spouses works phone fell apart,5
18,great quality have bought other battery brands before with varying degrees of battery power so it will work great,5
19,and yes they fit exactly as the pic,5
20,looks and fit good with my white iphone,5
21,-colors aren't as nice,5
22,it's easy to put on and take off very stylish and everyone loves the experience of the user,5
23,to sum it up you will have an otter box,5
24,the best quality you will fine in an apple product that it is done,5
25,i do not get confused since this one can be used to clean the screen with velcro,5
26,all in all these accessories numerous times and has been a skinomi screen protector is great,5
27,although my old rubbery otterbox case for the phone to accommodate any sitting position,5
28,i suspect it might pick up pocket lint and has a delightful blue light,5
29,apparently when the phone is not for you,5
30,so this was great for me because i use wireless headphones for long periods of time or even a jacket pocket,5
31,good product and it is a perfect case for you,5
32,viewed other reviews and i love it it takes part of the otterbox,5
33,that was my own iphone to test this,5
34,to test it's claim to fame of the noise assassin as advertised in the picture,5
35,may be because of the lack of nfc,5
36,have to replace it because i wanted something i could actually plug in every night,5
37,i would recommend this case to someone looking for a dual capacity wall charger,5
38,works when plugged in and charging out,5
39,so i've already had several compliments and solid fit,5
40,i previously tried theiottie windshield dashboard car mount holder for more then 4hrs throughout the day,5
41,great universal car mount and definitely recommend this and buy again,5
42,i almost want to get it or not,5
43,bondi is a simple case or sleeve included with this holster,5
44,i like the black cord but it picked up the phone,5
45,it's not very intrusive,5
46,i get so many compliments when i have to admit it's quite a bit cheaper but it's amazingly fast,5
47,i'm going to change screen protectors to lift up the guard use the sticky tape either,5
48,i use this as a joke sort of and apps games capability,5
49,only complaint is that i can't alter the dashboard in a rental car,5
50,i have not had a single issue with it i haven't submerged it with my htc evo,5
51,when i carry this in my tub first i didnt try the usb port,5
52,but if you have your contacts backed up in your gmail account so your pc is updated too,5
53,the best part is that it spares your phone's battery was nearly full,5
54,the top slot is for apple's headphones,5
55,it lasted a long time with your cable,5
56,i used them to go on my galaxy note ii and this case helps protect it too,5
57,i did the other and maybe more,5
58,isnt too rubbery or hard feeling and doesnt make it bulky but it still works,5
59,they've quickly become my primary means of charging in the car,5
60,just recieved and it works well just like using a new rubber on it the way i like it,5
61,note i bought a pack of three and and the cell phone i always charge the battery before you apply it,5
62,all indications are that this is a awesome charger its fast the cherger is what i found,5
63,no more 34 i need my phone or tab is dead,5
64,in the end i think will last longer when not using flash the pictures come out great with not so much,5
65,so i got a clear protector bc i ruined mine by trying to jam a paper match stick in the hole,5
66,the phone snaps right in super easy,5
67,while it dwarfs the smarphones that its made to protect your bike's paint,5
68,this is a beautiful one,5
69,turn the shaft clockwise and a little less than the ones that use bulky proprietary cables,5
70,worked great and the fact that you can change them and get information,5
71,lastly is the inner hard case with screen protector,5
72,in terms of hardware and moto droid razr maxx hd,5
73,home button wasn't even empty,5
74,love the case especially out,5
75,the nj speeds were about 4-5 hours and talk time is left,5
76,loves the style and rugged features of this type and it has held up very well,5
77,so i decided to 34 test fit 34 the protector,5
78,it came to me empty,5
79,if you're just looking to purchase another one,5
80,plus my kids have tablets and phones i have lg f6 with case on it,5
81,fm radio wrds and transmitter nowadays it's hard to know since knockoffs can be so useful,5
82,ive had family members and they both could care less about voice that says connected,5
83,to charge the device at the same time or a blackberry bold 9000,5
84,such convenience such ease to usethis adapter besides being built well and works perfectly on an evo 3d,5
85,once assembled the corners of your phone call while listening to audio and video goes through my receiver and onto the road,5
86,i got 6 products from this one vendor,5
87,this is by far the smallest and most compact for being capable of supporting my tab 3 and note 8,5
88,the range is as good and even goes on flawlessly,5
89,it has other interesting features that make it feel overally bulky but still provide a good mix of low bass,5
90,swap out pix when you want to use this qi-charger,5
91,this is my second case for a night,5
92,this will protect it from getting tangled,5
93,an ac wall charger or i suppose cash drivers license etc,5
94,been using this car charger also and it performs quite well via the 2,5
95,it was nice and steamy to minimize dust on your screen you had best apply this in a recent trip to disney,5
96,so when it came to taking some really nice photos in both normal and in 3d,5
97,even though the headset can be paired with a tablet and about 20 ft,5
98,it fits my phone very very well,5
99,i purchased this because i have come across and there is a little shorter but i knew that before buying,5
100,some people complain about the price and this phone does every thing i needed to eject a cd,5
101,it fits the samsung galaxy express is the biggest phone in the pocket,5
102,the item looks great and feels great especially on the road,5
103,i just love my new case it's simple and slick,5
104,for comparison galaxy s4 has 5 hd super amoled 1920 x 1080 at 30 frames per second versus the hd 1080p 24 fps mode,5
105,as a final note i have a extender,5
106,all far easier than using a cord,5
107,for me it fits nicely in small spaces but unlike many of my friends have this same gel feeling,5
108,i have several different colors and i'm happy with it,5
109,it has just enough friction to assure a long service life,5
110,this is one more feature that was not bad either,5
111,let's be honest here we all purchased the iphone 4s,5
112,if you're going at least in my part of the glass,5
113,i didn't keep me from having to buy a thicker case though,5
114,my conversations come through perfectly to others,5
115,i gave it to a friend who has nothing but great things to say about this combo,5
116,it fits perfect in a transparent purple,5
117,glad i bought this hoping it would be,5
118,the charger cord headphone plug camera lens and flash are perfect,5
119,absolutely recomend this phone is no exception,5
120,the air also creates a cushion and pads the phone inside the case with older samsung phones,5
121,it will pair with it turns itself back on a beach chair etc,5
122,but that is expected since it is silicon but it hugs your iphone giving the illusion of zoom,5
123,when you unpack the romoss from the small opening of the ear button,5
124,the top and can sometimes get into,5
125,i have two sons in there early 20's and this was worked just right for cell phone repair,5
126,i have been putting it through the hook where it attaches to the base by sliding on in one shot,5
127,the zerolemon note iii battery gives me the freedom to plug my phone into discovery mode,5
128,a list of some other slim cases i'm returning to it next week,5
129,it appears to be of the same exact part,5
130,for using a smartphone to make calls disconnect or change volume,5
131,also i've read the negative reviews but after having no problems with the dock,5
132,product arrived quickly and it fit just fine,5
133,just know it's working out absolutely great,5
134,not the best quality panel in terms of using it,5
135,i just can't listen to the music on your phone i don't text much,5
136,the trent limir stylus is slightly larger than other similarly priced portable speakers,5
137,the magnet clip with it's charging,5
138,i absolutely love my new case i had dunked my iphone 3,5
139,i could see is maybe the perfect item to get and keep in mind that nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for symbian,5
140,i purchased the aduro membrane screen protector amazon gp product b008gmz734 ref oh details o01 s00 i02,5
141,they fit comfortably in your pocket and not look bulky with the otter-box level protection but it keeps scratches away from the microphone,5
142,the sound quality ease of use is great,5
143,my guesstimate on that trip but i will survive,5
144,save yourself and the seller even sent a cute little magnet with it,5
145,it isn't bulky and charging happens at a pretty good value since you get 3 ear speakers of different sizes,5
146,cheap enough to not be able to receive a text message,5
147,only drawback is that it very easy to understand and use,5
148,the material seems rather cheap but it doesn't interfere with the swipe,5
149,i spent quite a lot of money down the drain on fancier looking units i've hadthe cable is more durable than the add stated,5
150,it fits perfectly with the home button this little app launches,5
151,i have been a better time,5
152,one end of which as a fan of the minimalistic design makes it easy to operate with just one hand,5
153,althought i wish the velcro covered more of the screen and applied bubble free,5
154,the charger works with my iphone 4 charges on the market second to only spigen's ultra optics screen protectors,5
155,nice to have with me on an all day affair,5
156,this product helped me to use it even after a few cycles,5
157,suddenly i was back to normal,5
158,i was expecting to be extremely handy for going to a replacement phone and it worked,5
159,this is one of the lucky ones,5
160,srs 2530847011 ie utf8 qid 1366035045 sr 8-3 keywords note 3 charger,5
161,the colors are not displayed as sharp on my galaxy s3 without having to pickup the phone to release from the holster,5
162,bought three of these currently being used to take a screen capture rather than pull out the phone,5
163,use this with a t-mobile thenovatel mifi 2200 mobile wi-fi 7 hours of talk time,5
164,i use it for all phone functions,5
165,ordered this otterbox case that has lots of 5 star rating,5
166,she has an iphone and 2 of these for a present,5
167,it had great capacity for charging phones and other electronic devices to be able to charge your device,5
168,best otterbox case for mine which fits the hyperion upright charging stand when the spacer is removed,5
169,my wife loves this case so much,5
170,with its rather futuristic shape and variety of colors isn't to big of a deal at 50 here on amazaon,5
171,i do realize it is a little inconvenient to hold and unlike the photo,5
172,but even though i was provided with a review of anker astro 3e and a full view of the world,5
173,finally has handy built-in captive flat cable,5
174,the only problem well not a problem even for heavy mobiles,5
175,i was about to return the old unit but it's an extremely hard green plastic shell for the iphone 5,5
176,duracell is far more comfortable and enjoyable,5
177,not like the other cheaper brand i had ordered great price perfect fit,5
178,bought this case is great,5
179,1a 1a portable charger is a great case and it has some grip and protection for my sg4,5
180,there is also a reassuring click properly positioned openings for sensors and front facing camera,5
181,overall i give this product 5 stars because it is more weighty than it's phone capabilities,5
182,i believe it is as pictured and as described,5
183,does what all these reviews have been written by the same manufacturer,5
184,the bottom of the phone itself and looks very good on the phone or lightly using it,5
185,i would hop online and it's just like an otterbox but it only really works properly with my iphone,5
186,i have used one to charge your 1,5
187,you can slip it in the video to place the charger receptacle on the gps on my phone for a couple days after ordering,5
188,snaps to together and comes apart but once i cleaned it with windex,5
189,they are a little better then the otter box,5
190,one-handed touchscreen action where you stretch your thumb across the screen and won't smudge the bottom side of the case,5
191,sure in android you can get the battery to in between 10 20 % then let it charge in my purse and at my computer,5
192,while these wouldn't be surprised that i did,5
193,working on your car and you relatives too,5
194,phone fits perfect and is working inside my house,5
195,this brand is starting to change colors of the case,5
196,external pocket is handy for me in the comment if they're are more products available for purchase at amazon,5
197,but i'll continue to use this charger to get it,5
198,easy to change phones about every 6 months to write this review from amazon,5
199,just the feel of the phone are easy to use,5
200,also the hear hook can be adjusted left or right,5
201,these are fantastic on the iphones of adults in their lives,5
202,concept is one thing that surprised me with it needed it yet,5
203,i didn't want to break your fragile iphone then don't get tired of them,5
204,unlike other cars where the cigarette lighter that this charger comes with indicator lights to show the correct way and give it a try,5
205,so i like having an extra usb connector your device already has controls and i didn't quite fit,5
206,i've also noticed that when my local phone store sells a similar style of case to me,5
207,my recommendation would be the limited selection of apps available yet who cares,5
208,it has a blue power-on volume camera bottoms rather than cut out,5
209,after my motorola hx550 headset just quit on me after using it for emails and calls,5
210,its nice to have while in the car and it's very light and cheap cons doubles the thickness of the phone,5
211,simple to attach to your phone while it's plugged in and supplied enough juice to charge or run the battery down more quickly,5
212,love it and to my phone i love the color and quality of product and the shipping was great,5
213,it has a rubber lining and it has worked wonderfully as a space saver but a life saver,5
214,very cheap a good case outter surface scratches fairly easily but this should be the case for 3,5
215,the leather ear loops are optional as are the fin-thing but aparently it's crucial to a good friend,5
216,battery life on this thing isn't jammed in my ear good length cord,5
217,this has a great idea,5
218,overall what i wanted it and i will probably order one more of these,5
219,i have run into many times where i'm either outside or in a car crash a couple days dooming myself to a scratched screen,5
220,anyway onto more of the phone itself,5
221,it covers the top portion as a gopole,5
222,they used it until i get a new one that came with it though,5
223,95 rubberized case with a non-bb piece of gear on it to get here but it is very easy to use,5
224,it appears to be a 2 piece case you install on your droidrazr lapdocks change from something that has power passthru,5
225,this battery lasts about 3,5
226,with a white plastic with metal hinges and threads and they need a 2,5
227,doesn't slide out of your pocket or jacket,5
228,it will provide great protection between the hard and shell cases,5
229,around the back of the van when we need to charge their phone the rubber does,5
230,i use this mount for a while now and it still had some juice left in my ipad,5
231,first time buying from caseology and ended up getting an apple branded wall charger and wake up,5
232,really like the firmness of the material and design changes make for a very long time to charge ze iphone,5
233,that's my own fault and certainly could have been a few days,5
234,i'm not sure if i can find that often are loose in the cigarette lighter socket and once there it stays in place,5
235,bass out of the box it comes packaged very well,5
236,love the case overall works great to protect iphone 5s keeping the back of your phone,5
237,android os i hate the otter cases,5
238,11 but i had the back on the evo i did not want to use the phone with the extended battery case,5
239,looks like aluminium but its plastic i thought it would be and my phone goes through,5
240,works well enough and its held up well in the house i was still able to slide it into my powered speakers,5
241,while it does look nice on your screen and they are nice looking dual port car charger,5
242,i have had my galaxy s3 and i can see myself getting tired of surprise postage amounts that are twice or three times,5
243,i have no idea if it will fit my phone,5
244,any change i will update this review if there are lemons out there but does just fine,5
245,before i start i am so it takes up to twelve feet,5
246,the screens are even more convenient than having to remove the phone from the dead in under an hour it was at 100 %,5
247,this case has just enough of the chrome paint coming off,5
248,wasn't positive about it fitting my us cellular s4 but it was not prime it arrived in a retail store,5
249,i worried that it may have worked if it had a lot of the shiny reflective surface,5
250,it's handy size and comes with a mesh carry pouch,5
251,folks have even asked her for hers she screams noooooooo,5
252,i seem to get them was november 8,5
253,to use this case for my new dream phone,5
254,people i am calling hears me better than on my desk in the car,5
255,i am looking to getting a 34 universal 34,5
256,plus you can buy new ones and have bubble spots,5
257,i figured if i could,5
258,despites i drop my phone off the counter and the light show is included,5
259,did not see any difference to everyone else,5
260,nokia makes transferring everything from an mp3 player as a twitter client etc,5
261,so still five stars even without prompting from the company about it they are well protective,5
262,looks great on my white iphone 4s and an mp3 player and listen to movies music youtube or whatever,5
263,i've used maybe 10 or so keys on each row,5
264,the fact that it did not stretch out but the original lightning cable that works great in this category,5
265,there are two things to charge each mobile device on each port you will be happy to know that case does not collect fingerprints,5
266,the protector is i am very satisfied with the shipping it is an awesome unit,5
267,internet radio is not as heavy as other cases,5
268,enter the new trent imp1000 is significantly better than my dedicated plantronics discovery 975 for a while,5
269,what i do with the otterbox defender series will protect against most drops,5
270,i was nervous to order this based on ap's recommendation,5
271,i could focus the camera with a lot of background noise,5
272,boosts the life of the battery pack as shown below 1 led on 1 % charge increase data cable 2,5
273,those sockets works well and us designed not to be missed on the dna,5
274,it is sleek and very nice piece of art,5
275,compared with all of our vehicles and one for inside,5
276,when you flip the lever,5
277,the bubbles are easy to apply to my iphone 2 years ago,5
278,i was a big help in assisting me with my iphone 5,5
279,it does not lag and everything runs smooth as silk,5
280,now i don't work right yet,5
281,ok so initially i was skeptical but it works for 30 why pay more for the gf,5
282,amazon does carry the replacement batteries have been as good or better than the old one did,5
283,i get a card to make it through the day,5
284,my only gripe would be that sometimes i will tap it and it works well and has the benefit of this headset,5
285,you can recharge a iphone 4 not 5 which i own and those things work gr8,5
286,very thin but still offers protection for the phone,5
287,if you're taking a picture in an image editing program,5
288,i recommend this item it is exactly what it is supposed to do,5
289,a qi charging plate and a good price,5
290,worth every cent and then more than that,5
291,plus it's screen protection and card-carrying convenience at a great price and a great price,5
292,it last the whole day and night,5
293,the best part you can listen to any kind of carrying case,5
294,beware the white one works and this does it perfectly,5
295,i drive an older not so smart phones they were well packaged,5
296,i usually go thru 2 each time because i am completely okay with thecolor,5
297,the navy blue looks great on my samsung galaxy s3 since the undercarriage of the slider and easy to use,5
298,i was provided a review sample prove all claims true,5
299,so this device is getting a product and getting it for,5
300,he seems to like it love it love it i use it also with no problems at all,5
301,good price good quality and serves its purpose,5
302,i reluctantly went to the beach and i left it that way,5
303,ive had the cable and carrying bag it came with its own screen protector rather to all of you minimalist out there,5
304,only problem is i'm telling you best-of-the-box things that's ok most of the competition,5
305,and i got to use the powerpak under outdoor conditions the design is quite nice,5
306,but keep in mind i currently own an iphone ipod touch,5
307,the other finally arrived and it was all muffled and now with my new iphone 5s color choices,5
308,his phone still looks very nice,5
309,im happy with the flip cover,5
310,i like that it also protects your phone and want to know why to buy this one,5
311,the jawbone is a great solution to having visibly of my phone is protected against most any fall,5
312,the black case might be better in this price range,5
313,clear sound on both talk and music comes through smoothy and has a raised edge,5
314,this case os as close to ideal as i'm concerned,5
315,i doubt that i will lose my grip,5
316,glad i jumped on it,5
317,it's not a solid case when i have used it too often i need to tape over,5
318,the port on your phone,5
319,i keep my phone in a normal position is almost impossible,5
320,this case is a lightweight,5
321,just say open weather and my dvp shows me the date time screen at all you really need water resistance,5
322,when i did a crazy amount of research before purchasing got down to it,5
323,i've been using it for when im on my ballistic,5
324,the case is that it adds a little thickness to it,5
325,my wife was very glad i did,5
326,i can't tell the difference between this and the noisehush nx70-11825 to increase my battery life,5
327,i didn't worry at all about the size of the samsung galaxy s3 phone,5
328,i can answer the phone remotely works with this handset in the us you can purchase for you phone,5
329,1 strange thing that again is nothing but when you get a lot to say about this product so cute and great to hold,5
330,it looks really professional and does not add size or weight to the ipad or fire,5
331,it appears solidly built and i am using with my kyocera event onto the phone,5
332,i tested yubi power yp250ablu 2500mah ultra compact power bank the same high output,5
333,the e72 is the replacement of cell phone products i own,5
334,i use the slim-line for the same capacity,5
335,once on the bathroom tile floor and replacement s3 plus 100,5
336,while this case won't touch a surface while facedown dust can get inside,5
337,but then again you get used to them,5
338,-dual port allows user to see the fibers from the microfiber cloth,5
339,at a 1 % boost in battery life,5
340,i needed a cover for the front of the keyboard and veiwing of webpages and apps,5
341,bought it for my galaxy tablet twice and my kindle fire,5
342,good flexible case no problem for me,5
343,and this thing charged it up slipped in my consumer cellular sim card and do the job really well,5
344,at first i have become an essential item for the price my mother paid for hers,5
345,for one thing it's that both the phone and the conversations are all integrated into one list very handy,5
346,i stole and idea from the lg headset as i've tested nfc and it works great,5
347,important this case may seem larger than most of the dust off the screen and it tracks 2 steps,5
348,mainly though i bought it or there were some more vibrant colors better contrast and whiter whites and blacker blacks than my ipad,5
349,additionally if your screen has more than paid for itself,5
350,i will buy this brand for my apple products five stars for how well the scratches show what the buttons do,5
351,no i believe it is more than 45 degrees,5
352,i wanted something to protect the galaxy siii,5
353,the moshi headset looks like an high end aftermarket phone case,5
354,plus it provides some shock absorption,5
355,the phone recognize it as a mini-usb cable your phone will be protected against water the s5 has gorilla glass 2 anyway,5
356,and i'd probably do better to check styli with narrower tips,5
357,i like the case it feels great and secure,5
358,it is so nice that i can my new wiqiqi wireless charger with nfc google wallet capabilities all around great product,5
359,if you use the phone just wish i had this bolse 4 port wall charger and car charger and my iphone,5
360,the screen protector and just pull the cord from the first time i installed it,5
361,now that's not a big deal since i don't want their souls to be powerful,5
362,very protective without adding too much bulk it added to the phone and i feel a little more time to larger devices such as ipads,5
363,bought this to go with this one we used worked now i just grab a pair you won't lose it,5
364,without this case my friend is really happy with the phone potentially allowing dust and dirt out of earjack,5
365,my iphone was easy to use,5
366,you may purchase this card directly from my iphone and watching netflix to pass the full required voltage to each device,5
367,i picked up at the edges from possible moisture and dirt,5
368,i'd recommend these headphones for the last keeps its charge well between uses,5
369,the last port is for charging es with the tools,5
370,note the product was mounted,5
371,another use is to mount it to my visual need,5
372,i purchased this product in order to hook it up to about a third my normal speed so far,5
373,once paired to the device i used before,5
374,i was leery about buying another for back up,5
375,but it looks like a cheap pen,5
376,i do recommend you but something else,5
377,i love the option to choose from so how do i talk on tough calls and this is a great product,5
378,only criticism it is clearly very well made,5
379,i see many one or two of no use,5
380,i have used for iphone 4s users,5
381,same as the captivate and the infuse so it's horizontal or vertical belt or strap,5
382,the protective film still on4 without taking the whole mount off though that as mentioned isn't difficult to put on and feel strange,5
383,i responded that the box has a digital display of the iphone,5
384,34 the audio quality for both music or hand-free phone calls especially while driving,5
385,it should charge a little slower than samsung's attempt at control the phone is unlocked as described and in perfect shape,5
386,seems sturdy and very bright since it uses the same kind,5
387,universal size for any phone that uses micro usb then plug another cell or laptop or i can use the headset when driving,5
388,it is totally interchangeable with my other ones the charging prongs that fold up into a very well designed and effective smartphone dashboard mount,5

394,i am able to pack it for air travel and they're really solid devices overall,5
395,nokia for free and i'll review later,5
396,5 screen is just more worth it to keep my iphone going,5
397,once i downloaded the isync plug from nokia website and seems that has become a very big bonus,5
398,after trying to do that yet but they are far superior to the small size and convenience of a longer cable that negates this problem,5
399,9670 summary whether you pick the correct one for your iphone to stay in place comfortably,5
400,haven't tested the microphone speakerphone combo works but that's the nature of wireless charging is coolest most convenient way to charge,5
401,this power bank which makes it look like they were custom molded for me,5
402,he says he doesn't like a case that is thinner,5
403,this is a great value at this price and specs,5
404,change the color of my phone without being overly thick and is easy to install and works great,5
405,looks like it would protect my investment,5
406,the buttons on the left are actually easier to slide on and off and it is still going strong,5
407,6ghz z2560 dual-core snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will pretty much stay static neither increasing or decreasing,5
408,we have a spare or replacement these are the first part of this 3 item,5
409,this is as advertised and had no issue at all,5
410,the case shell that snaps onto the inner part that holds the phone securely,5
411,neither one interfere with the use of the quad-core snapdragon cpu,5
412,there are two micro very very small bubbles for almost two months now,5
413,you plug its power cord is wide enough to clip onto most anything,5
414,the rubber part on your phone for the price,5
415,this is a faster phone in my hand and the price,5
416,it is absolutely invisible and adds no bulk to the appearance of your screen,5
417,was looking for a well crafted product well thought out and well worth the money,5
418,this is a great brand and i charme with this case,5
419,i bought a black one to replace this part so make sure you don't damage your phone,5
420,it also comes with a charger and or micro usb cable,5
421,an adapter for my nexus 10 pulls more than about,5
422,my solution was to place the metal plate to my actual phone,5
423,i can't complain would order another when i put it in the street and suffered no damage,5
424,installation pretty easy and stay comfortably in my small purse,5
425,not all chargers are the fastest cheapest usb chargers and so far have not needed to use one or she wears this one out,5
426,they do the job however it fits perfectly,5
427,the fit is snug plus the connector size fits my phone perfectly and it's a galaxy nexus case,5
428,i did not get scratched,5
429,and will have the reassurance of a 6 month warranty but the manufacturer claimed to have gotten much better,5
430,the logitech p710e mobile speakerphone is very powerful mobile machine that runs on your phone or tablet,5
431,this cover fits the ipad mini in the ipad port,5
432,and btw the case ships from china so it doesn't have a case on your iphone battery level indicator,5
433,this item will charge two devices at once,5
434,this frees you from having to get up in the windshield especially at night,5
435,it's more sticky than traditional suction cups but this one is the looks of the phone itself,5
436,and most of the competitors which kept the display skin from sticking to my ipad and nexus 7,5
437,my wife has been using all the features of it are great as i hoped,5
438,after a lot of extra room on my desk,5
439,the way the back looks and feels cheaply made and always needed to be pushed out of the box,5
440,two things i don't know what they're getting as birthday gifts,5
441,shipping was on time as described and was very impressed by the sound this system produces is on par with the sensor area cut out,5
442,this one is so easy to set up your own mix or go with theirs and then download to listen offline,5
443,the only ones i've had nokia lumia 920 earlier this year i love it,5
444,the device is a little less flimsy,5
445,if you have a screen protector that i have been using this speaker in my htc incredible,5
446,0 model because i wanted to offer a warranty just as good as ones you pay lots of for great quality,5
447,the anker accompanied this feat without a hitch and was listening to the feedback complaints from their users,5
448,now i bought it about 3 times,5
449,i doubt you'll think the charger i have ever owned,5
450,permits rapid entry and no more airplane mode,5
451,the only down fall is the case you need to have a constant wifi connection,5
452,yes i recommend it wholeheartedly,5
453,pros the case is smooth and flawless,5
454,i've tested this battery pack with my co worker order this item and this company,5
455,it arrived extremely fast and in perfect condition for the next phone,5
456,it fits the phone great i can flip the cover insert the battery and the compliance or non compliance to standards for safe levels,5
457,edit changing from a 3 story drop but it feels smooth except where they have the lowest prices,5
458,dont get into it such as the halo screen protector for your note ii,5
459,i could barely even tell there's a battery eater,5
460,what is there to protect you must remove your silicone skin and a harder plastic,5
461,will order again from this seller's customer service,5
462,it broke right away after using the iphone 4 and 4s,5
463,i have an iphone 4s and portable battery solution into one,5
464,i had no issues with the cutouts and button locations are so convenient,5
465,i highly suggest it more then the original apple battery and this one is set up nicely with a satisfying click,5
466,the only issue i have and will continue to pay for it's small enough that it goes on well dissolves the air bubbles,5
467,i bought one for my personal discomfort with a large screen it is not written in the description wasn't very long in one day,5
468,they use their lifeproof case with them so i thought the case was very bulky,5
469,this particular screen protector is also very well done and place,5
470,verizon was selling this last years model at an excellent position for your hand and provides an 18 month warranty,5
471,i had so many complaints on it and dried like that,5
472,works really good the anti glare screen,5
473,i tested the wifi at my local sprint store for her evo 4 g with no jitters,5
474,i have not heard any complaints about it,5
475,treble is smooth a little rolled off but does not come with the battery pack in almost the same phone,5
476,not a big deal but it is still going strong,5
477,photo 2 shows the top of the battery is still working and has power,5
478,because they always seem to fall out on accident,5
479,at home at work and home and need a wireless connection,5
480,those oils get in the way a little kid and i get a new flip cover case with wallet,5
481,i wanted to have something to pass the time,5
482,however i use this to listen to music or have it ccidentally slip out of your pocket w o issue,5
483,i'm also concerned that it wouldn't move easily as it did when my htc evo 4 g or wifi,5
484,who should passif you're just now getting with the iphone in the case and now the jabra bt5020,5
485,bought this with a blackberry bold 9900 9930,5
486,the ports are clearly labeled for charging a smartphone kindle fire and it's still an oem quality cable at a very affordable price,5
487,i am going to have a piece of plastic,5
488,so to recap htc now has the two usb ports are in use,5
489,came just in time for her birthday for her 5s she absolutely loves it and now she has her phone with itunes,5
490,these are as resistent as any other electronics you might by on sale,5
491,i find that it's a quick on the 2,5
492,you didn't want to position before you remove the layer w tab 1 as you install,5
493,i actually like that as the battery that help seat the battery into thinking there's a seam on this phone all the way,5
494,i haven't found a headset that sat securely on my belt in a ugandan forest,5
495,the mount also uninstalls in another 5 seconds and it settles at 4,5
496,at a very speedy 1 hour and it was shown without any protection for the front,5
497,the ips makes it so i can see that it is moving to adopt the hands-free headset,5
498,it is a tight fit and they have been the icing on the cake,5
499,this is a very high quality unit owned almost a yr still works great and i couldn't purchase from somewhere else,5
500,5 feet glad i had it professionally installed,5
501,i never mentioned that i was right she loves it,5
502,this is a softer tan leather look and performs beautifully,5
503,it still works fine with the iphone 5 including the cheap 30 dollar or less charging cases which do not offer proper protection,5
504,something i did not notice this too much and has served its purpose well as a specific 30 pin adaptor would allow lightning charging,5
505,but i had to do it right,5
506,i was a bit hesitant about getting a couple of times so i thought i would take quite a while to charge,5
507,charging is standard for most devices overallthis usb charger charges efficiently and perfectly2 ipad air ipad 2 ipad samsung galaxy note 2,5
508,get these belkin cables and you should adjust your expectations based solely on the pocket would at least provide some notification that i'm connected,5
509,got this for my daughter's case use the same application or if i have any lint in my pockets i wear skinny jeans,5
510,it's easy to take on and off but the phone was unharmed,5
511,i am learning it is convenient for use at any time,5
512,i used this converter to turn the charger so they don't scratch my case,5
513,larger cases works better than other cheap pens,5
514,quality appears to be well made thus far,5
515,we have used about 5 different bluetooth headsets from many brands,5
516,without moving my phone or ipod but the higher amp chargers for the truck,5
517,a set of 3 and they fitted well and was a big win if the dock was function properly,5
518,this screen protector that even covered the home button it keeps all our idevices charged,5
519,third connecting it to a friend,5
520,give me another number so that i've had this now for several months i already purchased a couple of days later,5
521,it took long but i can lol,5
522,i do not want to bring a separate cable that plugs into the wall,5
523,it is the best screen protector i will buy more from this company,5
524,would recommend if you want some fun to your phone make sure to order from microsoft,5
525,i emailed jaybird customer service i received,5
526,if you need something smaller,5
527,hold down the power button cutout because they make the protection for the iphone,5
528,it does not wiggle but still is a mighty fine case and exactly what i was looking for cases,5
529,i paid a little extra protection,5
530,i am in california when it was time to replace it sooner rather than later,5
531,after reading the brief three lines of instructions the manual gave were undecipherable,5
532,water resistant and shockproof and though it is quite portable and simple in design and craftsmanship,5
533,i don't have a prong that goes into your phone,5
534,you can't lay your phone in my office where i can live with at this price i give 5 stars,5
535,i use the seidio dilex holster case,5
536,i however don't get me wrong i'm not even mad about it,5
537,i needed a case from the mall forever,5
538,connectivity nokia phones have unique features that distinguish it from its plastic underside,5
539,just as good as an otter box you dont necessarily expect them to become natural feeling,5
540,at a cost of less than good sound seems to be built of sturdier plastic,5
541,4a doesn't blow it's fuse easily hasn't happened again and i recommend this to anyone,5
542,regarding the gorilla glass but the back wasn't doing it,5
543,they stay very firmly in the plug behind my nightstand and run the wires under the floor mats so they don't crack the screen,5
544,exactly as the picture snaps on and is made of aluminum tubing so they're pretty fragile,5
545,nothing for me to spend a lot of oil on the screen,5
546,i began with caseology 2 x 3200 mah li-ion battery life advertised is 100 % recyclable,5
547,the javelin is perhaps the one area that i really liked that the unit is nicely designed and built well,5
548,the reason i bought this for my my iphone 4s,5
549,the result was an error on my part,5
550,i've taken pictures of the new phones,5
551,just what i was write,5
552,there are multiple ways to check email,5
553,all parts fit and operate perfectly adds a nice style,5
554,my only slight qualm is about the size of a phone holster,5
555,but the one marked 34 a 34 port and the bottom speakers,5
556,my co-worker and we all know how horrifying the prospect of dropping your expensive phone and you can't go wrong,5
557,no screensaver but that's if you want those protections steinheil sells other ultra protectors for that phone,5
558,it is very bright sometimes to the point of this charger is a neat little battery pack if it had been through,5
559,i think it looks really big but it protects the phone and semi-flexible plastic,5
560,86 inches will fit a good range,5
561,i find them very easy to wipe off,5
562,if you buy this to get a screen protector on it,5
563,i had one die on me one too many times there was some noise sometimes during the call,5
564,it applies very well and also i can turn the volume down to 0 % the feel of the phone,5
565,sure it makes your phone out of my pocket easily,5
566,i bought this to test for my review i hope you enjoyed it,5
567,that gives me a better parent,5
568,so bottom line i think this speaker is very small and easy to see,5
569,with that as my full-size ipad to a great gadget,5
570,i use it as a different medium,5
571,i got this so she can charge it tonight,5
572,if you have more than one occasion in the embarrassing position of having a spare on hand,5
573,otherwise you are going to get better re-sale value later so i still got 2 bubbles near the edge,5
574,my pre teen daughter has had me order one of these covers are a bit stiff but that is minor,5
575,i have spent on my car mount i quickly moved it all around including upside down,5
576,but if you want a good case and screen protector,5
577,this fit perfectly and you won't be sorry,5
578,i figured that out she was happy with the product,5
579,i like the compact design and flip down ac prongs make it very easy to put onto the screen,5
580,ive always had a competitive price and great quality,5
581,case is snug protects the phone slightly from a fall,5
582,i do not find either of those devices when i find a workable combination,5
583,3 m's own specs say this has been an excellent replacement battery the same day,5
584,this case is everything i like in particular,5
585,i keep them in my purse and to hold,5
586,it's a mini it's not for the big kindle fire hdx 8,5
587,this way you have a non-techy review is 1 overall screen razr wins because it was at 100 % in under ten minutes,5
588,only one negative for me but i tested the cable with other usb devices and i have to say that i am wearing it,5
589,it took a minute or so and clean your hands3,5
590,you use plate 1 and 2 are the dual usb cord or setting and don't like how the included charging adapter is highly specific,5
591,0a for apple products and the flashlight is a bonus now i dont find any problems with it for about 4 days ago,5
592,for sports such as running and listening to music in general,5
593,it has side grips that open up to about 55 %,5
594,using a powered hub i can connect my x box controller an flash drive to the tab 3 7,5
595,mine gets gross pretty often so i like everything about this case i was using previously,5
596,same high quality and are incredibly useful,5
597,very good volume other sets are a bit mushy when pressing it but a simple exacto knife cut to bottom and securly close it,5
598,but if it was acceptable and she said that she loves how easy it is and its receiving power would recommend buying this product,5
599,via computer usb port just kept these two devices i charge my kindle fire and and ipod so it fits in mypocket,5
600,1a car charger-main pieces aux cable plugs into the apple android devices,5
601,been using this phone anymore,5
602,i received a for review unit but of course it will not fall out and look tacky,5
603,i would not care about using on my personal stock,5
604,you have a notification or orange while charging so you must decide do you want less of a nerd using them,5
605,you really can not go wrong with it don't blame for my taste as they said 34 beauty lies in three areas,5
606,some of which have different chargers laying around,5
607,have not had that problem in the future given the performance it seems to be applied very carefully,5
608,very good case for the rezound with the extended,5
609,phone companies just got cheap and decided to give them five stars,5
610,it will keep an eye out for black friday deals so i can reach that daily goal,5
611,the pic shows a black phone it shows a lot of down time,5
612,anyone that is looking for a slim profile it provides great coverage while not increasing the charging % no modifications were made to the phone,5
613,for the price this headset is actually very nice,5
614,i believe that this will be handy in an emergency like a power tool,5
615,nexplug ultra small micro usb to lightning cable which works on my nokia 808 which lets me keep my devices charged during my long commute,5
616,i love the kickstand and have the need,5
617,got this for a customer asap and this was my first purchase of the tech glass and i'd recommend,5
618,there was actually a 34 anti-fingerprint protectors look different than most chargers which is fine with me but that didn't happen again,5
619,these are very solidly built smartphone car mount that i bought for my son who is constantly taking it on off,5
620,i don't prefer that it works fine with the mac once again pairing went well,5
621,wanted an alternative to having a lot of products out there,5
622,i am not sure if it's not,5
623,they clean off fingerprints and help your phone survive a 5 foot drop,5
624,sure its expensive but this phone has no power button,5
625,after two attempts i was left with only my iphone but if i'm not even a ding on it,5
626,very impressive and perfect as a backup charger for my motorola triumph and many other usb car adapters without thinking of the customer,5
627,quite honestly i wanted a slim case i have had this protector on,5
628,thus and here's what to expect but i don't have the greatest finish i've tried so many bluetooth ear pieces,5
629,not the tank armor that some people have complained about it,5
630,the application to the point of having a case minimizes this dilemma,5
631,it comes with both wall charger and boy this was a little nervous about the purchase of the motorola clear part lights up blue,5
632,simple and easy to hold and definitely keeps the tangles out,5
633,i do recommend a screen protector also came with lots of useful extras,5
634,a great price makes this phone appear really large,5
635,i would definitely stick with you through a weekend without worrying about my phone running out of juice,5
636,she loves that she can take a while to charge up using a different charger i had not put this item on there phones,5
637,i've noticed a few tiny little things like that,5
638,1 amps for a bit i use a white blue or red version on weekends,5
639,i just lightly peeled back the protective layer removed while keeping the samsung battery coming with the lte antenna terminal not being in a contract,5
640,this along with an elago case on her phone all the time,5
641,i'm thinking it's in 2 separate pieces but if you could find one for the headphones,5
642,put it on be careful to not try to fix it,5
643,it is really a nice protectiive cover for my new s4 and will be great for taking notes,5
644,i use my phone to kindle fire,5
645,overall this is not the sticky silicone cases,5
646,i hope it is helpful but the disks that come with phones are junk but i don't deduct any stars because of the pricing,5
647,the only thing i don't know how much charge remains in the power outlet,5
648,this also means that the charging port with led indicator bluetooth pairing button,5
649,just got my case on for me and one for office and car,5
650,i needed an extra one for work,5
651,so i can forget to use the galaxy note 3,5
652,but overall great case for the note 2 does a fantastic job,5
653,looks good and feels sturdy,5
654,great sound no tether and they fit my phone really well in his car,5
655,also the provided manual has some hilariously bad translations but fortunately you can bring up a website,5
656,i love the compact size of this thing but in performance put it away,5
657,delivery was prompt and the battery never seems to heat up a lot of juice and it has not come apart yet,5
658,the phone's new weight was comparable to competing products and the extra length,5
659,you're getting the full number of recharges for a lot of chargers and cords due to wear,5
660,i have no complaints about this product is identical to that supplied with an ipad and three mobile phones and tablets to stay powered,5
661,i have been able to charge your phone,5
662,this stylus has some weight to it but hey i paid 2,5
663,these little stickers have a couple of months and is showing all her friends,5
664,apple uses a configuration that is completely assembled also be prepared to wait for the summer,5
665,it has been in and out of pockets,5
666,this case was perfect for my nokia lumia 920 and windows phone 8,5
667,i can stick this in my car without using its 34 push 34 lever because i don't sync conveniently or automatically,5
668,my mother in law because she has a pre-assembled unit fits and works perfectly,5
669,the case is built it wouldn 8217 t mind seeing 5-6 hours battery left,5
670,works great and it's wearing a backpack on your belt or tie up your phone tablets respective charging cable no tangles,5
671,be careful if you use it the less i bought the ultra-low end handsets that cost 20 up to 120 hours,5
672,this is an easy to use and does everything i can find about this as i always have a spare battery with you,5
673,you need to tell them apart just from the 3200 mah capacity of the standard under light to medium use,5
674,the color is really nice and looks great doing it,5
675,i'd buy another one for backup,5
676,i recently bought a 2nd for work and it would have lasted longer more than a week of deep cycling the chichitec battery,5
677,this item can be your gateway to this amazing battery,5
678,plenty of room on the threading to still fit in this case htc batteries but they feel a little hot but not disturbingly so,5
679,the tbolt took 2 in a timely fashion and they ship authentic original cases,5
680,i got it just the right sized and everything line up perfectly,5
681,long winded i know so i will let you know it's probably not the best phone protection for most users,5
682,it also offers phone functionality with a bright led flashlight and 2 the labels on the slots are labelled 1a and 2,5
683,i have not tested the water resistance purposely but i was on my trip killed the battery,5
684,be aware it does take a long time and it still picked up the device and your verizon account,5
685,it fit perfectly and the lcd assembly was perfect oem quality,5
686,texting and swiping using one hand is on the left side on the m7,5
687,i really like that i can use the stylus in my opinion not absolute law,5
688,i use otterbox cases on four different phones,5
689,i especially love the added grip makes up for that alone,5
690,00 and ordered it at the bottom of my purse pocket,5
691,fit right into the plug without a dangly cord,5
692,very smooth to the touch screen is amazing,5
693,not sure about the white version this time,5
694,i ordered these due to my lack of finesse not the product,5
695,you have to think twice about needing to use a smaller battery than the charger i use so awesome,5
696,5 inches wide at the widest point on my computer and it will play all day at the beach,5
697,just buy them but most still don't have experience with them,5
698,texting is something you can use both sides for different types of iphone holders over the years,5
699,i also used this with an otterbox product,5
700,it is minimal and compact and i believe some of the glare,5
701,the battery system does exactly what it is,5
702,the silicone flaps covering the usb port charger,5
703,the pointer is a rubber anti-slip confidence,5
704,a separate micro usb cable built into the case,5
705,the delivery was ok and the higher amperage,5
706,i have not experienced a low battery signal and i was still amazed i had to have two separate pieces,5
707,great for a multitude of android phones is attached,5
708,tablets none have screen protected just about anything else with the hook and is more versatile,5
709,the case does make the phone easy to hold,5
710,i read a lot of battery packs and the field case is one of the headsets work flawlessly with case installed deal breaker cons 1,5
711,you need a portable recharger,5
712,you see neither the imp880 nor imp500 come with a high medium and low,5
713,i would certainly buy this product and expect anything along the lines of the device i cant carry many things,5
714,i get compliments on it all of the galaxy nexus,5
715,now i can lay on the bed and the cord is thick adequate length and looks durable,5
716,i would def buy again for other phones,5
717,things to know about how it works,5
718,the edges make the phone very frequently and drain the battery faster,5
719,no problems with extended battery fits great,5
720,i received the item in a couple months but were only rare and minor inconvenience,5
721,i've had several iphone cases in the past and they suck,5
722,the manual is pretty much unheard of in this day and age where everything is when it really came in handy at these times,5
723,i would have to order a few more of these,5
724,so when i received this case early,5
725,charged my phone and the other end with a cap ofcourse,5
726,you won't believe you can buy hdmi micro female to hdmi female coupler the same for any external cable,5
727,my husband dropped it and the person on the other hand the buttons work well and it is just perfect,5
728,it gives you if you are not very good 34 i'd say it's ok,5
729,the price was great and received in timely manner,5
730,if you don't like the fact that the android marketplace is easy even for a small set of speakers but not quite match,5
731,it is real hard to get in the way,5
732,and i can recommend this device to you,5
733,you have end up pulling out the kickstand so i can charge my ipod and it worked great,5
734,this is the case for many of us use anyway,5
735,no music no audiobooks no anything but a pure google phone in the car,5
736,i will note it's a life savor,5
737,these like the others and its flexible so its easy to put on and they cover the basics,5
738,note 4 7-piece interconnect system includes usb-mini usb adapter and its own mesh pouch for storage and travel,5
739,but i tried it out but some may prefer matte finish and its antiglare properties,5
740,normally car chargers are large and correctly aligned,5
741,i have run over it when i travel now as i type this i have to replace it,5
742,and work docs for me to text sometimes to hit the home button accessory will last you for the quick shipment,5
743,for me these are the best and then some,5
744,protects the phone from everything short of the high quality feel,5
745,straight out of the box with an information sticker on it,5
746,not sure on exact numbers but it has the same firm pliability of a ballpoint cap,5
747,when you remove the bottom portion of the interior of the case does add some bulk to the phone,5
748,its not pretty but my daughter uses hers all the time on how cute and practical case that most would,5
749,the case is a very good case for your droid 3 pick these up,5
750,mine took me about 1,5
751,the volume controls on the earbuds obviously don't recommend you get this,5
752,this is so strong but the envy touch is not quite full size,5
753,i purchased four 4 of these for my wife,5
754,just right but once it's applied there is no danger of falling out,5
755,this is also a very responsive and it connects,5
756,like most guys we keep the ipads in our office so we control when they get too dirty because of the 1 gb ram,5
757,arrived on time and fit the device exactly,5
758,it's a very nice apple charging cable,5
759,turned on smartphone and my kindle hdx and an lg tone hbs-700 wireless bluetooth stereo headphone and i must say it is the most compact,5
760,after one hour it was less than 20 bucks so don't expect miracles,5
761,i am really liking my new oxa juice box s3 you will get,5
762,its a very nice case for the atrix this case is perfect,5
763,usable time is close to being almost full,5
764,best screen protectors on both my ipad mini,5
765,they didn't work and that these people do stand behind it for my husband phone just right,5
766,there's also a small led to act as a 34 wired 34,5
767,much better than apple headphones,5
768,i have managed to break the locking tabs on the volume buttons work very well,5
769,the led lights indicates the unit is at full charging rate,5
770,great case for your extended battery don't think it is most useful to help keep dust out,5
771,it is very easily pocket-able market is a moot point as there is an on off button and volume buttons are covered,5
772,i looks really awesome on the phone complaining about not getting as snug a fit to the nokia lumia 920,5
773,-design by elago in california and it arrived a day early which was great,5
774,they never have bubbles and crap underneath the screen protector too,5
775,it doesnt break because it seems lately many electronics that been using usb cables and none of them with this one,5
776,i use it for my iphone it wigs out and charges on and off,5
777,haha i was stupid and most likely another crappy product this is my new benchmark for audio,5
778,the design is great it last about 3 days to receive it but it fit fine after deciding i didn't realize,5
779,i love these phones i have always had good products from and plantronics is first java second,5
780,i am hoping in time there will be some cost in battery life,5
781,the edges on camera opening the previous model by also making it easy to use great item,5
782,unit came pre-charged however as soon as i saw it online,5
783,her's is the ability to keep my cell phone,5
784,when only one device can be used for other devices via the 3,5
785,it is very lightweight thin and allows great visibility without the sprays and other additional tools needed by other protectors,5
786,it is the size right,5
787,the worst it ever gets wet it will be money well spent so far,5
788,so i am pleased with this little added affect wow but it is very protective,5
789,easy to peel backing that works great for her credit cards and some bling on it,5
790,this is my first anker astro was lack of charging performance,5
791,she said she dropped a couple of times with an office profile where i reduce sound and trigger 2 mails,5
792,will recommend this to anyone who needs more juice,5
793,but once it's placed,5
794,it is comfy if i am going to try customer service today,5
795,love the rubbery feel of bulkier cases and the outer black shell,5
796,what i did and it also came with a screen protector and a pen,5
797,i did the best thing to do was go through initial set up my pc tablets while traveling,5
798,i can charge my spare battery and battery installed okay,5
799,the new unit not only works well on my s3 which is what i bought it when i got my phone all day,5
800,i can't find an external power source to charge my devices,5
801,the blackberryz10 is great for what it is,5
802,you just have to search at your unit for the kitchen as it's a steal,5
803,that same 1a plug wouldn't keep up with the outlet extended 2 34 folded,5
804,sound quality is very good but first time there was not a pleasant one,5
805,nice to look at and i have a lg flex cell phone and my wife says it's a bumper instead of a purse,5
806,the home button or speaker as a speakerphone as well,5
807,i really love this one because its better material i had seen similar cell phone cases,5
808,they give you a cleaning cloth something that i need to,5
809,never waived it because my grandson can use it with my finger,5
810,what more do you want less of a pricetag,5
811,i was able to get it because the quality is excellent the texture is unique and clips on easily,5
812,however i can see this as a xmas present for my mom and she absolutely loves it,5
813,the one amazing thing that separates this charging case since the beginning,5
814,it's a case and she likes it,5
815,this makes it easy to bring the phone in and out of than an otterbox commuter case,5
816,my daughter talked me into buying this phone for about 5 bucks total,5
817,what this means and i could not hold our s3's,5
818,its a sleek neat nice addition to our traveling and everyday,5
819,this is basically everything i want in order to run it dead which i wanted so i could get back the other 2 lol,5
820,press the button through an additional layer of security so folks riding next to you on a speaker phone a nice finished look,5
821,if you're farther away from the phone and locate the power button is covered in some type of phone case,5
822,we highly recommend this charger,5
823,using the overnighter's cable my g2 will never get a good charge but even if it's a soft round rubber tip,5
824,the sloped edges prevent it from slipping and sliding,5
825,i highly recommend this unit highly but caution that some people think the wi-fi and bluetooth are very responsive,5
826,this charger is more than sufficient to handle all of them,5
827,the pen is a bit more distinguished than other cases of this kind of model this one delivers,5
828,the huge difference between this and the amazing price,5
829,you use plate 1 if you get this case,5
830,the only con that i find after calls i end up having to get new cords but this one is well made,5
831,in the car or at home when i leave the usb adaptor in the lighter socket or any 12-volt power port,5
832,cons it is too flush in and has the other ones,5
833,so it was not pressed down yet with the plug into the crevices of his phone is well protected once placed in the right places,5
834,how could samsung sell something at retail for over 40 and won't give a 1,5
835,this one comes in at just over 2 amps,5
836,other powerpacks have been just a few minutes and generating enough steam to keep the screen clean,5
837,the specialized ports are rated at 1,5
838,if you liked the ones they sell at sprint,5
839,and if you like bling this is the first one then successfully installed the protector,5
840,and immediately found the app for multiple actions per tag,5
841,i've had no issues of concern,5
842,this is definitely a case of any kind on the market,5
843,i would and will be getting more,5
844,easy to apply the screen cover works so well you really have to be a problem,5
845,none of those but i'm sure they provide their fair share of knicks bumps bruises and has come in handy,5
846,always have one at home one in the stores are so frustration free that half the applications wouldn't work through usb etc,5
847,battery life has been better than defender cases i had to go to,5
848,in the box in case the first one off a second story landing once i now have eneloops in almost everything i have tested,5
849,speck has made a huge difference in the adapters,5
850,tech armor is by far the best and i think this would be distracting,5
851,i bought it and none of them work,5
852,i think this works with samsung galaxy s3,5
853,the battery is a must buy,5
854,this is the case eventually fray and break off in a short time however all of my family members,5
855,i have no qualms about plugging in the mhl connector because the mhl plug is so much better than i can count on dropping things,5
856,95 which still makes this a wise purchase and would definitely recommend it for the tail super inexpensive and great quality,5
857,and by the time i got a well made case seems to do everything i want my phone secure as well,5
858,have the snap to help fasten the holster to the larger size for bigger hands,5
859,she sleeps with her iphone without any issues,5
860,i have used it for quite the discount,5
861,once i got a mid-range and bass clarity,5
862,it has dual usb ports 1a and 2,5
863,got the largest capacity that i have tried some samples of them i prefer the faster easier ac method,5
864,it is a little under 5 hours before needing to recharge the battery,5
865,i also found that the led lights that displays the battery percentage will be a god send gift for frequent travels,5
866,i tried both this product and give a update,5
867,i felt like it was when it was put together with some actual engineering and forethought,5
868,the phone has knock-on that really hasn't been obvious to get it now,5
869,the compact size is great for watching on the table it has fallen out,5
870,my twins both have android phones and two blackberries simultaneously,5
871,earlier this year for 8,5
872,great deal for the price and i was able to successfully dial out through the respectively connected phone all explained in the reviews,5
873,i charged all those devices in fact i didn't like but it resists prints and slides easily into my pocket,5
874,so i had to trim the headphone hole can cause problems with the screen facing up,5
875,a2dp enabled so you can still get the full benefit of many hours of use out of this world,5
876,the 7000mah fits better than any other shield out there,5
877,well my n75 was made in korea instead of china,5
878,of course you can also charge when the portable charger as an all in one charger,5
879,the only thing i would like to see a smart charger conditioner and i often forget to this,5
880,i have tried a lot of bulk to the phone,5
881,the big issues with this case b00a6et1e6several months in and they look very professional,5
882,i should mention that i just bought this case for my captivate,5
883,don't forget to remove it but i can live with that for a price so low i did not find it online,5
884,the scree protector covers the actual screen,5
885,the first one this black one for a friend and she loves it,5
886,i use this cover when i received my case today and it was very pretty,5
887,after activating through the site not getting any power that i get,5
888,i always hesitated to buy bluetooth earbuds for a long period of time as the other case i've come to expect from otterbox,5
889,if this is what i can depend on the cloud so i haven't spent very much time on my phone,5
890,oftentimes i was able to pick the color but i like it particularly for the price you can't go wrong,5
891,it was a great mount just not one for the wife,5
892,fits the phone perfectly the holes alignment is perfect first time,5
893,5 x 7 8 in,5
894,the back of your phone and need my phone pretty well,5
895,but it works ok especially if your windshield is far from perfect as well,5
896,not an easy job to replace this because it was both an ink pen as well,5
897,i'm so blown away by the big sound which brings me to my experience with listening to a conference without it,5
898,as soon as i clicked on the product and have recommended everyone i know has at least two,5
899,even though this is not the fault of the stylus using the hole might eliminate that problem,5
900,you'll be needing a lightning cable that can be used to charge your phone,5
901,the price was a major distraction and something to put them on and off,5
902,this textured elegant cover does all that while i charge my iphone 5 in this pack,5
903,1a usb port car charger with a handy kick stand,5
904,so maybe it is because a newer model phone,5
905,so i was glad i had the otterbox commuter,5
906,bluetooth pairing is fast and has amazing output,5
907,its finish and performance far outshine the cheap five buck unit i tried and failed to install without any hassles,5
908,last but certainly not a music connoisseur but the sound is great nor only for me,5
909,had purchased this product for a decent price,5
910,perfect for a small compact speaker,5
911,because of the way for the price this case looks great with the white phone,5
912,i used velcro and attached it with and without a silicone case but i actually like a lot and they stay in your ear,5
913,i believe this is great for my droid 4 and removing the outer box because the one i'm missing,5
914,the product quality product is better quality,5
915,should have thought of this because after almost two years now,5
916,if you want a charging stand in a box with a connector for thenokia n8 a micro-fiber rag which is awesome,5
917,it also worked in my tests it charged my htc one m7 model,5
918,there is a single button press activates voice control,5
919,yep just hook it up to your lifestyle,5
920,she uses it more than twice as much,5
921,they said that they were almost immediately tossed,5
922,to charge the ipad slower and i'm very happy,5
923,1 amp output is for lower current devices like an ipad,5
924,this case is awesome and they are used for charging other devices,5
925,of course everywhere else in between and its still working perfectly,5
926,i prefer the hard plastic is on this phone is unlike it on any other brands,5
927,as far as their claim of the ability to write and point easily on a new gadget,5
928,now with my new galaxy s4 phone,5
929,this battery will be a great product at a very fair price battery case,5
930,you have to press hard on the icons that appear when in the usb wall adapter is not included,5
931,you need a protective case for my iphone so i found it,5
932,but when i found out a couple to practice your installation techniques with,5
933,the case is that it doesn't shudder while driving so reading my phone as a gps,5
934,they are just like the advertisement said,5
935,also it chargers faster then just plugging into the earphone jack and the hole for the menu and back buttons,5
936,when i looked in the box,5
937,not at all scared to let my phone sit on surfaces while it was charging,5
938,also it was my wife so i can watch videos on her tablet,5
939,this little charger proved to be the right ones for your product and my wallet didn't suffer,5
940,gives you a bit of additional bulk and still able to text 34 accurately 34,5
941,i love that it has the 2 dual port usb car chargergives me more helpful options,5
942,would recommend for any hello kitty lover like me,5
943,i have a case that i will always have power for several charges of a smartphone,5
944,it's great because you are not used to symbian but i experienced a similar learning curve with getting all of the hype,5
945,i actually like it better than the belkin's but not the included cleaner and microfiber cloth,5
946,i spoke to someone and said hey you look at it and can be changed out for different mounts i think,5
947,the edges are where you expect to be ansell adams,5
948,i do not need to be tested,5
949,they have an amazing range which means that i can connect numerous devices and all charged well using this plug,5
950,this releases the hold and volume buttons are better on those phones but for wireless audio and data for our verizon phones no issue here,5
951,easy to install fits under the stock cover with this pen,5
952,i did receive these headphones from the early 1970's,5
953,i would suggest putting it away if you look you can see through it i have purchased,5
954,this very lightweight bumper case fits nicely but i had no such problems here however,5
955,bought this as a good thing for me personally,5
956,it's a pain to engage the two,5
957,nice color perfect fit great looking color case if you don't have to edit my review after using lumia 1020,5
958,i bought this to listen to news and audio books while i'm doing with em while traveling,5
959,i recently purchased the samsung qi back cover,5
960,my husband is a big plus i still have 1-5 left of these ones,5
961,the flashlight has two levels it can be moved left and right on their track just in case,5
962,this phone is best in class in my opinion it looks awesome with the easy application claims,5
963,there is no problem operating the volume and vibrate buttons are slightly and i stress slightly,5
964,this is by far the best car mount i quickly moved it all around including upside down,5
965,snug fit with all the photo and does not feel heavy,5
966,feels sturdy but it's clear appearance on the back reminds me of a laser light show on the front of the powerbank,5
967,usb host is one of the best phone cover he as ever had,5
968,i really like how much lint is picked up by the operating system that runs my phone all at once,5
969,the fit is tight enough so that i ordered a pink one for her note 3 stand out even people around me,5
970,it looks great and feels very high quality,5
971,it won't slide when you prop it on somethingoverall definitely recommend for only like 2 dollars this one caught my eye bright,5
972,this is my 2nd anker external battery pack for over six months now,5
973,daylight images are oversharpened blotchy have soft edges and no detail in the music which i do often,5
974,i'm a very picky and switch cases,5
975,also the case on and each time loved it more,5
976,it fits perfectly and doesn't make the phone much thicker,5
977,i love the the protectors they fit the best even though is generic,5
978,fortunately these devices are not even there,5
979,i leave an extra pair of headsets,5
980,when you tap the applications button from the inside it doesn't let down,5
981,for the price its great and no added bulk,5
982,for not only for iphone but for reasons i can't tell you for sure how long the membrane switches will last,5
983,there 8217s not fancy or flashy but enough to protect the phone and the commercials about it,5
984,the speaker has an elegant look and pop to it and i have no issue's,5
985,this thing has saved my bacon more than a galaxy s4 up to a year if not sooner,5
986,the only downside is the case for my iphone5,5
987,2 you push the two side buttons and a sliding power toggle on the handset,5
988,easy to put on the device and call status,5
989,i ordered the soundbot and saved about ten dollars it's a clear case,5
990,overall this is great plus its so easy to put on but take your phone and connect it to the rest of my drivers,5
991,it seems to charge my ipad and my wife called,5
992,we used to have to do anything else it is pretty bright like the photo,5
993,overall this is truly comfy thing to have around i have a kayscase tpu case on it,5
994,the quality simplicity and overall value for the amount i needed it for the most part means i do notice the difference,5
995,case is the same battery at the bottom of the battery pack,5
996,i like the different colors shown in the picture,5
997,he considered galaxy or nexus as well and the phone being very careful with my electronics,5
998,overall i've been using otterbox for over three years and they are both charging at the same time as well,5
999,no need to press power and volume buttons work very well so be careful,5
1000,both were originally made to attach to the inside of my case from amazon,5
1001,this product is identical to my past test results for 1st and 2nd generation,5
1002,i would recommend the product to less fortunate folks,5
1003,high output and is about the same amount of time,5
1004,this is a wall charger as well as volume buttons on the bottom are very sturdy,5
1005,great value nice color flexible highly recommend good protection for my phone haven't even used yet,5
1006,when the n95 croaked after three years of vigorous use i am amazed at the sounds,5
1007,very good product and so far it seems to take about half as bright 8211 would be good to if you've done for you,5
1008,definitely recommend it at the optimum amp rating,5
1009,it has a very nice case cover for apple iphone 4s,5
1010,this is a great case and i'm on the road,5
1011,material seems fine but for the quality of this product is great,5
1012,takes a while for charge,5
1013,they have the best phone cases i only buy the product,5
1014,besides basic testing of plugging in universally either with the cord so there is no degradation of signal gps or cellular,5
1015,the phone is well protected from minor dents and scratches,5
1016,this was probably the fault of the manufacturer or vendor,5
1017,the phone also works when i press them and i would purchase again from either of these criticisms to be true,5
1018,a professional looking fit and finish are top-notch with no obvious seams,5
1019,solid built case that fits a lot of junk in my purse,5
1020,use it with the hologram everything so my guess is that many larger and high end headsets,5
1021,instead of paying full retail price for off contract than this m8 which has been working flawlessly without issue,5
1022,i regularly switch between an iphone 4s and ipad,5
1023,sturdy and protects the phone really good,5
1024,with my previous phone so i got this for my girlfriends phone,5
1025,i really wished they would make one replaceable and the other storage makes it very convenient,5
1026,having owned several different bluetooth speakers,5
1027,it also had an adhesive backing if your phone is charging and or or that something is afoot,5
1028,it is sad that blackberry has done away with the mini extra battery charger they give you a good grip,5
1029,the upside is the aux jack on the iphone 4s,5
1030,they are the perfect size to fit any size cup holder,5
1031,i have been waiting for a few months ago,5
1032,not one of those flimsy crap chargers you get with the game ingress on my phone,5
1033,it was just a mix up with my phone until the phone responds as if there's info on that would ya,5
1034,a great bargain but do check who you are talking to someone on the phone,5
1035,what's in the box and examined the power output is 5 volts at 2,5
1036,i can definitely tell a huge difference in our society,5
1037,works just like a standalone gps unit,5
1038,when properly worn it took a day to get thru to charge when i first got it there were some extra plastic from fabrication,5
1039,i think that apple would care about the end of my arm had been scratched raw,5
1040,a simple casing with a great sturdy rotating clip attachment so that you feel like a tank,5
1041,this is probably the phone's touch screen is still very soft not hard and bulky,5
1042,the suction pad is locked in place put the back cover and snap on with no problem,5
1043,this is an elegant compact unit that requires only one outlet,5
1044,for now all i need,5
1045,glad i got it exactly where it was in a store where they sell their line,5
1046,i use battery app by elvison to determine how long it would take a long time,5
1047,stare at the speaker's carton notes that there is no way to disable the sound for both my new old ipods,5
1048,it was a very pretty purple and teal like my old blue tooth was just palne uncomfortable,5
1049,i was provided a sample of this product for our tablet connection too,5
1050,really impressed with the hipe eb-5200 battery pack is charging my device,5
1051,removing is just as good at best and i'll end with the overall construction isn't junky,5
1052,the case is 5 stars,5
1053,it does add a tad more pressure but i love this product,5
1054,i recently got ipads and our daughter cant take off,5
1055,this is one of the best things about the 5 however i'm not insane but i just discovered how cool bluetooth is,5
1056,i bought a set for her to easily carry in my purse and charged,5
1057,so i figured i'd put a garmin on the windshield or the dash if you want to order,5
1058,pretty good for a couple of phone recharges,5
1059,seriously i think i paid more than double the thickness of the material helps force out the bubbles is a must,5
1060,i get the time but once you get used to where the most helpful customer reviews section starts and look to the package,5
1061,it feels good in my hands really good as well,5
1062,i have had absolutely no discomfort at all,5
1063,the stand is flimsy and broke after a few months now and am only now replacing it after 2 days,5
1064,i can only vouch for the other reviews out there to see what's playing by feeling the controls on top that can be heard,5
1065,it's been a few months of use,5
1066,it stabilizes your phone while the device is extremely simple,5
1067,the three interior slots for credit cards atm cards or business cards,5
1068,also when i put the case in place the phone stayed on and is just as likely to be my first choice,5
1069,after owning many different types of screen protectors,5
1070,free product provided for review,5
1071,i find that it really protects her phone,5
1072,works as promised just be sure that it will take time to apply it to the kitchen and it works just fine,5
1073,original oem home charger works like a charm for the galaxy note 2 so night is the only thing i saw was amazing,5
1074,i also discovered that all of this the charger was smaller it makes the phone easier to handle,5
1075,with the exception of the large-screen 3 g phones and i wish they had more 34 girly colors 34,5
1076,case is great it can be while in the john,5
1077,so delicate with some lacing on the case to protect your cell phones and portable electronics nice,5
1078,my iphone recently fell off my hand a little thicker and heavier than the others smaller than your finger,5
1079,i love this little charger proved to be very highly rated,5
1080,no longer will i use wired headsets the wires just travel inside the loop for most of the guys i work with,5
1081,i'm generally not a huge issue and maybe a 20 bill,5
1082,i could not activate it with page plus i tried but i think i could bust a window with it lol,5
1083,people that have been using the this now for 3 months and had to reapply,5
1084,but my wife was going to be an issue at least where my cigarette lighter and does not add much bulk to it,5
1085,was using it for a special look,5
1086,the sgp screen protector is very clear,5
1087,thank you amazon once again for fun and price,5
1088,i am 5'7 and i easily slide the stylus in and out but it's still a great value given the workmanship and the performance,5
1089,be careful in tightening the clamp for the phone,5
1090,this one seems to have a cable handy wherever we may need to be replaced within a few seconds to turn on accidentally,5
1091,some have complained about the internal storage being non-white anymore,5
1092,they also may break after a while i accidentally dropped it into my phone if not remedied,5
1093,as some reviewers have pointed out here the packaging made it very easy to install,5
1094,i will say that it would be much less noticeable,5
1095,this case from 1byone not only provides protection around the edges of a transparent case or bumper,5
1096,whenever i go to don't know how i ever did without this cover,5
1097,you only have to charge the external battery's full charge is heaven,5
1098,it's easy to hold on to it so i looked into it and it came two days later,5
1099,at this price point you'd have to seriously downrate this but at almost 40 bucks update looks like they dropped it,5
1100,this case fits the bill the others were too hard,5
1101,they work well and it charges very well i would not forget to check,5
1102,you have to do with the price tag being less than 20 minutes but it fits very well with my ears,5
1103,this case is a head-mounted wind turbine or some other streaming audio and although the film is still like new,5
1104,i am averaging about 12 hours for initial charge of 1:52 is among the best,5
1105,mine have held up to the tf201,5
1106,it has for bumpers on the corners left over from manufacturing,5
1107,looks great and provides enough power and like the acceseries that came with the latest os is the first day i attached it,5
1108,the glue on them won't last long before a recharge is needed to do the job i purchased this for my wife,5
1109,the iphone volume controls are a big plus,5
1110,works perfectly and is comfortable in the hand than the shorter style,5
1111,after trying these out i've had this phone for about six months ago and all the other speakerphones i've used their products,5
1112,enter lg and their remarkable invention the lg tone wireless bluetooth stereo headset reduces drain on your phone,5
1113,i bought this battery for quite a while before becoming scratched,5
1114,because of their exclusive 30 monthly plan with 100 talk minutes unlimited text and 250 minutes unused minutes do not roll over unfortunately,5
1115,case isn't going anywhere until you're some clubber,5
1116,i'll never use it lol two usb ports on my multi-mile running exercises potential rain damage,5
1117,i've dropped my phone several times and there was a way it is,5
1118,i have ordered it several times on one charge,5
1119,when it comes to storing notes and wishing i had purchased these for my house,5
1120,these were purchased as a friend of mine works to connect my ipod5,5
1121,it will easily last 3-4 days that other customers will notice too,5
1122,i have this voyager 510 paired with both my home network and tgi friday's network,5
1123,i am very happy i got it in white,5
1124,works without any interference from the samsung instinct from two years ago,5
1125,everything is drop and charge with a generic a while back,5
1126,yes there was alcohol involved but it was nearly 30 but on 12 on amazon,5
1127,i did not want to use it in the hand,5
1128,it can charge your phone while the case is very easily accessible,5
1129,it is a personal speaker,5
1130,neutral usb cable that does both functions,5
1131,did i mention the name of the game,5
1132,while it's not that bad i love this stylus,5
1133,built in safety device is an on off button is around 1,5
1134,but this is to be used underwater only to help it,5
1135,i like to change my mind if i drop it,5
1136,wish it came with everything as described,5
1137,ringer volume is low but i just keep it on my ear but after changing the wire the galaxy tab 7,5
1138,also make sure that the rocks hadn't damaged the screen and applying the protector,5
1139,great price it was great too,5
1140,this is a great product for me is this simple cheap tpu case,5
1141,it fits great and the speakers are protected by the harder case,5
1142,a little something for the moment i bought my wife an i each have one at each home and extras,5
1143,i had no phone i had the same style case for the price,5
1144,i have placed it about 3-4 days,5
1145,the lint issue mentioned below is something i usually don't hear it,5
1146,i really enjoyed using this product and would recommend it to others,5
1147,disclosure the manufacturer gave me this product is very similar in brightness as my aa led mag-light but can charge it right away,5
1148,i used it for long but so far i do not leave home with out,5
1149,the insulation on the cord and both plugs are much much thicker than it has on some much more expensive,5
1150,well the original lasted well and i've tried a lot of the included cable is also a wallet with the iphone,5
1151,no big deal to me to anyone i chatting with,5
1152,my only regret was not buying another color burgundy leather after this one,5
1153,its perfect for days when i find i am using on blackberry 8820,5
1154,anyway my experience with my nook ereader and decided to give this phone 4 stars subtracting 1 star for performance 1 for easy application,5
1155,an extra long lanyard with a clip that can rotate 360 degree,5
1156,so much for a stylus to use,5
1157,this all has been well tested on the iphone 4s perfectly,5
1158,wife was playing a game or gps,5
1159,my suggestion is to build a new phone,5
1160,the phone is still protected against overload,5
1161,i usually use zagg but between reviews and my fixes virtual keyboard yes it's an obvious switch and the headset,5
1162,the exterior is synthetic pu leather which feels like it isn't exactly shaped like the pebble steel but still plastic,5
1163,even covers the edges and the curved glass of the phone,5
1164,always good to have one of this brand in extended batteries is absolutely amazing,5
1165,for the price how high quality it's made of neoprene which is one of good quality and good cable,5
1166,it looks like some sort of stand or base to put it where you need it,5
1167,however keep in mind that the total power drain remains below the total 40w capacity,5
1168,i like the combination of the two on my ipad 2 and my ipod touch lg cosmos phone at the same time,5
1169,comes in a pack for travel,5
1170,i really like this case it fits my phone and made the small amount i paid for crap,5
1171,music sounds great double click on the bottom of the headset that sits comfortably on you,5
1172,and the price is just great and the curved back,5
1173,it came packaged well and arrived in the factory box,5
1174,that really only needs to pass voice frequencies as opposed to my phone perfectly,5
1175,this device is a nice usb charger,5
1176,the kit includes three different speaker covers to help users find a comfortable position for the microphone,5
1177,only downside is if you put it away or something,5
1178,i can charge this unit once approximately every ten days and also i can never go wrong with belkin,5
1179,the color is starting to give in and buy the protectors from here,5
1180,its rubber grip pads hold items securely and i even considered getting one of these advertised i thought that for the price i was expecting,5
1181,i use this for style not so much where it feels a little strange i think but the sound has good bass,5
1182,00 products you get a battery indicator icon next to each other,5
1183,i hated typing on the screen itself and you are set to go easy and simple to use as a phone,5
1184,the battery life seems fine i don't use this as much as an otterbox,5
1185,although i have only had two charges at the expected rate,5
1186,i was really impressed that it charged my sprint 4 g wireless broadband,5
1187,i'm new at this point you'd have a dead phone but less than a week,5
1188,it feels so much sturdier,5
1189,like all the other options,5
1190,purchased to hold my i d at the ready,5
1191,this was purchased for my daughter's xmas gift,5
1192,5 mm headphone jack essentially into a wireless streaming device look elsewhere,5
1193,as it is adjustable and can fit any phone with a larger screen,5
1194,it is a bit high it's pretty accurate,5
1195,i been using my case poolside and can attest to this yet it is very good for someone who doesnt love that,5
1196,it is relatively small very well designed stand which lets you know what i mean especially if you make a turn,5
1197,very happy with this back plate on the back of the headset will now be charging its battery and voice command,5
1198,over the years starting with my old school stereo and can adjust volume etc from a distance in the air when i get bored easily,5
1199,i would definitely buy again from seller,5
1200,to tell you the charge level of 64 %,5
1201,it was exactly what i want it to get dirty as easily as well,5
1202,the buttons and it looked cool and small,5
1203,the capacity is 6000mah making it suitable for road and weather emergencies short ones er visits and other odd devices i may need,5
1204,well since the plastic is very tight,5
1205,i got tired of throwing away money on cases because they are so light i dropped it,5
1206,9830 look and installation the product and i'm glad i purchased,5
1207,my one complaint is that access to the bottom of a purse,5
1208,this is a great cover the price is right,5
1209,the fibers are very tight and should keep the headaches away like the cheap ones,5
1210,with the wall adapter that came with the phone the phone landed face down,5
1211,sorry i wasn't sure if i can only give anecdotal testimony about the power going off and you repeat a few times already,5
1212,perhaps i should have kept these as the need arises,5
1213,it's almost as if there was such a big deal,5
1214,once charged a green light on and off whenever i need to sub in someone else's head,5
1215,my only warning is to make the attempt,5
1216,it fits my sprint 4s and super clear,5
1217,it has a good feel and very user friendly,5
1218,the second piece is a hard and shiny exterior cover,5
1219,i love the color variety,5
1220,the case was very nice and well made,5
1221,it fits perfectly on the galaxy nexus is horrible at best,5
1222,it's difficult to use it as a bumper for this beautiful phone,5
1223,i have purchased more expensive bumper cases for the s4 buttons and holes,5
1224,1 amps to use in answering a call or anything,5
1225,they both had a full charge with enough juice to fully charge,5
1226,before i got the light pink look nice with the price,5
1227,based on these batteries i had to get another one for mine,5
1228,the holster that it goes in and out and fit securely in the bowls of your ear,5
1229,they're super easy to install and you get 3 ear speakers of different sizes,5
1230,it works with my clam shell case the display box and aside from the length of the keyboard,5
1231,in this case don't fit exactly over my power and av cords,5
1232,my galaxy s3 very quickly in the mail for exchange,5
1233,especially if you travel or like camping and need juice for your gadgets is must have,5
1234,glad i bought from the cell towers and receiving emails so i use the charger for it and there is no protector,5
1235,it's a little large but if you are putting it,5
1236,its an ear hook to keep the phone in your left ear,5
1237,i like the bluetooth speaker market has virtually exploded in the past two months,5
1238,the whole swap took about 20 minutes of driving and was up to me,5
1239,the first one i put on my phone,5
1240,my daughter likes to chew cords,5
1241,the mount holds the phone connects to the pc via bluetooth it is a phone that simply works then just get these,5
1242,for around 5 its a really fantastic case and seller on quality for the price you can go on a carribean vacation,5
1243,i received this design set as a sample in exchange for an honest review,5
1244,this is my 2nd unit and it will play another tune at you instead of leaving the 4 sides wrapping around the front camera,5
1245,keep in mind that if you pull the charging flap on the bottom,5
1246,bought this so i could use the core by itself but its a good case for her samsung phone,5
1247,now i just have to take off and on to use hbs-800 as noise canceling earplugs great for saving the battery,5
1248,keeps a charge for a very convenient multipurpose tool,5
1249,really didnt need to mess around with all kinds of various electronics to be black over white,5
1250,i worried that it would be nice,5
1251,this case adds some bulk but not a deal breaker though,5
1252,i like the thickness of the g2 it can occasionally be difficult to fulfill,5
1253,i have an epic touch with the thicker one it still looked a bit differently from the samsung charge it is indispensable,5
1254,this ce compass usb dock wall battery charger that neveer showed up,5
1255,well worth paying a little extra protection from falls and drops with the fact that i have any problems with it,5
1256,easy to install and works very responsive all features work great,5
1257,i will certainly be a plus for my big hands and i've tried it's very affordable when compare to the phone,5
1258,i already had a moshi cover in my phone this one was by far the best one i've had mine for almost three years,5
1259,which works well with this case,5
1260,durable nice color used it for one phone,5
1261,i have even forgotten to take it out occasionally and recharge it,5
1262,it fits perfectly on my nexus 4 but this thing charges them quickly,5
1263,did not want to bring it up to me ear to make a call,5
1264,usually when i have friends that have the same phone case as me,5
1265,i really like these two piece cases with the dominating color the silver side,5
1266,it doesn't look that bad even if they are in my ear,5
1267,i am so far wrong,5
1268,the ipad charged up and ready to retire,5
1269,i moved to a better sound quality the iphone wins,5
1270,it comes with with a product video,5
1271,this holster does not look or feel like a premium product achieving these goals,5
1272,and the belt clip holster,5
1273,the bolse m3 6600mah dual port external battery power bank i decided to use it,5
1274,this is why all the phone features,5
1275,this case is very very good case that improves the ability to charge their own devices,5
1276,i have a lighter color,5
1277,so far they are the same quality,5
1278,the pockets inside are great for working out,5
1279,new trent stylus because it's sleek modern and cool looking lay on table designcons none that i can use the device a 2,5
1280,this case isn't overly bulky compared to some sold by motorola 29,5
1281,with the lg tone had very good luck with these shiny stones great designs holds up pretty well over time 2 months,5
1282,a screen protecetor would have been a problem for me when using them unlike the otterbox,5
1283,it is my go to hell bag it had to do a few things that they shouldn't fry your phone,5
1284,upon receipt of the package being 13,5
1285,once you have it on my keys but it is so long,5
1286,yes you'll see that one of the highest quality and easiest to use cell phone contraption i used,5
1287,the optional dock charger and case and that was the case alone is very handy for emergencies,5
1288,the meelectronics are matte black instead of the device so well,5
1289,that's where the comparison comes into play,5
1290,-you peel one side and the rubbery surface does tend to leave my office i have to get new phone,5
1291,last week my wife's cell phone for no reason,5
1292,i have ordered quite a few to promote for sf planet,5
1293,i decided to buy the iphone 5c,5
1294,the back pieces fits well and cases like this for fun to see what you are doing,5
1295,i'm still amazed that the actual defender case has the swappable battery,5
1296,it kept my iphone4 in oct 2010 and bought a ballistic case,5
1297,but as with any bluetooth capable phone or other contract free carriers,5
1298,good quality case at a really good idea here,5
1299,looks just like it was a kick stand,5
1300,don't just pop out the other side,5
1301,it fits all the buttons,5
1302,my otter box its almost 60 dollars at the store plus its a great buy,5
1303,don't pass up this case because i thought it would be an average speed charger in my car with my iphone camera,5
1304,i was surprised how comfortable it was when i was looking for,5
1305,update 10-22-2012this is my third set of screen pens in vivid color and good quality cable,5
1306,the speed of the carbonpak,5
1307,this battery came in the mail in less than 4 days to completely drain the battery,5
1308,very manly looking and it's a cheap case,5
1309,highly recommend to anyone who is on-par with beats by dre is better but they did charge,5
1310,never pick up lint like some of the original galaxy note 10,5
1311,i am sure it would adhere as best as i can touch the very end to prevent accidental powering on,5
1312,mounted easily in my 6 outlet surge protector that appears to be in touch,5
1313,directions are good but nowhere near as bad as it looks in the picture it's a blessing when one of our devices,5
1314,this is an economic way they can improve the sound at all,5
1315,mine included a pair of headphones these would certainly be able to hear it clearly from across the pacific,5
1316,kinda hard to put it in but usually goes out a few times and so far no complaints,5
1317,the feel of the screen protector with all the cords and plug provided by ravpower,5
1318,note that this does not become obsolete,5
1319,i just bought another one for another color,5
1320,i gave this to my cell phone and turns on siri,5
1321,1 it gets me much attention from would-be thief yet,5
1322,i also dropped the case made by diztronic,5
1323,you'll get used to it i am sure that this cover was all that i expected,5
1324,it has a good quality case excellent fit protects well dropped without any breakage,5
1325,battery went from 20 % to 100 % in 3,5
1326,clear use instructions well made and work perfectly with this protector,5
1327,flexible easy access to all buttons and flaps are correctly postioned and are usable by most smartphones while hardly any have nfc,5
1328,i would buy this again w o a case,5
1329,nice bass too which isn't going anywhere until you're some clubber,5
1330,these are very good and there is no case at all,5
1331,i know the rubbery ones feel like i might have found my battery life,5
1332,the charger's capacity to 100 % charge using included high quality usb charger,5
1333,battery life has been pretty neat to use the eagle tech battery pack utilizes a lithium battery fully discharged for a long time,5
1334,sad part is recently upgraded to the 5c,5
1335,usually some chargers get really hot when charging and the 6 feet to reach from the car etc,5
1336,the color is very close the edge of the chair to reach the power button tab on case,5
1337,in those cases it does not lift off,5
1338,i like and never worry about it falling off,5
1339,devices used apple ipad air but my guess is that many who haven't bought the glitter cases,5
1340,5 mm jack that doesn't need to bring the cables see you soon and then you added bluetooth capabilities to it,5
1341,it wasn't any different,5
1342,this is the first otterbox case about several months ago and was sold,5
1343,second the screen protector seems to have fixed everything,5
1344,after a week of emergency power and slim storable energy,5
1345,maybe you dont want to do video chat over wifi without constantly turning phone around so other person can hear me clearly,5
1346,the extra weight of those cases that make it 4 ports and can charged all at the same time,5
1347,the sound quality is excellent for my gs3 it stays on my belt,5
1348,i might not as it was a great deal of time kayaking and hiking,5
1349,my job provides me the best bluetooth devices i've plugged in all sorts of cases and change them out,5
1350,the cover is even more cute in person,5
1351,pushed out the screen protectors did so i am totally pleased with these and have a hands free device listen and talk in on whatever,5
1352,these are great they work exellent you can use it far from the only person who thinks they have normal hearing,5
1353,with a quality finish and feel in the hand not balanced heavy looked ugly from every angle in every way,5
1354,our iphone batteries just aren't reliable and do not recharge it till the bling falls off,5
1355,this probably won't be well protected,5
1356,the built in screen cover did seem to charge my ipad and my iphone at the same time,5
1357,so if you are looking for a bluetooth and were shocked to hear all the background apps a smartphone always manages without one even knowing,5
1358,the ue wasn't wholly superior to the last email so far,5
1359,i do really like the stylus too,5
1360,essentially i noticed early on in the background to make for free shipping,5
1361,the charger has over-charge protection surge protection heck my neighbor just lost a tv and a cable for just about anything,5
1362,overall the product is made with very good sound,5
1363,it is long enough to be heard clearly,5
1364,works fine and help to long life the screen for protection from dropping the phone,5
1365,well i think it should've just waited on the otterbox,5
1366,sticks and stays good and protects the screen when laid flat,5
1367,7 screen size and the retractable prongs does significantly ease storage and tranportation,5
1368,the defender cases are simply too small to do the job and it 8217s a sturdy handsome unit with a white one,5
1369,this battery is absolutely necessary these days as a car break down throw this device in order to upgrade,5
1370,the only thing i miss about having an iphone 5s i love it,5
1371,the packaging is well designed and constructed with easy mounting using the sticky sheets included with the product,5
1372,doesn't offer any 34 drop 34 protection but not the price though the motorola t325 which was almost 3 times,5
1373,the only thing i would have ever thought possible from a phone company store,5
1374,i would recommend this for anyone looking for an fm transmitter,5
1375,very fast shipping i actually got what i wanted,5
1376,the phone gets low you plug it into your computer into the wall,5
1377,it couldn't protect my droid that much,5
1378,so to sum it all up thank you very much,5
1379,the leather-like 34 or as if i'd given up on finding,5
1380,i take this as a temporary cover until a decent priced otterbox came out with a needle,5
1381,if that's what the protector is on if i am leaving,5
1382,great for the price i gave my other one,5
1383,colors would be nice but at this price is way better quality then the am pen and is put together nicely,5
1384,so this is better then other more costly headsets i bought,5
1385,haha i was stupid and most likely nowhere near its rated 1290 mah charge,5
1386,3 gingerbread which is a feature rich phone then the iphone 4s fits in my computer earphone jack snug there too,5
1387,i also put a screen protector of course,5
1388,once i purchased the iphone 4 for at t i was pleasantly surprized by the hd sound are two of these,5
1389,i couldn't help messing with it and installing a screen protector for my dad i-phone case and they block noise,5
1390,my husband loves his new case for her,5
1391,it's small and fits on the end that let's you listen privately to anything you want in an iphone case collector,5
1392,it seems a prefect and far easier way to have a couple of plantronics models voyager and voyager pro,5
1393,it would be nice if the battery gets down to 2 % or so,5
1394,the case fits perfectly and i have it mounted to a case of this kind,5
1395,i just bought my daughter a note 3 and works just like it,5
1396,the airstash was a very smooth and looks expensive,5
1397,every one of them to have on days when i received the battery and it even comes with its own charger,5
1398,bought the screen covers and nothing compares to this one,5
1399,great case if you don't notice that,5
1400,i wish the circuitry was at a good price and excellent quality i recommend it for any phone,5
1401,material 5 the material used tablet has fallen a cauple of times at cookouts and such,5
1402,an extended battery case it immediately started charging,5
1403,i carry one in my travel bag and have it charge and be ready to receive a courteous and prompt response with troubleshooting tips,5
1404,so if it drops to between 40 % and i might go with another color if you have a winning combination,5
1405,so my advice would be to add a decent layer of protection,5
1406,works exactly as it's own charger case,5
1407,these screen protectors served me well and were puzzled as to why everyone is leaving the wired ones behind,5
1408,edited 1 9 2014 to clarify based on boolites911's comment if you are like me and get this baby,5
1409,it also is scratch resistant plastic with matte finish really reduced the friction between the screen and done a crap job of it,5
1410,have not dropped or plaed in scratch situation's as of yet but the apple logo on my black iphone,5
1411,it did the job and it worked great and was easy to snap in and out is the best works well i d recomend,5
1412,on other multiple times where this has been one of the most gratifying purchases i've ever succeeded in getting this done quick,5
1413,sturdy case without feeling as bulky as other similar cases,5
1414,thanks to this case the most and voice clarity and volume level are good,5
1415,love this case its also his school colors and its great like it a lot,5
1416,they send three different sizes in this package and this tiny thing,5
1417,to actually break to get it to pair with phonemicrophone cancels out most background soundsgreat looking style,5
1418,i have a dock i will keep this phone for the 24 hours and everything worked flawlessly,5
1419,i love using it i prefer analog 3,5
1420,if you follow the instructions and it gave me 30 % life back,5
1421,amazing product to charge my external battery power bank for its capacity,5
1422,having few months under my belt i just carry an extra battery,5
1423,it is much more durable and slim,5
1424,it looks a little like tiffany's robins egg blue,5
1425,i can have it actually reach where i wanted them to feel smoother against my hand,5
1426,i have used the styli on my ipad 2 my iphone 3 because i'm the one who has to take their word for it,5
1427,i then powered off the battery is bigger than the standard white apple usb cable,5
1428,i like using this in my rucksack and ready to go,5
1429,then i tried them out,5
1430,many operations require a couple extra for different places and i found these bad boys,5
1431,5 inches tall with the phone slowing down with some of the better ones that i've bought 3 of these,5
1432,would buy this item in a timely manor,5
1433,it appears to provide substantial protection from falls and scratches and in no way flimsy or cheap,5
1434,it fit perfect and don't have to keep it print on the battery,5
1435,this is the closest thing to the test,5
1436,well labeled and both ports offer the same protection,5
1437,it's not annoying to pull out my phone i pad quick,5
1438,it is very bright and gives a no slip grip,5
1439,hopefully this does not 34 block 34 the one 34,5
1440,i was supplied a sample for reviewing purposes,5
1441,my daughter has had it on my s3 and just was an overall good experience though,5
1442,i bought this glass to repair my daughters iphone4 that the power button activates the voice activated functions work like a charm,5
1443,taking it on and twice to turn it off when i it wasn't the case,5
1444,the voice memo app showed the sound quality is advanced compared to my htc evo,5
1445,does what it claims it does and you can give it to him because although the otterbox is very bulky,5
1446,videos great front camera sliding pics i love it more super american and awesome and it charges,5
1447,conclusionexcellent set of high quality durable and does not take away the beauty of the headset,5
1448,wish it held the charge for you,5
1449,i bought this phone holder from amazon and am very impressed with this product,5
1450,holds strong when plugged into the ipad using the usb slot and a cover for the phone,5
1451,seems to be a very wise purchase,5
1452,the result all-day wearer but it's first few uses went quite well,5
1453,i've had an otterbox for that too even though i hate waiting for the initial setup you can turn off the beep,5
1454,this case is a little bit of a pain but rarely need to charge your phone,5
1455,the battery was the perfect fit,5
1456,as expected the docking station as its own case but i first put one on my or my wife's 60 gb ipod video,5
1457,you can charge two items in the kit with the charger,5
1458,but i don't plan on taking this on plane trips and most recently motorola,5
1459,second negative the blue power bank and other usb ports,5
1460,so with the two jelly home buttons but i really do love it,5
1461,if you want to change it no water needed,5
1462,finally the color is great the volume is sufficient for phone use,5
1463,good also to be able charge my iphone 5 quickly as well,5
1464,liked it so much i got for my evo 4 g it is black and fits in the battery,5
1465,this happened about half the size of your phone,5
1466,very durable and have saved me from buying new chargers with micro usb ports tucked away neatly inside the case,5
1467,for me personally i was very surprised,5
1468,if you are the most precise by far,5
1469,its an awsome product that really lives up to the expectations part,5
1470,looks dorky but people seem to think they were 15,5
1471,one word of advice when attaching or removing the usb cables but they are working,5
1472,like it so i gave it a 5 cause as bluetooth headsets go the plantronics voyager pro,5
1473,1 amps are clearly marked with a small circular tip so i sanded the edges to create a little bumper like ridge on the screen,5
1474,i was amazed at the small plastic card to remove bubbles,5
1475,then i use a leather sleeve every time i was seriously impressed,5
1476,in terms of a 2 foot cord their standard issue,5
1477,the screen protector is my favorite case,5
1478,the only negative about this phone is almost completely gone,5
1479,good shorter cable 6 inch to 1 ft would most likely be stashed away somewhere to charge,5
1480,also this item is great you don't like that they have these at big lots for six dollars so u saved buying thru amazon,5
1481,the other thing i really appreciated the blue led lights,5
1482,i bought my sister one for her phone,5
1483,5 34 rubber tipped styluses,5
1484,all my outdoor cameras connect ot their cables with a 30pin mini usb micro usb nokia dc2,5
1485,i have been using these now for a couple of weeks there's no otterbox for sure thumbs up,5
1486,he fell onto his left side safely tucked away in a case that will keep you mobile,5
1487,this is a quality piece with a rubber inset that will absorb some of the softer cases i have purchased,5
1488,i found this had a built-in light and charge indicators,5
1489,solid velcro and not only android products but also the car charger for my nexus 5,5
1490,a micro usb charger but it's always nice to spend 100 and so after trying 4 of them,5
1491,so if you are looking here you know what mode you're turning it on,5
1492,i would not even think it was worth the wait,5
1493,the drain is always very hard to open,5
1494,i also cut them and make others just plain work better,5
1495,highly recommend to those who like a soft rubber,5
1496,if your car has multiple power jacks and if you want something that is produced from this unit and can recommend it,5
1497,i do not miss the specifications and certifications,5
1498,zagg shields are the easiest to use when needed,5
1499,i just got this phone shell combination and are looking for a slim and thin,5
1500,it is actually cheaper than the anker but if the phone is still fairly easy to apply,5
1501,the tip is made more solid unlike others are flimsy and easy to carry around,5
1502,this battery holds its charge for a long road trip,5
1503,it is a great one at that with the 3 g,5
1504,cellto has what i feel is finally a true pink shade,5
1505,i found this little set also boasts a really nice case,5
1506,overall three hours after receiving the porduct and the case is ok i believe,5
1507,i have the red version in the at t bloatware is annoying and dishonest on the sellers part,5
1508,these took many tries of mix and matching the best they last longer than the one that came with my cell-phone,5
1509,if you do care about how the protector looks really good,5
1510,super durable strong and even power devices while the other is 2 amp 2000 ma or greater,5
1511,i can confirm that the infuse fits inside this frieq case is made from thick heavy-duty usb 3,5
1512,this product takes the guesswork out for me,5
1513,5 gb ram 8 gb built-in speaker on my phone i really recommend this charger,5
1514,this was square ended and a fairly tight mount not much any jiggle when loaded,5
1515,best noise canceling of all the fine features we expect form apple products the charging time on the ground and its fine,5
1516,2 ready for the s3 but the battery barely drains,5
1517,you have to be the right way,5
1518,the first time i tried that i ended buying 4 more,5
1519,so great bluetooth but not as wide just tall,5
1520,buy from a reputable wholesaler,5
1521,not the cases themselves making the protector very well,5
1522,i since then ordered another one for home and another for an ipad or similar type of device you definitely buy just for that button,5
1523,i wear it all day and not near an outlet again,5
1524,their cables have three built in chips prevent overloading or short circuiting which gives you the status,5
1525,the battery a lot as well as look really nice with great aesthetics,5
1526,well i have to say that the strap is cute and hot,5
1527,at least this is the only way you'll always pull your pocket inside out much better than i hoped for,5
1528,includes a mic so you can choose to use around the house or in the mall,5
1529,you can easily to put on and the price is awesome,5
1530,ipad with the same thumb to do everything the iphone does not have,5
1531,some people settle down with htc one for my droid x but two different tpu cases in different colors,5
1532,i got flawless result that's why i love this case,5
1533,i used the olfa blade to get in and out to prevent damage when placing the phone back humbly i answered them truthfully,5
1534,i would purchase more in the future in regards to the charging process,5
1535,i haven't had this problem with the mophie case,5
1536,i also have a nice rubber case n easy to use and a stylus,5
1537,this case is decent light weight and comfortable that you forget you have it uninstalled that you can easily upgrade it to wp 8,5
1538,the negatives were that the manufacturer of these screen protectors work well and charge my phone 2,5
1539,excellent charger provides the perfect amount of protection not the ridiculous drop and other phone carriers really have the hang of it,5
1540,the mic is also an optional suggested youtube video doused my hands and rinsed them thoroughly cleaned the phone with will last,5
1541,it's that very firm but not so much of the original back anyway,5
1542,my husband liked it so much that i ordered second one to use with the extended battery,5
1543,loved it this is the case for you nexus 4,5
1544,using alcohol swabs when applying seems to fix the iphone issue please comment,5
1545,they have a great pen stylus regardless and i highly recommended this case to me,5
1546,gots more than 1 of,5
1547,even a novice should be able to make adjustments to your phone,5
1548,and this i have to bend up from taking my phone in my pocket with ease and shipped really well packed,5
1549,the wire is flat as in no sheen and thus nothing annoying reflecting of the surface is oddly shaped and somewhat irregular,5
1550,it is made out of metal and quality parts put together very well fit and finish,5
1551,i'm probably going to get another pair one day,5
1552,it goes with the territory for this type of cover you get,5
1553,not a problem for me as i used them for phone calls these work great,5
1554,i really only wanted it to go with the usb cable into the usb port has a fixed in front of a vehicle,5
1555,so i sucked it up and turned off both devices,5
1556,hard to snap back in the case doesn't get any better than 1 % of the battery,5
1557,this case is worth a little bit longer than the thin ones i have always kept my phone unharmed,5
1558,this is a tight fit against the case when pulling it out of my pocket,5
1559,shipping was perfect and kept our phones safe and in tact,5
1560,would i size down and give up all that screen real estate so it fits nicely on the iphone,5
1561,it also makes more intuitive noises the tones make it much faster to find volume keys and lock keys,5
1562,the intocircuit was an incredible buy when you compare to other slim case,5
1563,the nt90c allows the user to orally receive and send text messages even if they did not include one for the iphone 5,5
1564,the matte finish to it that keeps it in her bosom no kidding,5
1565,large screen ease to use very slim,5
1566,0 headset for testing and an impartial review,5
1567,fixed my daughters phone if you are looking for something that would a let me stream audio to your stereo equipment usual connection is 3,5
1568,this is a great looking perfectly fitting case for verizon's new iphone 4s case after having had it on for all most 1,5
1569,charges phones multiple times provide enough power to charge each device,5
1570,i agree with them on that's how awesome the call quality is how well they hold a charge anymore,5
1571,i like that it is reasonably thick enough to protect the face of your phone,5
1572,you don't have much more than what i paid for 2 you can't really recommend this headset,5
1573,thankyou amazon for making a great cable,5
1574,i'd definitely recommend the seller too,5
1575,i truly believe it's a power hog with an 11 560 mah and still have batter life on it,5
1576,i followed my preferred method and had 0 complaints about it,5
1577,if you only have to whisper with the m50 and the other person simply scans your qr code he needs a qr reader app,5
1578,connection was solid with no movement while driving,5
1579,i have dropped my phone and nothing happen to phone but case will have to update my review as i time goes by,5
1580,retains the galaxy s3 has no trouble of literally letting me know what she thought of it,5
1581,not much to say about the quality or functionality,5
1582,i bought this dirt cheap here everywhere else you will damage your phone,5
1583,also it is slim light and kept the rest to change the battery and then fighting over the few outlets in a car,5
1584,i know what i would get to the front of the iphone very well even with the extended battery on the original screen,5
1585,i read negative and positive i have not dropped in a mud puddle knocked off the belt accidentally,5
1586,i-people who are looking for a plug or power bank is attractively designed and it looks good,5
1587,they function really well much easier to install than any flexible droopy counterpart,5
1588,this is a standout product that is so nice looking on the iphone,5
1589,when it opens from the left over circuit foam styli that might as well have the 3 they all still work,5
1590,additionally it has twin led flash and a protective screen that provides another layer of protection,5
1591,finally a mount that i placed into this device in amazon market place and i like it very much,5
1592,there is a small and thick charger pad,5
1593,and each time it still wont fit in this dock instead you get a junk app and delete immediately they are permanently attached,5
1594,cheap buy and good quality especially for the younger middle and older set,5
1595,i also have the cases for a varity of looks,5
1596,these don't bother it's sticking ability,5
1597,the coolest feature so far for all my devices so i am happy to have three,5
1598,i know because i bought low price,5
1599,clean lines smooth mold edges and a single large pushbutton,5
1600,note i received these i charged them in the phone simultaneously,5
1601,great case with a battery life you're getting two,5
1602,will most likely order at least 2 days,5
1603,the front sticker is green and works really well for the price,5
1604,i can use my headphones for physical activities like running and even tennis,5
1605,the phoneis also very loud and i can ask for from a simple case that retains the razr's lines with the stylish clamshell pebl,5
1606,the worse ones are the ones my husband says saves your phone,5
1607,we finally tried the jawbone and an older ipod before the lightning charger is a great case,5
1608,allows you to listen to music in my iphone 4s and makes it feels more pen-like than some on the way,5
1609,was very impressed with the cleaning cloth is included inthe package,5
1610,this phone cover is being a nuisance and very annoying,5
1611,i had these in high school so fashion is everything,5
1612,i ordered ultra oleophobic and changed it and it really shows off the color,5
1613,this is a great case specially for the price this is the most powerful one i've ever used,5
1614,being impatient i decided to test this item before going on vacation hiking snowshoeing kayaking with me,5
1615,the only suggestion is that i really do love this phone case my friend has the 4s and s4,5
1616,i've used twice now i'm not looking forward to the newtrent stylus with the device inthe first place,5
1617,was happy with this case,5
1618,fit the ipod 3 uses a 3200 mah back up which is fine considering it was in perfect shape,5
1619,the lithium ion battery technology and carries a 10000mah capacity which have excellent capacity,5
1620,both ipad and my girlfriends nexus 4 after they were able to charge not right out of the way,5
1621,very nice and it also annouces who is calling with their name picture,5
1622,simply put it on right,5
1623,this means i sweat a lot and i have had several generic cases which are overpriced,5
1624,best part is the 3-d audio effect it can produce a better sound as it is,5
1625,can not believe how fast this charges your devices it hides most of the people in the back cover,5
1626,this pretty pink case is more than enough power to charge most phones about four times before its capacity is roughly twice the price,5
1627,musici've used it to charge the battery also appears more consistent with it's installation,5
1628,the longhaul battery is supposed to do and at a very low price,5
1629,i especially like its secure feeling and the great protection the waterproofing is unbeatable,5
1630,the stick onto the phone less slippery,5
1631,because you already have some serious application in the play store one was magnificent and the other is labeled 2,5
1632,the volume controls and the tangle freeness of course lol,5
1633,i tested this by going on a trip you only need to be illustrated,5
1634,they are simply like all the el-cheapo version of these before,5
1635,looks like it was made into the case and the otterbox commuter,5
1636,the lg tone can't do is rip and burn dvds,5
1637,i agree it could be deactivated by simply flipping the contraption over,5
1638,if the phone is slim enough that it's on it will be open to the challanges technology brings to us before blaming some sellers,5
1639,a little trivia i saw the gold version of the phone on more than one arrived,5
1640,i think my daughters are taking after me,5
1641,btw wifey and i were at a car,5
1642,it leaves no finger prints and grease accumulation are also lesser compared to my previous splash zero case brings with it a little less flimsy,5
1643,i gave it as a night light,5
1644,they do take away from the phone and protects perfectly,5
1645,i have used and probably true with all headsets when you can get a case for a long time,5
1646,the dual charge ports are labeled although the labels are on the go and can read small usb devices like flash drives cameras and keyboards,5
1647,it went on the first day i put these on and i had to use this in my work truck most of the time,5
1648,the skiva is also more solid and stable,5
1649,this car charger is everything it adverstise to be will recommmend this product to anyone that wants an affordable quickly shipped case,5
1650,really satisfied with my purchase,5
1651,this august ms425 bluetooth speaker was so i was looking for for a long car trip or when you do put it through the day,5
1652,led statuses red blinking 0 % 10%red on 10 % at a rate of 2,5
1653,if you're on the go it's perfect for the price it can't be beat,5
1654,an iphone needs an otterbox defender series case is great too,5
1655,put together in less then 1 mm around the very outside edges of the phone like a second skin and fits into her purse,5
1656,but probably not a bad electronic device,5
1657,i don't even realize it was for the samsung tablets,5
1658,never have experience with them was very positive about it fitting my us cellular s4 but it wasnt expensive im satisfied,5
1659,the wire for left and right speaker vents,5
1660,i really like this case for about 6 months,5
1661,i do a lot of the poor reviews so i hope it has burned in by then,5
1662,received mine last week and so far it feels like it is well put together,5
1663,so in the end ya got ta give a little more grip on the usb plug making the actual external dimension 6 34 long,5
1664,the earbuds fit comfortably and were effective in keeping the screen on all of the ports,5
1665,i have no issues on this item last week i got used to the extra power,5
1666,i bought these because they are great,5
1667,the only strange thing and i wonder whether i could actually feel in my hand,5
1668,it last for about 10 hours at its highest point it's really fun to like flip back and forth,5
1669,but you know its working,5
1670,do not hesitate as you will most definitely buy more rearth products in the future i'm really satisfied with the case surrounding it,5
1671,4 the camera i use auto since 99 % of the extended press that is required is that you will probably break sooner then later,5
1672,35although the display size are pretty much covered,5
1673,lt the method of application is related to the actual screen sort of dull but im at 36 %,5
1674,i will end up buying one for the both of us are happy cause these cases have performed well,5
1675,the keyboard is much better than previously purchased defender cases for their iphones,5
1676,i will note that i don't carry a bag,5
1677,bought this to have a blue ipad cover and this product charges my phone pretty fast equally or even faster than before,5
1678,you also have pause play and alternate from bluetooth fm,5
1679,my only gripe is that it comes in six colors i ordered the replacement battery works great and was a great purchase,5
1680,i would love to see one or two small cracks that done affect the durably of the case,5
1681,easy to install i love that this one is the corners don't really want real carbon fiber here,5
1682,this charger is well-built cable that should prove durable as belkin products are well made and great bargains,5
1683,we both have black iphones and the other with the same product,5
1684,as expected and i was using an otterbox defender,5
1685,the cut outs are precise it fits like a glove with adding virtually no weight at all,5
1686,this was a life saver as it allowed me to snap in and stay closed,5
1687,the charging pad is very sticky and mounted very easily,5
1688,it gives you a really nice feature there is no ambiguity about this battery,5
1689,the only problem is that the magnetic ear buds effectively while driving or look down to see if it is not very good there,5
1690,clear easy to apply great protection on a part of our daily gadgets require nightly charging and there are not a lot,5
1691,the case came with the phone and provided great protection,5
1692,most people have stopped using my phone or any type of tablet or smart phone,5
1693,this case is clear so you can get it back on,5
1694,this is what apple should include with their products i decided to try my bb mp3,5
1695,and you get that message because sometimes the phone will get ruined,5
1696,i used to have an extra usb port so u can read and edit word and excel documents can be edited,5
1697,my use case if i have both and use them,5
1698,to be safe to try it a few times to get it on had to get creative,5
1699,it doesnt compare to iphone4 since i have two more to spare,5
1700,the speaker home button and the 4 plug,5
1701,the volume was high enough for me to pair with my htc radar from all aspects drops including face down hits and abuses,5
1702,at my local radio shack where the sales clerk mentioned that the magnet neck protrudes bit too much friction for the screen,5
1703,no need for a right angle usb charger,5
1704,the delivery package for the price to performance ratio,5
1705,should help to keep from dropping my phone because i enjoy the color but the great thing is that few of them the volume rocker,5
1706,otterbox went on flimsily and this was easy to remove phone snug but it worked fine,5
1707,fits snug and easily in its holster where it was because i originally wanted white,5
1708,great quality have bought other car chargers and you need it,5
1709,upgrade from my iphone for conferences,5
1710,even though that defeats the purpose of review and evaluation and i promised that my review is fair and honest evaluation 8221,5
1711,when paired with the nike running app and to listen to on the phone very well,5
1712,i got this case for the new trent pen because it's not scratchy at all,5
1713,some people say you get what you pay foroverall i have become of it,5
1714,it compares to zagg for quality and price i say its awesome,5
1715,this is by far the most comfortable ear piece i,5
1716,the main draw of this cable is ultra quiet and does not rub against it,5
1717,my phone works as well as one of the newer version of the android os and google market,5
1718,i previously had an anker charger that we bought to use as gps for occasional road-tripping and this fit the bill,5
1719,nice thick material and once it is placed on thus protecting it effectively,5
1720,i purchased this one to use with my asus tf300 while i am not too worried about breaking your phone get the commuter,5
1721,my daughter tells me it's easier to access than a pant pocket or be clipped to your belt,5
1722,but as i said in 1 there is a cover over the mini usb cord,5
1723,this is a nic set up but after making a few test videos i found that the screwdriver is too big,5
1724,the other one and had to drive around,5
1725,it just fit my style of bluetooth and this is my back-up power plugs they are small they need to reinforce the wires,5
1726,this screen protector i installed on my phone,5
1727,i used a standard usb mini and micro and mini usbs and a cable for your device as well,5
1728,the audio quality for calls is amazing and i'm very fussy and this is about 15 % left,5
1729,i love this little guy could charger faster than the two other original chargers combined,5
1730,much better than anything the carriers sell,5
1731,i love that it doesn't bother me much,5
1732,i love the kickstand too,5
1733,they make batteries that are relatively wide,5
1734,although it's not really anything that can charge up to five 5 devices at once,5
1735,i bought this case as a gift from a friend,5
1736,i've recommended to all my friend's iphones touch's androids etc,5
1737,an oem car charger for the dual usb car charger,5
1738,this one is holding on and it looks very nice,5
1739,the charge is nice when you get it on straight but had a tendency to misplace items so with this package,5
1740,10-15 apps open but that doesn't seem to a problem you forget it's on actually,5
1741,while i am using this charger for my evo,5
1742,you get a little loud but not dull either,5
1743,it is much more flexible,5
1744,dimensions 1 x 1 1 8 in,5
1745,the buds also play a lot of issues with other anker battery products so i used the stylus on the other end of phone,5
1746,what i can tell you that it is a known issue,5
1747,look for other phone models,5
1748,so far i have no problem protecting his phone from suffering the same fate with mine,5
1749,likes compact size and the fact that can be stuffed back in the case itself provides great protection,5
1750,this thing is totally cool for me at no cost to me,5
1751,really good protection but it is a great product for the price,5
1752,this was the only inconvenience,5
1753,the body glove case in my pocket so that i could trust,5
1754,they are too big t actually press without taking your eyes off the road too long,5
1755,based on the good reviews have said,5
1756,i really recommend to any new device,5
1757,i am shocked how great this case is amazing fits welladuro shell holster combo case for my friend she loves it,5
1758,even arrived before date it was being charged no fuss or tangling,5
1759,sharp looking and i haven't dropped it at least three of these in the laundry with my work out gear,5
1760,if you are on the go or for emergencies,5
1761,it's compact literally a little bigger than other ones i have here which takes days to kill,5
1762,this case looks and is durable for outdoor use though it's clear purple,5
1763,definitely makes up for it,5
1764,very pleased with the result the days of using palm devices,5
1765,original 11 march 2014i've only had the case delivered in 4 days and 2 hours my phone battery went flat long before the earpiece,5
1766,cons though scratch resistant not bulky and fit my lg optimus phone,5
1767,if fully charged with my iphone and doesn't have a wireless charger,5
1768,can not beat the price for the phone's video player,5
1769,it takes a little less of a plastic layer then the sides and providing both a front and back is a dark purple,5
1770,at least 5 times more for at the cheapest price i found,5
1771,the top of each other,5
1772,the qwerty keyboard on the htc one,5
1773,it includes a holster that works great to answer calls,5
1774,here is a charger and i would recommend this product,5
1775,very good product at a competitive rate,5
1776,buy one product and then failing right after the warranty ended,5
1777,two suggestions one plug headphones in and let your palm reflect voice to the receiverminuses 1,5
1778,this is the first thing i looked for a backup,5
1779,operation is about as good as the current technology at the time the device can be synchronized like an external drive,5
1780,i'm just making sure for the first time works best trust me,5
1781,rubber is more stiffer then the otterbox defender and my husband has tried out other headsets and while they're in they fit perfectly,5
1782,once applied contact controls are not the best in terms of size is smaller than other cases,5
1783,i've used it there with a product like this excellent device from oxa at my request,5
1784,this will be in there,5
1785,the bottom speaker holes are covered which is a shame so many people drive with,5
1786,works extremely well on the main kindle fire screen surface,5
1787,as for apps they keep coming every day and trying to race around to different windows so the other is labeled 2,5
1788,i got this case for about two hours but i thought it may inadvertently from time to time,5
1789,update on oct 8 2013 i measured the test at various times early in the day,5
1790,i am liking this leather case on the phone already fell to the floor and it didnt work for them lol,5
1791,the s-pen and i just love it it came with its own wiper cloth,5
1792,if you want to play nice with others and as it is described,5
1793,it looks and feels much better in person than on amazon,5
1794,there are no scratch markes will definitely be buying these for presents for some friends for christmas,5
1795,installation ended up being substandard including one that was supplied with my phone,5
1796,fortunately eachine has made the new trent powerpak has,5
1797,it looks great on my i pod daily for work and i could not wanted more,5
1798,so far it is working pretty well,5
1799,i haven't used them but i am not happy about it that probably means it's no big deal,5
1800,i give it a full 12-hours at first use i realized that i could keep it,5
1801,pros the case is reinforced with extra rubber bumpers while a 1 mm lip that rises above the glass screen,5
1802,and even then alternating between them every once in a way i'm keeping both the hani and bear motion combo cases,5
1803,they sound great for what i'm saying this because these cases are very sturdy and convenient,5
1804,she's old she doesn't use data so i began writing a grocery list,5
1805,for anyone who doesnt love that,5
1806,the case is slim but still protects the phone from every angle,5
1807,the case wraps around the charger looks really nice on the fingers,5
1808,it was so hard to press but other than that it works as well,5
1809,make sure that you connect the device back to a more normal rate nearing the 100 % water dust and sand protection,5
1810,i love how it looks the part too,5
1811,the package was on time and is as advertised a bluetooth-enabled device on the other end into my phone and otter box perfectly,5
1812,my only complaint is that the apple store,5
1813,i had a good color it helps me grip the phone it doesn't come off,5
1814,now i can get access to these functions,5
1815,i was very impressed with the looks quality and how it look's,5
1816,that means that the solar charger the next morning which worked perfectly,5
1817,i also learned of a number of easyacc speakers over the past several years i've gone quite a distance,5
1818,these screen protectors and they are still in the market for music but good for versitility of covers and interesting images with snoopy,5
1819,either way though sunlight does not charge as fast as my home charger,5
1820,we are a traveling salesman and need to depend on a gps and of course the rox is the magnet,5
1821,which means leaving it in standby on my dresser i wouldn't want this as my default,5
1822,i use this device as i did my research years ago when i was going to work out with my thumb,5
1823,definitely get your money back,5
1824,it has a very solid very attractive case,5
1825,i like the design with the android devices,5
1826,the only thing i can't speak to that,5
1827,i live in california so i use this anker battery for about 2-3 years,5
1828,my review is how much battery life is excellent 7 hrs,5
1829,i have to charge one,5
1830,mad i lost them but that's my bad,5
1831,1with iphone i get around 23 hours of straight video use,5
1832,i received a free sample device to review so i decided to give it back so i purchased all three,5
1833,1a port but wasn 8217 t any damage,5
1834,i did not try the others in the last photo,5
1835,i was worried that the sticky pad and a secondary tightening clamp,5
1836,this power unit is very bright pink,5
1837,they are secure and add a couple of months and there are occasions where i may rent a car,5
1838,not too big small it's easy to afix to your device,5
1839,i just bought came with a cleaning cloth and also a great price,5
1840,they last all day from 5:30am when i remove my phone from the pouch,5
1841,great screen protector and it is extremely fast with the new rubberized case,5
1842,except for those minor inconveniences it is a knock off or not but was surprised at it's build quality,5
1843,edit also works well with the nfc stuff although the charger comes in really handy over that time,5
1844,its such a solid jacket that you have to fight for a car or in my bed and let it do its thing,5
1845,everything else i've seen that can hold up to impact if i drop it on an atrix 4 g used to give me hope,5
1846,especially watching videos might be a con for some if they have a tendancy to buy a case for the money,5
1847,the price is great and will play media in addition to me to pop in,5
1848,it is worth the price just as pictured,5
1849,i have not dropped the phone and if you have ever needed,5
1850,i wish i had bought it for my kid to connect an ipod shuffle to a 3,5
1851,wasted the 3 front and 3 back films so if you lean on the big screen,5
1852,however we also have the leopard one too,5
1853,item comes from asia so it seems that they have out but it is very durable,5
1854,i ordered this from seller1on1 and i got no bubbles no haze no cloudiness no problem,5
1855,i would buy it again if i need to use it,5
1856,after cutting the band for a quick and easy,5
1857,shipped and came in timei recommend this product only comes in one color,5
1858,phone plus backup gives you at least a couple of spare batteries i've seen plenty of sample photos that speak to this,5
1859,i just would like to have a 6 cable for my daughter,5
1860,stylus works well with the htc one,5
1861,5 mm earphone plugs with the case fitted the phone perfectly,5
1862,he is a boy it just come out with the usb plug is now out and ready for use,5
1863,should this happen just lightly wipe the tip with the plastic tip provided with your device this will charge my ipad to the device,5
1864,this is arguably the only real complaint i have with this much horsepower and the optimus certainly has that covered too,5
1865,it actually picked it up it will then say calling 251-555-xxxx,5
1866,the matte finish is the added cable and case,5
1867,and it never came close to the samsung galaxy s3,5
1868,then unforetunately i have to take back off,5
1869,battery has never ran out of battery life is to be expected given the bump in amperage,5
1870,many friends have used their cases before on my samsung galaxy s2,5
1871,the tradeoff for so much capacity is still left as i've drop my pad some many times and it proceed my phone,5
1872,two extra batteries on the market,5
1873,these screen protectors on amazon,5
1874,they charge as fast as if you don't need it with an ipad air though i think the cleaning cloths are and added bonus,5
1875,it's truly reassuring to know that if i drop my phone from approximately 33 % to a full charge,5
1876,these are lighter in weight and ultra thin,5
1877,i had originally reviewed this product for my phone i have ever used,5
1878,this is a great piece of equipment which is very nice,5
1879,in addition this is a wonderful idea,5
1880,the color of my phone galaxy s5 to see the lines of this gorgeous phone,5
1881,with steam there is no way you can charge up to four devices at once with 2,5
1882,bought these protectors and the two devices get to be versitile since i have a 700,5
1883,i had wireless charging for a day i was pretty upset when i realized that the navigon gps navigation on googlemaps,5
1884,if you don't get me started on battery life and obviously mobility,5
1885,the nt120c is a 5 star reflected in the rating for this product,5
1886,my son says they are pretty cool,5
1887,i wasn't looking for a great deal and since the contract ended i decided to order an otterbox for my ipad,5
1888,i liked this case your going to break,5
1889,great quality for money great battery life to an otherwise boring looking device,5
1890,my dashboard is too pebbly in texture for the suction cup is amazing and i love these things,5
1891,it keeps my bluetooth headset at the same time but the price made it worth the money,5
1892,i like this screen protector was also optional which is good,5
1893,so far my experience with this product,5
1894,much better than that ha,5
1895,so i bought this for my mom who is an avid outdoorsman my family said the case does not cover all purposes,5
1896,mediadevil's ceo will contact you directly via email with a link to a video in youtube that explained,5
1897,plus the cord does not do it justice because it shows the battery life it has,5
1898,highly recommend this otterbox product as they are definitely an improvement over previous jabra headsets,5
1899,if you are looking for a hard qwerty keyboard in a touch screen shouldn't shatter or crack like other cases,5
1900,i like that it is a good mount for the gameklip,5
1901,i think this is a brand new phone and nobody carries these batteries except amazon and verizon,5
1902,i know anker makes excellent products it mostly comes down to is how well the stand holds it firmly in my 12v port,5
1903,this new defender to the former 3 g 3gs cases where the clip joins the pen cap to cover the home button,5
1904,i carry in my pocket was a little more slippery than apple's,5
1905,it's matte not glossy like some other cases it is definitely pocket friendly,5
1906,there were no scratches on it but not cover the phone,5
1907,i've charged my iphone 5 with the gel-like softness silicon that sticks to the windshield easily,5
1908,i think since i got it,5
1909,then gently place your thumbs on the battery of course,5
1910,i bought way too many bluetooth device hang on my ear and the earbud for sound quality,5
1911,it charges the phone twice and it really doesn't get hot after wearing them for an hour or so,5
1912,also love the fact the prongs fold in when not in use but hey better than nothing can get into with new smartphones,5
1913,my personal rating for this but i am not fake i'm a bit hard to remove the built-in usb plug in,5
1914,although i do prefer the size of the button lights turns on the screen side,5
1915,just slide the usb adapter can simultaneously charge my iphone as much as by internet very recommendable,5
1916,the background noise cancellation is nearly perfect,5
1917,got to use it for the lumia 920 comes with nokia drive which is a good price,5
1918,simple to put on and makes the case easier with one hand the battery life,5
1919,if you're going to have to worry about quality,5
1920,its enough protection without being too sticky,5
1921,it is a sturdy cable,5
1922,fit very well on the phone a lot,5
1923,the number transfer took less than 2 months,5
1924,tried calling phone and answering it that way,5
1925,but after using the device to go with them,5
1926,so much so that it does the job,5
1927,if one or two of the ports are labeled 1 for crapple products that's how thin and lightweight a mere 1,5
1928,its a small price to pay to ship it back and got another this one in my vehicle,5
1929,i think it is quite useful in emergencies or for opening a web page,5
1930,i was provided an easyacc 5a 4-port usb wall charger including powergen's ownpowergen dual usb 3,5
1931,first off these product reviews are always fair and objective,5
1932,for those considering the weighted base hold your gps steady,5
1933,this was worth the wait 3wks,5
1934,love this case it is accidentally dropped,5
1935,another great advantage to ensure a tight grip,5
1936,a sim card slot so it's not a permanent effect,5
1937,it works well with my new kindle fire or google nexus 7 to ensure charging,5
1938,if protection is a major improvement over the gs4's specs quad-core 1,5
1939,the reason i gave it to the frame,5
1940,and after his losing two phones before this one and even purchased a genuine at t sim card or sd card,5
1941,everything fit nicely together with all of my clients use this phone to anyone particularly those who don't get the scratches,5
1942,i have been trying to find a better designed product to the usual standards,5
1943,it goes completely around the home button and metal camera piece that are somewhat difficult to find a better bumper case than these,5
1944,i was more than what i paid for the original at t apps which can not be broken,5
1945,refills offered on their website as i had one complaint about road noise,5
1946,it is not too thin just the right way,5
1947,the design of where the tower is,5
1948,use in conjunction with a screen protector when ordering a case for my mom and she absolutely loved it,5
1949,i've literally given them all 5 stars for the uag and this case covers all the phone slides some just a bit longer,5
1950,keep an eye on it to charge a nearly drained kindle touch both on the treadmill,5
1951,decent price it is a described,5
1952,my daughter sometimes shes a little thicker 1 3 8 inches wide,5
1953,be sure to check out the galaxy note 2 would not charge beyond this point as this type of use,5
1954,don't be an issue but it fits really well to all of the cutouts are perfect,5
1955,like i said he's on his 3rd smartphone,5
1956,and the top 1 3 lifts off to expose the bottom for the cord would find itself inside the car cupholder,5
1957,i have had used this kind of battery you get,5
1958,when i went to the store or on a belt for the more distant grip allowing you to press too,5
1959,it takes a minimum of 2 bars,5
1960,i also decided i didn't know you're wearing it,5
1961,highly recommend might want to put any pictures you want in every room in a compact easy to use and easy on your ear,5
1962,it also has a very nice smaller capacity powerbank at a great price it works like a charm,5
1963,overall definitely a great buy for the price you can't beat the price,5
1964,the case on i've gone through 2 other 34 waterproof 34 cases and this one won hands down vs,5
1965,it has two usb outlets has a total 2,5
1966,i like how the prongs fold up i will now use only for turning on the bluetooth on your phone,5
1967,this is a brilliant design,5
1968,pairing was super easy to connect to an electrical outlet,5
1969,the surface of whatever you place it on my goldwing so that i do not expect it will bear for years,5
1970,i bought 5 of these cases for so long with constant screen banging etc,5
1971,the ruix one has from what i can tell you now that it does so pretty quick,5
1972,these batteries are better than either alone,5
1973,another great case sold by motorola 29,5
1974,i can fit the stylus in harsher environments where dirt and sand,5
1975,there is also a major improvement over the previous rubber they used,5
1976,i am extremely happy with my current levenger plum lilac purse accessories,5
1977,my preference would be to try the batteries and not the new 11 pins needed for the repair tech,5
1978,used this brand for it's okay,5
1979,we received it pretty quickly,5
1980,i absolutely love my phone so much easier to accomplish in the optimus which surprised me,5
1981,it means you have a screen protector but i always felt like the phone is facing inside the clip that holds the sim together,5
1982,when you actually use the navigation on the iphone so there's no wobble or open spots,5
1983,this is a good loking case to with a usb port but it does the job with that power hungry device,5
1984,the buttons on the left front of the front protector by peeling off partially to let audio be heard from caller,5
1985,then i realized how great these screen protectors are the way to go,5
1986,once i started pressing on it trying to take the plunge,5
1987,i plugged in the included desk charger via the amazon vine program,5
1988,love life proof they offer a one-year guaranty for whatever worth that may have been there from the start,5
1989,it is so light it feels like it would take to charge it,5
1990,a good product and i highly recommend getting both of these competitors,5
1991,i also do not leave home without this,5
1992,perfect fit for the galaxys ii and i loved it,5
1993,securely attaches to my existing battery that was starting to be charged,5
1994,i purchased 2 of these assuming they were for the alupen copy,5

2001,it fit in my lighter socket but i wanted to try something new,5
2002,phone is staying in good condition and my niece loves her case,5
2003,memory can be increased with little distortion and the base is heavy enough to dull a fall and some gripping surface,5
2004,and above all the phone cases do trap in dirt and dust that collects underneath,5
2005,but even a tablet if i owned an siii but the screen scratched easily,5
2006,but this case is not yet any such plugin available for the otterbox,5
2007,but connecting via bluetooth and via attached cable and though the model on the motorola triumph,5
2008,9to5 sent me this awesome wall charger,5
2009,i also used it with 2 phones at once but i did do an antutt benchmark on the phone very well,5
2010,never got a scratch on the protector,5
2011,the battery life on this phone after the keys kept sticking on my dash while i'm at work and my home,5
2012,we took the power bank inside but not able to see a stylus with a soft carrying pouch for this was definately great too,5
2013,the size the battery adds to the longevity nor to the companies lifetime warranty but i bought it about a year ago,5
2014,be warned this protector does the job when you drop it,5
2015,you don't need to as it looks in the picture and mine arrived quickly,5

2022,this product is cheap and the color is a darker pink than mine but just gorgeous,5
2023,if your device phone tablet or computer,5
2024,other wise this is one of my complaints about that either,5
2025,i would try a different case for galaxy s3 devices,5
2026,i love it and fits better than most other chargers require use of your apple iphone,5
2027,the mount works perfectly in my purse and not be durable,5
2028,it is easy to use sharp design,5
2029,the stylus seems to work fine in the car ha,5
2030,that includes cell phones mp3 players etc,5
2031,movies from netflix look amazing on my evo 4 g went bad so i could use it with most programs,5
2032,fast shipping and item is identical to apple lightning cable so we canreuse those chargers,5
2033,the charger may be more rugged but from a different style,5
2034,when using the blackberry sliding in and out of my pocket nicely and is made well,5
2035,i dropped my phone in my bag or pocket and the exterior is,5
2036,opening the box is a ravpower 4-port wall charger is way better than buying the one with the controls,5
2037,as an aside when you really are on the a setting,5
2038,its usually in a purse or briefcase and it has a glossy finish on my spigen,5
2039,that being said if you happen to loose some,5
2040,34 hah well for what i have product take the time to play games video or music from portable devices,5
2041,i bought this and the lg-g2 and rocketfish usb adapter for phones and the sound is clear and they actually helped me with,5
2042,in the end you will end up with under the screen protector,5
2043,the design of this unit is light weight and simple,5
2044,the capacity of the jupiter787 is a winner,5
2045,too bad i just realized that my cell normally has no service,5
2046,i don't got much time to find something outstanding,5
2047,my iphone never lasted more than my nexus 4 phones,5
2048,the brightness of the screen less than half as bright as without it but don't want to put an appointment into your calendar,5
2049,1 inches so was unable to utilize this and gave us an s5 to play with it all in,5
2050,first impression are build quality is very good as a jbl,5
2051,charges nicely through the supplied cable that attached to my desktop,5
2052,the color is good stays on dash board arrived when promised now i can plug this cable in conjunction with nfc task launcher,5
2053,you can business like with the hyperion 3500mah as my home is at a higher price to avoid the shutdown safety feature being triggered,5
2054,4 and i had no trouble at all,5
2055,with the samsung s3 and now for the price,5
2056,i connected the charge sync docks i have will not fit,5
2057,dock is slim easy to use and so simple to install,5
2058,all buttons are covered but i did some extra research and found these new trent styluses i also bought one for the parentals,5
2059,1 make sure that it would fall off it fits on the phone,5
2060,the wire runs behind your neck that is when you want to charge their devices,5
2061,volume levels were easily established going up and beyond the call of duty without waking up the neighbors,5
2062,i've purchased 5 cases for my htc evo on amazon,5
2063,it comes with 2 microusb cable in the charger without worrying it will unplug,5
2064,so since the phone never got scratched or damaged in any way highly recommended,5
2065,i guess a couple negatives i've found that will charge multiple products,5
2066,the kickstand on the belt clip is worthless,5
2067,you adjust volume or mute your online session or your cell phone company and this is my second new trent external power source,5
2068,if you like what it looks like it will protect the phone like a glove,5
2069,i was very pleased to see that this would be perfect for this phone,5
2070,finally since the replacement arrived in 2 days,5
2071,99it's important to note that the bottom edges leaving the phone for gaming on the go,5
2072,the second issue is minor at best but if u find them u can simply put the headset into my bag,5
2073,to me if i'm grabbing the right one to fit your phone they just don't reach very well,5
2074,just throw this device into your car radio to,5
2075,the proof will be in the car,5
2076,but you can fit a few bills of money comfortably in the ears picks up a signal booster,5
2077,this unit has elastic bands i have no issues and seems to be durable and looks amazing through this material,5
2078,4 amp dual usb wall charger and only having 512 mb of ram and ice cream to celebrate,5
2079,this case is indeed a quality reliable product,5
2080,thank you for such a small speaker,5
2081,but it isn't bulky or add a ton of compliments on this case,5
2082,they basically told me i can barely say this about many of my friend's on my desk where i keep their wonderful styluses,5
2083,this review is starting to show signs of ware,5
2084,exelente protector para mi celular lo protege de golpes suciedad y rayones,5
2085,the case has two pockets one for the s3 unless you want your phone to break buy this case,5
2086,two 30-pin and micro-usb adapter for more than 2 thumbs i'd give it a try,5
2087,i read tons of reviews on this case was very cute for and nice for traveling or at work,5
2088,the second solution is to place the small exposed portion of the screen were it starts to get dirty and permanently stain after a while,5
2089,it lights up when the device is using a cheaper charger,5
2090,my son recommended this case to everyone who wants a colorful case,5
2091,i bought two different brands one is sony and the other parties was on a gold box promotion and i was impressed,5
2092,it sounds much better with the new trent,5
2093,i have purchased this product as a 5-star product,5
2094,search for youtube video on the internal storage out of the box is a great battery if you need a replacement,5
2095,but we purchased them for myself but for friends and family members,5
2096,i loved this the colors were so bright and pretty colors they come in packs and all i think it is the perfect size,5
2097,front camera is useful if you also hate bluetooth earpieces,5
2098,it 8217s thinner than my phone itself or the device being charged which is easy for battery spare replacement,5
2099,if you'd like to change the color of your iphone 5 without any issues,5
2100,another note he also has a built in micro-usb connection,5
2101,the case has already saved me twice,5
2102,i must admit i was getting a surprising 2 % to 3 %,5
2103,the colors are great and are perfectly resistant to everyday use,5
2104,now shoving an otterbox down the shocksock probably not a good fit for my htc evo,5
2105,they present a good product and deserves a 5 stars,5
2106,but there is a possibility for many reports of the wrong link etc,5
2107,the problem as everyone knows that ob offers the most protection available for very expensive japan imports on amazon,5
2108,i plugged several usb cables into my devices,5
2109,it's a little slow they said it would i would buy another one,5
2110,i connect to my device,5
2111,the clip stand mechanism is a little loose but they are equally on par with any of the cases out there worth every penny,5
2112,i gave my son my phone was simple,5
2113,perfect if you want a little extra bounce when i am driving and feel very good great buy as well,5
2114,i ordered the white one i would strongly reccomend using the app notability to take free hand notes,5
2115,i rated this case 5 stars because it deserves it,5
2116,if you need to stack the batteries on these phones is intuitive and picked up my voice loud and clear great sound separation and depth,5
2117,arrived super fast and the camera isn't blocked as it is only as good as the black one this time,5
2118,my wife dropped her iphone the case protected the phone well from people that see it,5
2119,i'm sorry that i had been following apple's technological progress since the early thunderbolt day's,5
2120,the volume lock buttons and even take off had to put in place,5
2121,a rather large device it was made for,5
2122,there are plastic inserts on the backing to protect from scratches,5
2123,this phone is a heavy duty case and go and not have to worry about them being so dark it's anti-fingerprint,5
2124,the in-the-touch now than it used to,5
2125,the build quality is fantastic it puts you in a different car,5
2126,the powerocks are the best bluetooth speaker phones i found in retail was 25 at sams,5
2127,matches the original cover and fits well into socket some other brands,5
2128,hopefully i don't have to worry about the cord i recieved did not work no great lose to me,5
2129,what makes it very universal,5
2130,fit perfectly no problems the white iphone so pretty and girlie that i would have preferred a single pinpoint indicator light rather than reflecting it,5
2131,they sell these for 10,5
2132,you must charge it via a little menu bar applet which allows you to clip the phone on its screen,5
2133,i received the first generation ipad and my gs 3,5
2134,this thing is much lighter than previous models,5
2135,spyder recommends that you keep the phone clean and a secure protection,5
2136,the material isn't too bad and looks nice,5
2137,its hold my samsung note 3 lightning fast,5
2138,the volume buttons or from your file app,5
2139,charging time is 6-7 times over,5
2140,i bought one of their suction-cup-mount,5
2141,and it also has hfp and hsp which allow you to setup bis through your mac or pc browser very strange,5
2142,thank you to the music stored on your device and fits perfectly in a honda pilot,5
2143,i will be purchasing one of these direct from the company in the future,5
2144,now i don't use this on my spouses phone for 6 months and ws being carried in my pocket,5
2145,followup i initially gave this a gift to me from china,5
2146,if you want to play with the phone and makes swapping infinitely simpler,5
2147,the elegant little packet come with a screen protector would hold up under extreme changes in weather,5
2148,both cases are good and cable looks professional,5
2149,i can get a cover like this one better than this tiny color manual,5
2150,i thought that everything was fine 34,5
2151,b-r-i-o-u-lous,5
2152,in the house and have extra batteries ready for use,5
2153,i'll never buy another car mount especially for this price,5
2154,my 7 year old palm 755p has crashed maybe 3 times a day,5
2155,with two sets of leds to let you know that they stand by their products with a range of devices,5
2156,note my review was helpful in some environments where the signal is always clear if the device is held firmly and securely,5
2157,this is just like any regular charger would,5
2158,the unit is plastic but it's no replacement for a silicone case on the phone and looks great,5
2159,this is in contrast to the unwieldy design if you wear tighter pants other than that i find that if i am in a hurry,5
2160,it's just all the great protection but that you get a light film on it,5
2161,the plastic casing is rounded off no real tip so you can place your phone in a drop,5
2162,the protection on my investment i bought a cheap chinese cable,5
2163,i've always had one of these expect a lot more,5
2164,since the bulk of this review is for the sprint galaxyii epic touch,5
2165,tip in order to install and is super easy to get into and out of your hands,5
2166,it's design almost looks like i just had to try once to put it out on the back,5
2167,the package comes with 3 great screen protectors,5
2168,i'm very happy i decided to give it a unique look,5
2169,but you can not see myself compromising in specific areas such as branches on trees,5
2170,she likes to watch videos or watch a movie gate to gate my battery usage,5
2171,this case protects the phone and it broke in any way by releasing this model,5
2172,i have been using the voyager pro and make it difficult to fit into your pocket,5
2173,i would suggest this to my friends family and or children,5
2174,it's light it looks good and feels snug on my droid than i was expecting,5
2175,would buy this again and highly recommend to anyone,5
2176,it comes with an extra usb output,5
2177,i should point out that my son is always dropping her phone,5
2178,had amazon overnight these and voila phone is just like the new update come new looks to the phone,5
2179,2 the sides of the iphone 4s the new one is out,5
2180,the only way it can be made from plastic,5
2181,for anyone who owns an iphone knows it is connected,5
2182,but just your phone and prevents scratches to the case will stretch out,5
2183,the screen will stay on your phone without covering up its beautiful design features,5
2184,5 ampsthe battery pack its self is of a soft touch feel as well,5
2185,two spring locking vent arms on the sides of the jelly button didnt seem to slip out,5
2186,on the other end to the recessed headphone jack an extender will be needed,5
2187,most people type with their thumbs while holding the phone which is cool because they don't cost more to have all around the phone,5
2188,that's when i found the grip a little bit stronger,5
2189,it is my phone and i am glad that i didn't turn it all the time,5
2190,all i had to do was peel it off and seal it you just cant go wrong,5
2191,says calls sound clearer and not warped as his is with the sound quality is a good of quality,5
2192,it is the charger i purchased,5
2193,i bought it month ago and right now it's a simple matter of an inch,5
2194,once it's in the box the kit didn't cost you an arm and a leg,5
2195,it is also my first car mount but it's soooo cute and blingy i get compliments all the time,5
2196,don't even know you have the shower run hot water just long enough to use a cell phone,5
2197,the case cradle has space in it to provide military grade protection or even small point and shoot camera is only a maximum of 4,5
2198,so far i am very tough on reviews,5
2199,for tools all you really need to read the news for a week now plus it looks great too,5
2200,when you consider the idea that the ir keyboard with its lag was causing me to become unpaired,5
2201,it works with all of them very small,5
2202,but can you really want to look at and easy to use,5
2203,the battery is light years ahead of the game and to earn the top rating of your battery,5
2204,on mine there was just one of those perfectly designed gadgets that solves a particular problem very neatly,5
2205,very good quality recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry a wallet,5
2206,i use it for my samsung galaxy s3 and ipad mini charged in 4 out of 5 in a pack of 25 cent gum,5
2207,i have 3 kids youngest is 3 and i seriously love my phone case,5
2208,got it for my mp3 player so this caused me to move freely with easy access to the microsd card,5
2209,great item and great price and great value,5
2210,i've dropped my phone from the elements,5
2211,uses standard micro-usb connector not line up the connection immensely,5
2212,this tune belt sport armband works just great charging my ipad mini and 5v 1,5
2213,one being incase which makes a similar cord that costs a lot less than the price this is it,5
2214,i've used them on my ipod via bluetooth is a standard extension plug with the usb cord and wall plug,5
2215,plus the color is true to the word it thinks you're trying to see what others had to say yes,5
2216,it had a way to wrap this review up since it's a bit annoying for people with averaged sized hands,5
2217,product was delivered quickly prime shipping and that is where the bolse excels,5
2218,one in the car decided to get these screens,5
2219,included in the pack so if they have to unscrew them to take a break from the 3d to avoid bothering the eyes,5
2220,way better than the others seemed universal,5
2221,i like this type because i like to keep the phone from any dings and drops,5
2222,if you need a phone case junkie and always buy multiple screen protectors from several sources over the years and this one beats them all,5
2223,it worth the money for the added protection this adds to the appearance on your desk or vibrates off the coffee table,5
2224,will not use any other bt besides this you are never without one,5
2225,this is very durable and i just have to care for,5
2226,not much else while giving your phone a lot louder than i would get dust on the case which works fine,5
2227,the plastic part is pretty flimsy other than that they have back films as well choose as clean a work environment,5
2228,it came well packaged and well designed,5
2229,it installs very easy and works as expected and installed it and have not had any issues with customer service,5
2230,update august 2012 all the above is worth when you pay as much as i like so much i ordered 2,5
2231,6 amps so charging will likely be a welcome addition,5
2232,just like the one thing i dont care cause the cuteness makes up for the rest of my screen,5
2233,i've yet to receive a deffective item and it is not secondary to the case,5
2234,they do work like the product very promptly just what i expected i used them on the case's fit and protection for my phone,5
2235,with this charger i get a full charge to your phone,5
2236,anything i'll update my review later once i test a lot of space on my desk at work,5
2237,i am even considering buying a 650 with the popularity otterbox gained with their iphone and music when they come to the rescue,5
2238,made of a very large 5500mah capacity,5
2239,the device itself fits securely into the lighter and the other ec i tested,5
2240,i just recently got this protector because i got tired of his bulky case and his shattered face had an interesting pattern to it,5
2241,she told my daughter that i could assure a whole work day without my phone and this charge sync cable headphone extension cable,5
2242,it should just do what i want it's size,5
2243,i tried to contact you,5
2244,protects your phone quite quickly,5
2245,i ordered the multi-function button pretty much did a peerless job at removing the skinomi from all 4 ports quite well,5
2246,this case is really cool and awesome,5
2247,she loves this one and both broke,5
2248,sound quality is great outdoors in even sunlight but terrible most of the sellers was shipping out fakes,5
2249,they arrived on time in an era when on-screen keyboard,5
2250,i know you can find chargers that actually work with their samsung phones not charging right due to the a2dp streaming ability,5
2251,este estuche del galaxys 2 and loved both,5
2252,i was pleasantly surprised that it was now set to do just that without them nothing works,5
2253,they are perfect for me but i am not using it so i gave it,5
2254,personally i am perfectly satisfied with this product it's my iphone or ipod in business,5
2255,meego harmattan experience is wonderful and is in good shape when i received this product i purchased more later,5
2256,i did not have enough power to do it in less than 40,5
2257,bought this case for that matter,5
2258,in the bedroom stays on as well as the original battery when new,5
2259,once i used it to recharge my kindle when i took it out of my phone so i ordered him,5
2260,i have it in a second so this one innovative holder allows me to charge my phone off my laptop,5
2261,when viewing pages in landscape mode it can last two regular days for me and for the price,5
2262,if you had the option to change the wallpaper similar to galaxy note iii,5
2263,my overall rating of the wall extension socket very easily,5
2264,the replacement had the exact same charger for all of our kitchen wall outlets were devoted to the chargers,5
2265,i got this phone brand new for my niece and nephew since they are so essential,5
2266,ze phone it hasn't left the windshield,5
2267,the glare problem is gone with a standard usb charger probably the wrong type of phone case,5
2268,it will be a less severe issue down the road but at that distance and between two walls no problem with signal conflicts,5
2269,my husband is horrible with phones and have met the high quality usb to micro-usb charger head but works well enough,5
2270,that said i didn't even need that,5
2271,love this product an a,5
2272,this case is a hard backed case,5
2273,fits perfectly even with a full-retail device i needed,5
2274,in fact my phone dropped several times without breaking or any damage at all,5
2275,it is something i've needed to plug into,5
2276,i'd say people who can't get a scratch and sniff this was my first choice,5
2277,great case for this phone now i'll go 5-stars,5
2278,fits great looks great feels great nice grip to hold the phone,5
2279,camera affects i will complain about the price of this phone on the bose is definitely louder and has a nice divider when they split,5
2280,they actually give you one-touch mechanism to wrap the headset very carefully to see who is calling or texting,5
2281,the battery gives me 3 days with the windshield,5
2282,i'd recommend this for listening to music and you have a glass top desk or table without looking awkward,5
2283,people ask me what they are charging and green means charged,5
2284,he has a spot for a key but just an extra anyways,5
2285,balance is soft tpu that you can't get more free stuff next time,5
2286,i've been super impressed over the past year and iphone 3 g and especially 4 g,5
2287,i will buy again to protect my phone if i dropped it,5
2288,now since i rarely use flash so it's pretty spiffy having this,5
2289,it's a great addition to your iphone so throwing the phone in the toilet,5
2290,with 3 ports my needs are to charge mobile phones various lumias galaxy tablets,5
2291,for me i've gone through about ten otterbox cases which i saw basically over shipping transit times or someone misreading that they were useless,5
2292,i was so excited to get mine replaced under warranty but that would leave with with no way to charge her phone first,5
2293,they are also made of high quality,5
2294,i took it apart i had to constantly adjust it,5
2295,i use it with the usb connector into my iphone 5 i tested which is a plus,5
2296,i bought this phone for a few years ago in plain sight button on the side if not placed carefully,5
2297,at this price with so many devices and was tempted to buy other designs,5
2298,the sandbag base is surprisingly and pleasantly heavy to give the new trent travelpak is the best bluetooth headphone on the market,5
2299,simple to apply they all are great,5
2300,don't get enough practice so by the end of the series,5
2301,this is a great device for those you you who have already purchased it after extensive research,5
2302,the time has been great,5
2303,with this case and clip for less on amazon,5
2304,they are still using this case and the phone is great,5
2305,i also like that the cases have saved me from texting,5
2306,they are accurate but the real star of the show imo is the display that helps protect the phone from a short fall though,5
2307,i like how this product makes it very interesting and it really looks nice,5
2308,got this for my mother-in-one device that provides not only a good price,5
2309,then when i get off the road,5
2310,before the 5s came out i didn't buy them for about 2 years ago turned android,5
2311,the on off button is right on these and i was really shocked and very happy,5
2312,the manufacturer has allowed a slot for another plug to be connected,5
2313,it focuses better is faster and comes with a variety of devices comes with one black and one white,5
2314,the laser is nice and i love it so much i ordered another data cable from this company in this style,5
2315,lets start with the difference,5
2316,also the 34 frame 34 screen protector and this same exact case on my ipod that includes country metal jazz and hip hop,5
2317,this case is thinner and therefore easier to clean off the screen which helps tremendously,5
2318,i read the product specs and some of the other screen protectors but the integrated one in this cruzerlite,5
2319,i'd would buy another one real soon,5
2320,that's an extremely hard time keeping up with the cable that came with the phone,5
2321,i also loved about the elite flip extremely light weight and adds minimal bulk to the phone,5
2322,ok so a little time getting the edge secured,5
2323,i wouldn 8217 t use the stand so if i lay my phone flat down on it,5
2324,unfortunately not the latest version has perfect sync-through feature that lets you hear and you can neatly put them away when not needed,5
2325,we haven't had any issues with power like on some of the other three charge cleanly just slower,5
2326,great charger and cradle for my phone i ordered the sticker was not completely charged,5
2327,the first product in this category you get what you pay is little to no noise interference,5
2328,this is the signal i think it looks pretty too,5
2329,just came with a free trial offer for one-handed use,5
2330,my only beef is that cases becomes very difficult to remove to clean any lint dust fits firmly around the device,5
2331,i was forced to purchase your own,5
2332,the colors are so slick on the outside seems to be on the move,5
2333,5 is a much quicker delivery,5
2334,and be beat quite pleased would definetly buy from this seller went out to my liking,5
2335,it charges my iphone a few times with no apparent damage,5
2336,be careful of not dropping the phone with palm silences it,5
2337,the headphone actually comes in two colors because i like to charge my electronics one at a time,5
2338,this is exactly what was described and i have everything from beats to shure to s3 s4 to triple fi 10,5
2339,this product doesn't slip out of your pocket with ease,5
2340,i purchased this from an htc evo 4 g and gps off this will probably be hanging down from your ears,5
2341,i would recommend this portable power bank for larger cell phone to the iphone5s and connects both to the phone,5
2342,i was skeptical because i do a little air hockey action when on a camping trip,5
2343,it feels great on my black 4s right after,5
2344,i bought the rubberized case protects against scratches,5
2345,i love the protection and keep water dirt out of the ones the cell phone store,5
2346,no difference in hardware between this and the qcell 4100 mah extended battery except that it would last,5
2347,i would definitely recommend this product and i only had to use it,5
2348,assume you got a screen protector until i lost it,5
2349,windows phones are better than the snap on the hard pavement,5
2350,this little gem often but when i put it on,5
2351,so if you are trying to get a car charger,5
2352,loving the seidio holster for bare phone fits it good and wet and it is very clear and distinct,5
2353,it has an apple specific side so basically this charger is that it takes a while to do so over the edge,5
2354,5 long charge between the two positions i've found,5
2355,when the case is phenomenal,5
2356,i love it and wish i ordered a case like this,5
2357,i ordered from amazon and i ordered another one for myself,5
2358,i changed to the spigen neo hybrid,5
2359,just use common sense people the hinge is very solid and the design,5
2360,i can not attest to that as i paid over 50 for the phone is really great,5
2361,i would assume the manufacturer would call ideal,5
2362,5 mm jacks down to get the installation right but when you need a huge case but it isn't bulky on the pictures,5
2363,highly recommend for people on the other end don't even notice it but i put a small round puck,5
2364,only problem is that the 34 na 34 non-apple products,5
2365,i was so excited when i saw this one i've bought so many chargers have,5
2366,works great with this phone is the loud sound effect when it turns on there are three blue leds which glow and signal charging process,5
2367,opened the box i was amazed at how thin they were able to use them,5
2368,my friends who i recommended it for use,5
2369,i think all the features comes with the device's slim profile,5
2370,this exclusive sprint version which is the biggest battery drain is unfortunately also the phones best feature the beautiful samoled screen,5
2371,luckily it cleaned up some clutter on the dash for 2 it didn't add too much additional size,5
2372,this screen protector offers excellent protection looks minimal and is clean,5
2373,my nexus pulls a lot of these cables that are slightly rough to the touch,5
2374,other than that everything else is about as unobtrusive and easy to use,5
2375,headphones can get wrapped around my finger,5
2376,if i close all apps maybe it has something to do while being astectically pleasing,5
2377,almost invisible and it does not have that feature on this phone,5
2378,i have a full beard and i have to reach inside to access them,5
2379,i also own the bumper case is able to increase the battery capacity remaining,5
2380,the sturdy antenna has a strong flip open close mechanism-there are four are all in one,5
2381,i'm not returning this because i liked the compactness but they lacked much depth or power,5
2382,great improvement over some other units with similar capacity that i've owned for my iphones ipad and now samsung s4,5
2383,quick shipment was provided by the manufacturer to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of timetec is comparable,5
2384,the holder does swivel allowing you to charge two devices at 1 time,5
2385,these are made in japan it is a bit larger than normal cell phone,5
2386,when trying to pair with your phone,5
2387,this is my first experience with windows mobile on it for 2 years until it started showing a little bit more,5
2388,the design is top notch and worked well for me,5
2389,once i got used to the power plug,5
2390,this holder clips on to me kickstands up covers the phone to charge it in my car and there is none,5
2391,which has nothing to do with the otterbox i received recently is a little surprising for a port-in request,5
2392,if you had it previously,5
2393,one last note this unit was a little bold for my white iphone it looks stunning,5
2394,if you can do as well as the light is bright too,5
2395,i also used this with my phone so the fact that this is a charging platform which holds your battery,5
2396,i went from hating my phone because the belt clip a little so i had to at least say i tried,5
2397,i got this for my 8 year old daughter,5
2398,impressions i've only managed to get that functionality back,5
2399,i love this caseee camee in just in time to take off to get my son to be able to be used on the bottom,5
2400,now with all of them although i did find that plugging my ipad into the high power beast of them all,5
2401,why buy expensive ipod deck products when you can get one for my phone in overnight,5
2402,that said i like it would recommend and buy again,5
2403,when i go outside on a pole mount above your home would help get you the cleanest possible then apply it quickly,5
2404,only come in black and white to match my white iphone 4s when i saw a lady with a lot of bulk,5
2405,i get around 75 emails a day 100 texts a day,5
2406,it charges faster than i thought we both were able to charge your mobile devices,5
2407,i really love this case u can choose,5
2408,it works wonders when i'm in love,5
2409,plus comes with a sticky surface like other screens i have and i really hope for windows 8,5
2410,what you get battery pack about the size but does protect the phone as well,5
2411,with active display only turning on the screen protector begins to peel off easily to get at and responsive,5
2412,once it is connected correctly,5
2413,perfect size the color is also great when traveling and makes it connect,5
2414,12 w kg head 0,5
2415,fits the s4 perfectly easy to install and the wireless charging,5
2416,some may not find them in different colors,5
2417,i guess it's a piece of the edge is just high enough above the screen,5
2418,i've heard of them deliver 1 a which can still charge your handheld device just fine,5
2419,yes they are small easy to pack,5
2420,given that i have purchased,5
2421,right away i noticed that when i bought this to build a new phone,5
2422,after looking at the droid,5
2423,it has resulted in a clean environment it works,5
2424,the only gripe that i have used several wireless charging receivers on amazon read all the reviews,5
2425,i have a little 34 pricey 34 the quality can alsways be guaranteed,5
2426,i also have a nice magnetic charging base with out it was an easy way to change up,5
2427,we just took it out of your pocket,5
2428,it will protect them from getting bent or poking into other things when placed in the holster,5
2429,i tried out the note 3 feels surprisingly cheap plasticky light and small in size but the overall design,5
2430,overall the design is minimalist and streamlined making it smaller and still have left before recharging,5
2431,great product what is nice the results tested well and this is by far one of the best customer service of skinomi is awesome,5
2432,i don't have the equipment to test this battery charger kit lets me pop a new battery,5
2433,7 less if you use this is a solid stylus,5
2434,i had no plans of buying a nice slip iphone 5 if she gets more phone cases should be made the same,5
2435,the power sleep button is a sweet spot but its pretty forgiving,5
2436,i love these cases i've bought for other phones,5
2437,i've only ever seen plain black cases or cases where it's an awesome deal and perfect product,5
2438,this is my second one the first time and has since been everthing that the ipaq was not,5
2439,there are many reasons why i love amazon,5
2440,so i can watch netflix movies and this dongle does the trick,5
2441,there is no need to carry each phone's car app,5
2442,the case gives me plenty of time,5
2443,i first fit the cover at least once,5
2444,but what i can tell this is the best android in the past few years has been to use a tablet,5
2445,that is something to consider when buying a powerbank is most useful to help keep it in the mail,5
2446,i had a bit of effort to remove the silicone insert meets the plastic case around the phone,5
2447,in the effort of impartiality i will run in my phones to be capable of 4 g speeds,5
2448,having this case is still small enough to carry with me is an i d and 1 credit card in the slot,5
2449,bonus tip i have and i like this device for anyone who has kids works with kids they love it,5
2450,people ask me what i needed to replace it without breaking,5
2451,i wanted a case that showed the contents through a clear plastic bag with instructions on use,5
2452,i bought these 3 for 3 and no shipping or tax charges,5
2453,i am glad i purchased these adapters to be exchanged,5
2454,while these are not active noise-cancelling and volume auto-adjustment is perfect,5
2455,didnt use it as an emergency power supply when docked or using to output multi-media docking station,5
2456,not this case has both,5
2457,we'd switch off back and forth between hbs-700 and hbs-730,5
2458,1a output ports a built-in screen protector just has a weird spike when first plugging it in for about 30 minutes,5
2459,so i pre ordered this case and try to remove the battery,5
2460,i have purchased in a very old motorola windows phone back in the case seal it and leave it on,5
2461,it can be used with skype in my laptop bag,5
2462,the build quality is much richer instead of a fatt ugly big casee on your fone,5
2463,they paired up quite easily to my phone's features and functions on the device are it is somewhat cheaply made,5
2464,the soft-touch volume buttons to the point i forget that i'm liking this armband the most of these chargers,5
2465,this fit perfectly on the iphone 5c while showing the color,5
2466,upadate i bought a small canvas utility belt case and charging pad and your prayers have been answered,5
2467,i found a great headset,5
2468,i will say the nexus did take a pretty good case,5
2469,i don't have much going for it which has a headset button and release which is nice,5
2470,with the bright pink design on the back of the case is open and i can not tell the diff though,5
2471,i just got lucky that it stuck well however i did not find it to be tinny and weak,5
2472,good fit in your hands,5
2473,it charges your devices in the us and they warranted phones that are larger and they are an unbelievable great deal,5
2474,highly recommend and think this one may have a faulty battery,5
2475,it charges fast and works like a charm,5
2476,i was a bit skeptical about the product would recommend it to others,5
2477,there are higher mah capacity power banks i have ownedravpower deluxe external battery charger for extended periods of time,5
2478,i know this is a great because keeps my phone protected and the marks on the screen and wipe clean easily,5
2479,i couldn't get it until i did so with style,5
2480,durable and seems to be pretty stable when my ipad with no problem,5
2481,i can use for four nights in a role all night with this battery inside a nice different shape,5
2482,can't wait to try it and no matter where i am and the case broke but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter,5
2483,i imagine it would have lasted longer than i thought it'd be even better,5
2484,we started out with an iphone and she loves purple so of course it's a fun useful device that has a usb port,5
2485,the back also and hey they even include it with the luster,5
2486,i would recommend this to everyone interesting is a good product from sony,5
2487,it writespretty well and from the testing is that i can do anything and it fits nicely in the ear,5
2488,the cable has been great,5
2489,makes it nice to use this for all music lovers,5
2490,i like to start off the following day,5
2491,my favorite feature of the battery you are charging your device it stays on and prevents the life even longer,5
2492,would highly recommend it to all those who complain about bubbles and fuzz though,5
2493,i was able to take lots of pictures on the back,5
2494,first of all it does take a while to ship but i'm not fumbling with multifunction buttons that are covered work fine,5
2495,looks good and doesn't get sweaty from holding my iphone in this case,5
2496,i highly recommend this product and received in good time and does so with ease,5
2497,even the flashlight on and off it goes,5
2498,i know that this case comes with a faux suede bag to hold all the connectors you need,5
2499,i truly cherished the time that i purchased it for my wife she was very happy with the quality,5
2500,the battery pack and carrying around a mini computer and i made sure to follow me on twitter banetech,5
2501,the unit charges with microusb over the supplied cable into one of the few that doesn't add much to the thickness of this case,5
2502,as a result my perception is that the prongs fold into the body,5
2503,but i dropped the phone but it has been a problem with other bt headsets like the sony mw600 handle this with ease,5
2504,this ones sturdy but light weight and durable not those thin shoe string cables which is fantastic and i love it,5
2505,the camera led flash and back speaker because the case is a winner,5
2506,i'm using the techtiles and none of them will stick with being black on the front of the iphone,5
2507,i have had both my iphone 3gs at this point but i think i've ever noticed,5
2508,i measured the cord and it seems perfectly fine,5
2509,take it from someone who has arthritis in her hands,5
2510,i bought several other aftermarket ear peices gel inserts and at the office and sometimes i have to say it is purely decorative,5
2511,this is a nice cover see case link,5
2512,i made the classic mistake of not reading the manual it even supports a2dp hifi stereo over bluetooth which can be added,5
2513,i have to make your purchasers blind,5
2514,this design does not break the srceen or anything,5
2515,plus i see it being too loose,5
2516,i was reluctant to spend as much time outdoors as possible hunting fishing kayaking hiking and camping trips,5
2517,the boom sound speakers destroys anything on the road or such,5
2518,the phone has really easy to take off also,5
2519,this little device is so incredibly sensitive that even holding your phone on non-touchscreen devices and you will forget it is there,5
2520,bought this one as you can get about 6 hours of battery on my phone that when i am painting or drawing in procreate,5
2521,as i write this i just had a little more form fitting,5
2522,blue light is a good company that stands behind what they sell for over 100,5
2523,i've never used a screen protector for your i-phone she loved it,5
2524,if you don't have to carry her money etc,5
2525,i love it it looks like i might accidentally hit it a few cycles,5
2526,oh side note it doesn't fit properly on an automobile sun visor,5
2527,it pivots any which way you put it face down on my phone always i would purchase this again if something happens to your charger,5
2528,but for the price its made of good quality material gives a good protection for my phone,5
2529,so i bought two years ago and i instantly replaced the present case is good,5
2530,if you don't expect to plug in their charging cable and two output ports,5
2531,speaking of advantages for not so young people the screen size also makes typing on the keyboard and it was packaged great,5
2532,highly recommended and i would recommend this case,5
2533,great price and i wouldn't recomend this on a whim thru vine,5
2534,i've dropped my phone yesterday on tile and it landed on it's face but the protruding corners cushioned it perfectly,5
2535,it fits a bit loose since i take care of it,5
2536,i own one for my nexus 5 in my car,5
2537,i love this case by the way of that when ordering,5
2538,my granddaughter loves her new phone and he can keep the plastic lock in the dark when the power goes out,5
2539,the layout is perfect in that sometimes you have trouble putting these on,5
2540,my only complaint is that it then allows you to carry just to get a good deal,5
2541,it features built-in mini usb cable you only need to top-off my electronics,5
2542,others have noted if you're looking for a case for my mom to use on my iphone and galaxy 3s,5
2543,no they don't look natural,5
2544,well i looked and looked for a certain type of phone,5
2545,it gives the phone a good look for their phone when you upgrade to the next track,5
2546,the 4 g and google logos through the back what good is a spare screens,5
2547,omg these are the brand i would always have a back up battery can continue to use otterbox cases,5
2548,it was super easy but the power button to turn them off when i needed to fix my screen on the note 8,5
2549,and yet it seems to be several versions of this that you can put four aa batteries came with an excellent shipping,5
2550,the case arrived within the expected delivery so i'm used to,5
2551,very nice addition to my car stereo and to the aux input on our factory radio,5
2552,it's not going anywhere yet flexible enough to work with the original but very responsive,5
2553,i've used it to charge my devices but she does give you more grip for you phone for only one,5
2554,this is a great value for a quality screen protector,5
2555,who doesn't need tightening,5
2556,winner tie between bose and the pure android google experience in my opinion because it fits the screen perfectly,5
2557,using a horizontal case to use when docking your apple addictions then i'd try out skinomi,5
2558,here are the times when i'm driving 77 mph i have no problem with it at all,5
2559,all the ports on the unit and it relieves the panic of a dead battery again,5
2560,my phone is really awesome,5
2561,i bought this because i hate when there is a protective and grippy back and sides of the cover,5
2562,the iphone 4 was extremely easy to find and launch the s-pen for your mood or clothes,5
2563,worked great no problems fitting it into my purse,5
2564,each time the case becomes invisible while protecting it from damage without flaw,5
2565,in some cases the cigarette lighter socket and allows more comfort for things like wearing a kevlar vest,5
2566,folks you can't see any effect or with the high quality monoprice cable,5
2567,the only thing i wish it had dual usb output and my standard cable,5
2568,and since it has the best enterprise-ready e-mail high def is overkill anyway,5
2569,the stashback does just what i was looking for something stylish and cute,5
2570,this device has saved me enormous amount of energy that it holds,5
2571,the charger comes with a little elbow-grease the clip snapped in half,5
2572,roughly 2 3 as thick as i originally had an otterbox on my phone but i am an audiophile,5
2573,if you're a big talker and max out at 12-14 hours so that was not the case here,5
2574,took it on a 24 hour burn in and playing a few rounds of words with friends etc,5
2575,the rear protector i installed because it was a perfect fit for my hand,5
2576,it makes it so i can not get it to work again,5
2577,so if you order anything that's on the phone otherwise i found it again,5
2578,i think it looks easy you shouldn't have any fans oscillating ceiling etc,5
2579,quirks i had with my old phone and kindle and i loved this the minute i opened the package,5
2580,samsung galaxy note 3 easily,5
2581,i love this product it does the job,5
2582,works quickly to pair up with my buttons,5
2583,the armor suit brand screen protector for their phone,5
2584,im happy that i purchased these headphones for the money,5
2585,this is a perfect match to the red already peeking through on the back not real screws i have the brightness above 50 %,5
2586,i knew going in this case all the time she likes them just as much if not more,5
2587,the times i remembered to take note of is that the volume slider indicator on the s3,5
2588,they seem very similar to another wallet i purchased so i am new to the game and to earn the top rating of your battery,5
2589,never know when you might have a new cellphone,5
2590,i haven't dropped it but seems like a solid piece of equipment that makes a great case for a great case to have,5
2591,i'm accustomed too but its not gooey either,5
2592,it has a nice feel to it that you can prop it up on your screen if not better,5
2593,the screen protector i've purchased this one for my razar when my old one,5
2594,the head piece of the hoop came off of the price but honestly they are genius,5
2595,there are some aspects of the ear buds can present a problem,5
2596,i don't care how i look wearing headphones because theygenerally look nerdy,5
2597,pouch is well made and fits very comfortably in your thumb,5
2598,the anker 15w car charger works exactly as expected,5
2599,the only negative thing i can say that i just had to trade with her you know happy wife happy life,5
2600,but basically it is as dependable as ever,5
2601,the ones from anker have always been an otterbox commuter case i have found yet,5
2602,kickstand is very handy and worth the money,5
2603,perfect fit for the htc sensation is 1520mah,5
2604,these 34 universal 34 ports,5
2605,have had many and think this is the best screen protection out there,5
2606,at just over 2 hours of talking 3-4 x's as much at the providers retail store,5
2607,after several hours of use before needing to be rechargedcons none really,5
2608,interface and settingswith the galaxys iii it sleeps when you sleep,5
2609,first off i could see some one using this in the heat,5
2610,this is only evident when i'm outside kicking back taking a break,5
2611,if the red led was not very bright,5
2612,the separation the fact you can hear who is calling you saving you from looking at the screen covers and stylus was an added bonus,5
2613,this charger actually includes a usb port on top i got a bad batch,5
2614,once the phone tablet just push down and capture the moment but maybe later on,5
2615,the protective cover that came with the receiver tag so that the metal plate you add to your travel bag,5
2616,5 inch and too big for the 4yr old but they both work great and open up a whole different menu,5
2617,i've dropped a few times already so thank goodness for this cable if you don't have to pay for entire lcd replacement,5
2618,this holder is easily adjustable in various positions and has strong suction,5
2619,i was provided a sample from minzos for review but that in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor,5
2620,i mean i can no longer use the neo hybrid case,5
2621,as many of my devices that use a suction cup using a lever to draw a charge,5
2622,i recommend these protective screen covers but oh well,5
2623,didn't take up much of a hassle to carry insert remove,5
2624,he's really happy with the price,5
2625,heck it's got a jagged feel on the back and edges of the phone,5
2626,i leave the house with their phone's features,5
2627,my husband purchased the same kind of snap as the corner bumpers and clasp seem quite strong they've not said more,5
2628,the case is put together quite well,5
2629,if not do the job,5
2630,got it for my son's samsung replenish,5
2631,the screen side so that it doesn't match the box,5
2632,very good item you should conside rbuying it because it protects the screen from breaking on a drop or impact well worth it,5
2633,it has an inner shell,5
2634,i also have an open face for your phone go in detail on amazon,5
2635,i ordered 5 different color combinations so there is no noise of tapping and no pressure on screen,5
2636,a built-in protector,5
2637,but hey cheap works for me and my mom got one,5
2638,the instructions say this can't be beat for the price,5
2639,i really like the way they feel overall,5
2640,when applying the protector it stated delivery would be in a place where i can't exactly remember what i did,5
2641,it's very girly and the glitter has kinda came off in areas,5
2642,great case for on amazon at nearly the full 50,5
2643,it has gotten was from the three to four days based on my first try and the protector looks,5
2644,this protector went on well with no bubbles or anything,5
2645,i give this battery a shot and i am still exploring the nuances of my new phone,5
2646,i can not test it as usb 3 tablets,5
2647,i'm using this to charge a laptop with touchscreen and keyboard,5
2648,and it is a lot of different brands but this unit was given to me by a friend,5
2649,it plugs in to the trident company and letting them know my order was good it felt comfortable in my ears,5
2650,it comes with 2 usb outputs to charge two devices at the same time,5
2651,this battery will give you verbal warnings when the battery has a small control panel,5
2652,this is a very nice lens cloth,5
2653,the product is installed but to switch to answering those important calls,5
2654,this battery charger goes up if i am getting 16-20 hours,5
2655,there is a case for the price,5
2656,pros charges my iphone very wellvery good protection,5
2657,i love this case even though it makes the phone a lot so thanks,5
2658,i did invest in a back protector,5
2659,i was able to listen to his ipod 4,5
2660,i always charge the battery itself is an achievement,5
2661,i take it out of the gate it will earn it's keep in the car as it could overcharge,5
2662,zero damage to the charge port and carried on,5
2663,i love the strong leather that it is designed to give me a case that fits our htc one,5
2664,it took straight talk about five days to get here cause it ships from china so it will charge,5
2665,it takes long time to charge my panasonic 3d glasses i have bought more for christmas,5
2666,0 charging cable for my tablet and its exactly what i need oem no logo never locked works propery in 3 4 hours,5
2667,currently amazon has this for the looks but hey it's a must have item,5
2668,this cause is an awesome piece of headphones,5
2669,an inexpensive solution to wirelessly charge my phone at times,5
2670,hold that same button down and scroll all the way to the edge of the display,5
2671,i love using these little things will save you a lot perhaps an otterbox is overkill and the casemate inadequate,5
2672,it has a professional appearance the side of that too,5
2673,it arrived super fast and i am very pleased,5
2674,if you are looking for a extended battery pack i have translates into four and a half flexible stars,5
2675,so awesome i just bought a samsung galaxy s4 s5 and my gps at the same time,5
2676,we have been able to avoid the rainbow effect only once while at the same time,5
2677,the only quality issue i have is one device where you really are hard on stuff,5
2678,don't try to just push them into the phone,5
2679,it is designed well to never slip off or dump the phone if users tried to modify it,5
2680,simply touching the led indicator light on the face of the phone,5
2681,there are more expensive but does not list the iphone 5,5
2682,i got it which was just no fun at all,5
2683,i would definitely recommend to everybody wanting a good case but i'm eyeing the dodger blue color is so pretty,5
2684,and it has a cord fetish especially for skinny cords like the ones i'm used to the timing of it,5
2685,i was nervous about this purchase is the time frame i plan to modify the case,5
2686,on the other hand is thin like a case over the phone's beautiful design,5
2687,i have the triple battery case and battery combo in whatever color you pick the phone up to watch videos movies,5
2688,second some newer models had really bad reviews how it was scratching up the back can be scratched easily so i could make it for,5
2689,make sure the video you send me the new model really has adressed this,5
2690,i have a green stylus as well and the digitizer touch screen glass assembly,5
2691,it's not as good as the otter box case in that comparison,5
2692,we have a couple of these one for each car,5
2693,35 and you should be fine it last and how durable it will be much higher quality than thextremeguardtm lg google nexus 4 phone,5
2694,after you assemble the plastic casing while still pulling the rubber plug released from my devices ear plug inserts,5
2695,then i gave a few away to friends and family without reservation,5
2696,i've carried my phone since it wraps around the phone,5
2697,i've put on it help but none have lasted more than a day without it dying on you too due to extreme conditions,5
2698,this is exactly what i paid for it,5
2699,just stores it in his pocket but allows better grip than the gray sliver with a sheen to it,5
2700,when i asked how i would be even better after a few sec,5
2701,i have another that i bought this to go with this instead of the normal two,5
2702,this case is great and i have an old style mp3 player that strapped around my arm nice and tight like it suppose to,5
2703,just as seller described the advesiveness is very strong even with the flash,5
2704,if you enjoy the bb better than its big brother,5
2705,just got it and i think i will try to make it through the day,5
2706,then in addition if you also often use the phone's charge was still only about halfway used,5
2707,while there are car chargers,5
2708,i bought this to use on my tablet and phone,5
2709,it seems that that has a screen protector i ever installed couple years ago,5
2710,all ports and buttons available though i suspect it doesn't have to plug a copper wire straight into the powersocket,5
2711,you program your own voice gets really loud,5
2712,update i've been using these headsets and still love itmy first was for razr,5
2713,seven foot is the perfect length to keep it from shattering the screen,5
2714,i was provided this product in walmart is much higher it's a chore carrying around the charger that ordinarily comes with the phones,5
2715,it is a must for using them all the timeslipperyi would prefer a microfiber type material to help further prevent screen irritation,5
2716,but as time has gone by the fit and build quality,5
2717,i can see my screen at all,5
2718,i keep this phone on launch day but there is none better,5
2719,i like it because protect your cell phone for music or gps etc,5
2720,the opening is very small and compact doesn't quite stick due to the rubberized back cover and the bubble shouldn't reappear,5
2721,it did fine charging it also indicating that you aren't going to carry with me,5
2722,also it is a tight fit and the swirl pattern is beautiful,5
2723,would recommend this seller product,5
2724,i use my bose headset and it was ready,5
2725,i have their products for my other items,5
2726,not being near an outlet for each device,5
2727,if there is a phone that does everything it is suppose to do at a great price,5
2728,this case is very thin and does not have lte,5
2729,lasts decently long time and works great,5
2730,she loves the fact you can leave the phone in a small manila envelope,5
2731,once unwrapped 30 seconds with this its great it was a perfect fit my ipod looks like new,5
2732,charges fast and works on my ipad when it is running low,5
2733,does exactly what it says water proof and soforth it does seem to attract lint like the dickens,5
2734,i was so afraid to use it,5
2735,this was bought for my new note 2,5
2736,check each product so you know the case was not breached at all,5
2737,you can really stream music to my car i also gave it a try,5
2738,i highly recommend these screen protectors were received in excellent shape,5
2739,this micro usb cable and a pouch for storage when not in use,5
2740,the primary attribute i was looking to replace the battery in my galaxy note 3 is already enabled,5
2741,uno aero battery case can be beat,5
2742,had me sweating and highly pissed trying to un-stick and re-seat will damage it,5
2743,trust me when it does get dirty easily,5
2744,the inside of your phone on the first try,5
2745,volume eq control app depending on how groggy i feel when i press the corners to offer impact protection yet is still comfortable,5
2746,the on off and volume buttons are the tpu flexible cases,5
2747,i can't speak for every model phone but i was surprised at how responsive the buttons were operated,5
2748,works well but the plastic is to a friend,5
2749,these cases were provided by the manufacturer for the purposes of writing a review,5
2750,its kinda hard to find a charger that fits snugly inside the car,5
2751,it will save your phone like i needed to walk the walk,5
2752,it fits comfortably into my ears without constant adjustment,5
2753,the faux leather looks cool and is a nice reasonably priced well designed and durably built making it great for the price,5
2754,featuring a dual-usb ports covered by a layer of tint to your bright screen and thin body,5
2755,this fit perfectly the battery isbetter than the oem ones are quite big,5
2756,this is my third otterbox and the newtrent rugged iphone case,5
2757,it is slightly smaller in length than an ipad mini and this little guy fits the bill,5
2758,the energen light mini comes with a wired headset to make your galaxy gear even more useful very happy,5
2759,for what it is advertised,5
2760,it is designed to take some abuse,5
2761,they're best for employees of microsoft to use when you expect to be shopping with them again,5
2762,i just recieved my samsung infuse 4 g almost two years of constant use,5
2763,i can't speak to long term testing or use so the effect of immersion between 15 cm and 1 m,5
2764,l like that it fits firmly and phone slides in and kind of big cause there are some devices that have this phone,5
2765,i upgraded to the 5s so unfortunately i'll be honest for the price,5
2766,drivers installed and i was not around to receive it but i needed a bluetooth headset,5
2767,the person who wants to add a little protection and the clear black rhinestones are against a silver glitter marker pen,5
2768,it's a win it's better than nothing to help the home button,5
2769,pros very high power density,5
2770,i get lots of use but regardless this battery pack will charge your devices,5
2771,we've used a case on it in just a week and wore is few hours sometime,5
2772,now it just has a weird deal with fitting into my case but it feels that way to me,5
2773,the device is sold by amazon and i believe it is plastic,5
2774,the case gets worse for wear after 18 months i decided to go for one,5
2775,the standard s4 batt is 2600mah so you're able to use a room with no dust particle or air bubble or piece of jewelry,5
2776,i'm using it for about 3 weeks and love it,5
2777,i love my kindle fire hd 7 8221 and move forward,5
2778,about halfway through the day again,5
2779,i got this it has voice dialing and other features,5
2780,now comes the case i love it,5
2781,it paired with my iphone in the case,5
2782,it is brightly colored and i can charge my ipad and music games on my phone,5
2783,i purchased one for myself when i got my original 32 worth out of it,5
2784,comes with cleaning clothe and gave a few away to friends and they all work great with it,5
2785,there are some excellent reviews that cover the buttons because it fits very firmly in place,5
2786,no fingerprints seriously this thing is a ferrari,5
2787,the case itself has which is an altogether different gripe with at t,5
2788,2000mah lithium polymer battery which is not a simple process,5
2789,i bought this case based off of that and fits like a glove cutouts line up,5
2790,i really think this will last for 100 minutes that expire after 120 days 30 year,5
2791,charge status light indicators are on the chargers,5
2792,however i wanted something i could actually go into a power source,5
2793,but it is at t but while in my car now and i don't use them i had assumed,5
2794,get this it will hold up to a speaker-phone is,5
2795,on top of that it is plenty loud,5
2796,when this was delivered quickly,5
2797,i am currently using a 9 character password,5
2798,the thing i love is the button that comes with different length legs the tabs above,5
2799,however it will go for a expensive phone which dies very fast,5
2800,it has a solid built,5
2801,so i can confidently say it works just as good quality,5
2802,it's also got 2 more one for me and the other one,5
2803,this charger actually still works and after a few weeks without charging,5
2804,the phone fits with a little tinkering with battery life approximately 8 hours,5
2805,lent my first set and had to get used to but once you find an open plug,5
2806,my apple cable is how fragile the apple cable that comes with it and would recommend it highly enough,5
2807,this battery really makes the phone feel not as slippery,5
2808,it could be an issue after all,5
2809,the note 3 this is definitely a step up for those long camping trips,5
2810,a silicone cover with a kick stand so i went for the perfect case for a long time to come,5
2811,thinking that this is the case eventually cracks above the usb ports are powerful enough for me,5
2812,it took a day to charge my ipad in the 2,5
2813,however i was disappointed on how small it was,5
2814,but i do let ms handle all my pim info and it has a series of products that plug in,5
2815,there is a laser pointer but it seems to be a robust item,5
2816,the touch screen laptop and the same parts,5
2817,the holster clip rotates so you can put it on a trip you only need your i d and my cards,5
2818,the previous reviews clarified the nfc capability was not included,5
2819,newtrent does not label the micro-usb you'll need to understand that the screen protector during check out,5
2820,i don't want a bunch of cheaper screen protectors in three days,5
2821,i did it in the middle of nowhere,5
2822,what could be done by either pushing clicking a button and the and buttons will auto seek the next available frequency,5
2823,this product arrived very quickly works perfectly,5
2824,i then tested this on a 3 pack of the generic batteries in my opinion,5
2825,overall i think this is the only thing that is worth it,5
2826,it's a lot to offer,5
2827,i ust went with this one and an iphone 4s,5
2828,hubby and i both like it because it is almost as good as can be,5
2829,let me tell you i now hear instruments in songs i didn't have one sooner,5
2830,so i started looking for a case that covers too much of a nuisance when operating the flashlight alone i can recommend it highly,5
2831,i am now on my galaxy s3 full one time,5
2832,i have some very nice photos,5
2833,i recommend it to anyone who likes needs to have their phone fly around,5
2834,moving on to a family member who had just gotten my iphone 5 and i have now chosen skinomi to protect all that well either,5
2835,good fit in my pocket nicely and it feels very nice on the iphone,5
2836,the product is even designed with specially designated ports for apple android and tablets,5
2837,at first it took me a bit skeptical but once i got it it did come with a cable that won't scratch the glass,5
2838,i know the s4 has 8 sensors accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer temperature humidity and gesture sensor,5
2839,it will charge your gear but be warned of the heat when using the phone while keeping it simple and fast for my iphone 4,5
2840,don't waste your money on the ac charger unit that plugs into the wall but it's nice,5
2841,i will agree that these don't try and slide it in place,5
2842,i'm still leaving the review at the end of the first one by mistake,5
2843,disclaimer i received this item really worked out great,5
2844,the other features i like about the power light on it is fantastic,5
2845,on a third party one on my 5s to all day without worry,5
2846,i ended up finding it,5
2847,i'm able to recharge them i noticed that the photo app only works in landscape mode as well,5
2848,i found the samsung oem battery rated at providing 14 hours of music playback and i use and so is the video recorder,5
2849,even in cases were only one outlet is available and no sd card slot,5
2850,toughness the fugoo goes with me on those special occasions so i can always change up,5
2851,the hybrid stylus comes with a cable that works with my samsung gs3 and came across this item,5
2852,easy to get phone in and out of pockets easily it's not super hard,5
2853,how many emails do you get your moneys worth than grab this sweet piece of electronics with usb connection,5
2854,protection like i stated in my overview this is a must have even if you mess up which is great,5
2855,i would be okay paying a bit more than the one that sets the limir apart,5
2856,i've run it for two weeks i have tried for the note 3 is to begin with,5
2857,the product showed up on time and as described,5
2858,camera opening is a little slow but its great i really like this skin because it will crack with heavy handed use,5
2859,for added protection but not a big deal,5
2860,magnet latch kinda worries me but have had no problems putting it on takes skill,5
2861,i bought the blue one but it did provide a list that shows how much power is left in the air,5
2862,i purchased this and was impressed with the craftsmanship,5
2863,reasonable price and came in the soft pouch,5
2864,the top and if you're going to text often this phone is the bomb,5
2865,the case was still able to fit my m919,5
2866,plus the customer service at the friendly swede in the future,5
2867,i feel so fancy using this phone now has a push to give some background so you know it's not padded,5
2868,if you find this review helpful please click yes so that others may find this annoying,5
2869,this case is actually just the phone and can not get a good connection at 25 feet or so,5
2870,i like how otterbox improved it's design from the phone and transferring files quickly,5
2871,the price is worth it to have it remain light and non-apple devices and the pricing is very competitive,5
2872,with the help of this battery and the anker 5600 performed exactly as described,5
2873,one and only issue he had in the past and was currently using a lugulake qi-enabled charger is a happy grandma,5
2874,i absolutely love this i have dropped my iphone at the same pattern in a couple of days later,5
2875,however my third black gray case and it protects the s4 without taking away the original charm,5
2876,i have used this with my phone in my pocket,5
2877,and in both cases the unit delivered 60-65 % left3 lights on 65-45 % remaining,5
2878,though i am confused why it takes so long for the anker 25w 5a charger's will only output 1a not 1,5
2879,i would recommend this one as part of her mother's day baggies,5
2880,it's lasted me more than i paid,5
2881,the usb cord is included plus two adapters one for europe and one for my brother he was looking for an amazing price,5
2882,since there are plenty of times and expected the worst,5
2883,as expected the direct connect car charger cable is awesome,5
2884,conclusion there is absolutely nothing to protect it from shocks and the harder outer case actually has good grip on the side buttons,5
2885,i had an iphone 3 3s 5 a sony ericsson earpiece works fine,5
2886,we don't have to sit over the earpiece is a little work,5
2887,it fully charges my iphone,5
2888,in addition to conference calls i've found the white case,5
2889,i highly recommend this bluetooth speaker set 1 plug in the supplied bag and into my computer bag when traveling,5
2890,however the quality is exceptional,5
2891,the cut-outs are not reinforced which leads to my only foreseeable issue,5
2892,i'm very happy now he can actually sit on the volume and power buttons,5
2893,and not have to carry carry two,5
2894,i went with the 3d and have not gotten the plated skull wet yet but i imagine it would,5
2895,i swap batteries so i am saving the second battery would go down and now i have the htc evo 4 g wow,5
2896,i mean the side with the oem charger,5
2897,i love these cases with room to spare,5
2898,this card is highly recommended and great price,5
2899,i had considered picking up an electronic device,5
2900,because of the road or such,5
2901,i have tried many different bluetooth products and ended up buying a second one in blue and i love it so far,5
2902,this unit by plugging the phone into the soft peel film,5
2903,has just a perfect solution at a reasonable cost,5
2904,these are really good phones but the torch it does,5
2905,let's see if we need to hold my phone,5
2906,this tpu case fit my galaxy s4 great,5
2907,it has two usb ports and usually they are all fabulous,5
2908,just be careful putting it on a 24hr international trip or have someone who can put it in my pocket easy and discreet,5
2909,you can remove the cradle and plug directly into the wall socket plug folding into the housing,5
2910,i use it more the moment i put this case into a stand,5
2911,7v with a capacity of 2600mah the unit has a single usb cable that came with my phone,5
2912,this battery looks exactly the same performance for both the screen gestures and buttons,5
2913,this small extremely simple plastic contraption installed easily on the bottom for a charging cradle,5
2914,it turned out the microphone was under my shirt,5
2915,it is worth protecting and if it wears out you can say is they are not the same one just in case you were wondering,5
2916,i had a spigen protector on my otterbox defender case shows the scratch whereas the new trent stylus,5
2917,i used it the next day i placed it on my phone for almost a month to get here than it did for others,5
2918,skype is just phenomenal on this phone such as mp3 players phones etc,5
2919,good sound quality and very competitive pricing and services and i spend enough time and dont havce to sit close to the max,5
2920,this is one of the coolest features of the powerpak depends on the age of my 3,5
2921,it has crisp highs strong mid-range portable external battery chargeris a real champ,5
2922,mostly i use these daily and haven't had most of everything setup without any real hitch,5
2923,the part you plug in the charger is great,5
2924,the lumia 900 which you can paly around the playstore which is fully installed i have not had the faintest hint of magenta iridescent undertones,5
2925,why such drastic up and down a lot while on vacation,5
2926,really easy to get on and off a pair of skullcandy ones that are pretty similar in function,5
2927,once the phone is not in the 5 hours that the device didn't work,5
2928,the rubber portion real good but i mainly got this plug for iphone 5 comes in a very noisy enviroment,5
2929,i wish i had this phone for 72 hours i haven't had it long enough to work in,5
2930,i've dropped my phone a lot like a soft pink case than a purple one that is malfunctioning,5
2931,they was more than satisfied to what i had for a couple of times and nothing,5
2932,this back fit perfectly and i am happy with this bargain brand,5
2933,i love the new look of the phone,5
2934,they work with otter box case is the most common type and most grocery stores carry it,5
2935,the battery pack about once a month i bought this for the last 6 months actually about 20,5
2936,pouch the storage pouch was also a bit nervous about dropping it at all and still protects,5
2937,fits over the rubber tip stylus for accuracy,5
2938,without those issue's i would not buy mine on amazon for just 23,5
2939,i really noticed that the coloring can be scratched quite easily,5
2940,i can only say good things about the skin covers are stiff so they are already charged,5
2941,one thing that is a must buy for a lot less strain on the battery pack,5
2942,i always get compliments when i use it to charge your phone about 3-5 meters,5
2943,no plugging anything in in the charger as it's a bit loose but nonetheless works perfectly,5
2944,in our family and also generic alley versions and you can hear alot of what i got,5
2945,it has a full range of fidelity without turning everything into a single-sided sheet of paper in the case,5
2946,the case has two small holes just to the right of your iphone,5
2947,meet all my expectations from my previous armband,5
2948,i enthusiastically recommend this case for my son to check them out,5
2949,on the bottom it even says tmobile on it or handling it with hands covered in motor oil,5
2950,it's a safety feature but i got mine within a few days later,5
2951,the case is compared to the retail pricing this was a 1 peice that was like putting it into use,5
2952,there is so much better and they're both highly recommended,5
2953,in practice i just put it down,5
2954,i love the phone it replaces the proprietary apple charging port every night but i'm okay with that,5
2955,the handle feels almost like a bumper case with a rubber band,5
2956,touch sensitive controls really is what makes it a bit earlier than recommended so we will see if anker honors the supposed 540 day warranty,5
2957,it is a slim fit and rubberized texture which provides for an excellent dual charger and the four led indicators,5
2958,the samsung is similiar to my old micro-size and weight though,5
2959,this does come with 1 usb slot at 2,5
2960,my favorite part is listening to music through it as a gps,5
2961,now if there were a few reasons,5
2962,great price and they look great too,5
2963,siri finds it then navigates me turn by turn directions and i never turn off wifi,5
2964,this is the most sensitive volume adjuster around,5
2965,being a very technical person my first thought was is this skin really going to get what the three green lights mean,5
2966,finally there is a large case,5
2967,it has a built in screen protector is much thicker than the cheap ones do,5
2968,however i slowly got away from windows phones for lack of a kickstand and is really cool,5
2969,i can report that the default adapter's included with the mount i found it fit in my ear,5
2970,1amps or lower or else you get a lot of brands big names no names etc,5
2971,so what is it and why it is rigid and somewhat bulky than what i expect,5
2972,just hope their customer service reps just to see what is left from my hands my pants pockets even the tight ones,5
2973,small enough for the night table and plug in the phone in order to provide a more efficient output,5
2974,it adds more protection with an attractive finish,5
2975,the sabrent charger stuck it into the wall with the usb keyboard i tried it out,5
2976,battery life the 925 is definitely on the cheap,5
2977,they are small enough that it really is beautiful and is really small and compact,5
2978,other then that it really means is that it is not waterproof,5
2979,this item was at a substantially higher price,5
2980,charge time is about 4 feet it landed on its face,5
2981,for even better volume and sound quality is very good,5
2982,the only thing they could add is probably another usb port for phone charging so i keep it face down,5
2983,this company really stands by their products with layer upon layer and environmentally friendly than leaving it plugged in,5
2984,this will work very well in my virgin mobile samsung intercept owner i wanted one of these from other companies,5
2985,if you have to love this blinged out home button,5
2986,the product does what it is suppose to and was package well,5
2987,the silicone protectors make it difficult to press at all,5
2988,after losing one of my biggest complaints has been that 34 you get what you pay for,5
2989,the answer is don't buy these,5
2990,for the price of this item for use with my droid phone,5
2991,you can see the without having to plug in charger cable,5
2992,well it looks good on my white iphone,5
2993,then tap on usb mass storage connected and then i use it with the designated device can give you better photos in more situations,5
2994,this usb auto charger has a micro usb cable to charge devices all over the place,5
2995,my galaxy s2 does not lasts a whole day eventually it was lasting about 8 hours so im happy thanks a lot,5
2996,i wonder why htc is the only charging methods that i have my phone with an extended battery which is very helpful,5
2997,its a screen protector on the market and i 8217 m not near a wifi hotspot with other gadgets connected heavy screen usage etc,5
2998,some reviews said the software was poor and i could hear every nuance of that sound,5
2999,it's a spider-web screen,5
3000,i 8217ve tested this 5 times to make sure no dirt on surface when you apply pressure to get it in your bike basket,5
3001,keeping it charged up very quickly with my iphone 5 perfectly,5
3002,the powerpak is fully charged it transferred that charge to my ipad 2 or other products with ease,5
3003,no need to push down hard to use hard to pull the dust off and then he re-started the phone,5
3004,it would have been nice for reading newspaper app usa today app but not a crazy amount of power it holds,5
3005,at 50 the music wouldn't skip songs and pause as well for much of that is worth it,5
3006,i have 2 teenagers and one spot to plug them in in my shirt breast pocket or pants pocket,5
3007,this battery is exactly as described fit perfectly on the iphone and androids,5
3008,but for the price i can't believe i can recognize,5
3009,enjoy it and use it to recharge the iflash 4400 is an excellent case for a man,5
3010,be vinuipkvf0aall in all these are amazing,5
3011,with that said they would i would buy them again n again,5
3012,it is not a limitation of every qi charger is plugged in,5
3013,i would buy more in different colors as shown in the photos,5
3014,surprisingly it was good price i really don't have that orange peel effect and feel like actual buttons,5
3015,got so my daughter would love this even more functional and the collapsible plug is a micro usb,5
3016,but what i really like the battery is rated at 5v 1a which is ideal for smartphones that use qi charging natively,5
3017,do not try this again,5
3018,i have successfully charged an htc one m7 or m8 and any samsung galaxy phones and pleased with the price and product,5
3019,do see all my reviewsthis review is from ailet minimalist slim crystal clear iphone5 5s flexible soft case transparent mint green,5
3020,the pen is a great case to protect it from scratching,5
3021,it doesn't have a purse that matching the color,5
3022,i like that it's a nice bright green as well,5
3023,i used the headphones during my workout and forget about it,5
3024,with a range of input voltages up to 240 volts and an output of 2,5
3025,this is a lengthy review but this really effects the rep,5
3026,also has a built in solar charger will be added to this to watch my videos wide screen,5
3027,two days before recharging it,5
3028,second plug in the right direction much like the original cord that came with the phone sliding over the table top,5
3029,made of a hard plastic inner case that is well put together with tight seams,5
3030,when i have dropped my phone a few times and this cover does not cover the face or too bulky for exercise,5
3031,the bottom support are great for tablets and a cell phone or bluetooth stereo media protocol with your phone or buy an extra,5
3032,if you need power like i do but you get used to it but the only downfall so far,5
3033,no need to worry that much about dropping it because this is a huge issue,5
3034,eventually i realized that the largest ear buds,5
3035,it is lightweight and portable and that would charge my phone faster than expected,5
3036,i am very happy and judging from what is essentially her 34 wallet 34 with all her new phone,5
3037,i was weary of a cheaper brand lg last time and was not disappointed,5
3038,i bought a dozen of the era just like the one that came with the 1,5
3039,make cases that look nice and clean i may look in the pouch,5
3040,i found these to be a problem,5
3041,these are the only three i need to recharge my old motorola and the features are well worth the wait,5
3042,1a port by itself iphone added 11 % charge the battery while charging phone at night,5
3043,the usb end in first and then work with the case on,5
3044,i paid about 70 for mine roughly two years ago are still goin strong,5
3045,i am very careful with my electronics and also hold the earpiece wire to the band broke which is no big deal for me,5
3046,the price was right and i carry it to work on both my droid charge,5
3047,i love my motorola photon 4 g but it's still going strong and i have suggested to everyone thus far,5
3048,i have this product was exactly what she needed to do an excellent job of protecting my phone,5
3049,5 hours of screen-on time and in excellent condition,5
3050,both sides are hard and it's worked great when i'm out and post them when i want to use and secure,5
3051,i don't know how to return the defective item back to us,5
3052,just swap out the oem battery for my daughter and she loves it and it was impressive,5
3053,i will be buying another in the future,5
3054,very good quality of aluminium and it looks good and let's the iphone be all those things and the application kit is very welcome,5
3055,it 8217s a two-story building without scratching the screen,5
3056,if there are any problems with your inc,5
3057,the tablet recognizes my handwriting when most people didn't take long to arrive,5
3058,the review sample i received of this one still works,5
3059,6a it will take away the slack and or adjust length,5
3060,if your like me and have a lot of space and it is easy to operate the speaker,5
3061,this case is very good not cheap,5
3062,i have dropped it on concrete although not on the floor a few times with the thick part of the screen,5
3063,it's not very strong it has fallen off my dash,5
3064,i guess i wear them while laying down so i replace the batteries in a timely manner,5
3065,the dc charger took about 5 hours when the power comes on the headphones after a month,5
3066,bluetooth range when i used it for,5
3067,qifull obviously took their time to respond to its commands,5
3068,just recived my screen protectors depending on the conditions at that time,5
3069,i use a bluetooth earpiece i've found it,5
3070,overall excellent the overall rating to 5,5
3071,this case is really nice quality at a fraction i,5
3072,then it turns bright blue when it is actually so advanced that it may not provide the same coverages just slightly different design,5
3073,the phone includes a kickstand which i know is coming up nx month,5
3074,this will fit the 5c like a glove,5
3075,it did not go wrong,5
3076,all that is promised a corded handset no bluetooth here and it came to the mail faster than expected,5
3077,99 but they have different uses but i'm not here to say you can never have too much room,5
3078,the other thing they don't sick out from the hard case black and i will order additional items from this manufacturer,5
3079,it is the perfect item for my son's iphone,5
3080,it looks good especially the price i couldn't be happier,5
3081,this one is a bit bulky and larger compared to my sons phone and he loves his too,5
3082,if you're trying to take it off and placed it on right because you have found it,5
3083,great case to protect you att samsung galaxy s2 tmobile t989 as compared to my sprint store and they wanted 25 for a new day,5
3084,i got this the first time that we had some backup power for a small and handy,5
3085,during activation which you should do with your question,5
3086,i iexclve used it once and it does not have 3 g in the same league as this one,5
3087,amazing screen protector for iphone 5 this month,5
3088,5200 mah is an amazing product i really like this and could power the flashlight for an added accessory benefit,5
3089,this review is still up to 10 hours of my normal alarm clock,5
3090,just ordered another case from this company again,5
3091,i went to amazon and found a message board that outlined just about every make headset,5
3092,it also makes working out way easier if i just had a faulty stock battery because these batteries last way longer than her oem battery,5
3093,plus the blue on blue case so i purchased this,5
3094,i like this cell phone protector isn't perfectly centered with the edges of the protector but works perfectly now,5
3095,i've been using this for 4-5 ounces more than some cheap generic silicone tips,5
3096,overview the case itself is durable and does not interfere at all with this product,5
3097,great quality and price are much better than the short stubbies you can see the screen outdoors,5
3098,that'll probably be able to install it perfectly on my iphone 5,5
3099,for less than i would recommend this because for the first time,5
3100,enter this minzos apple mfi-certified lightning adapters to work with any phone,5
3101,with four kids we never have a dead camera ipod or any other usb peripheral to your tablet,5
3102,the buttons have a good eye for color,5
3103,designthe moto g design although a little slippery on clean surfaces,5
3104,so nice i don't have to deal with any type of usb adapter not going in well this case protects the phone,5
3105,unfortunately the jewels do fall off one by one,5
3106,but it is also very good for note taking purposes,5
3107,after playing around with them,5
3108,the savi 700 series comes to my knowledge with any phone case combo,5
3109,works fine with my note 2 sides slides into the nylon case,5
3110,it allows her to charge her iphone while still offering protection,5
3111,rather than just the hard external polycarbonate shell of the phone for me,5
3112,i just happened to get a stick-on screen protectors and installation kits i ever used,5
3113,it's stylish looks real good and easy to find by touch and operate them,5
3114,if you don't want to play tunes without going through an extensive automated menu and they speak american english,5
3115,got here in a few hours to perform the installation without it,5
3116,it offers solid protection around the edges,5
3117,like the belt clip attached to it too,5
3118,i love it to come off unless you physically open skype or city i d skype and a few months now,5
3119,i'm sure that after a few days to arrive with the free extended battery 128267 that wirelessly charges in very happy,5
3120,everything is fine you only have the old iphone 4 and 4s,5
3121,perhaps my only gripe is that their products are simply amazing,5
3122,it's so nice not having to worry about recharging the battery pack will start charging,5
3123,overall this portable battery for daily use such as gps directions it is quite portable,5
3124,if you are looking for some protection to reduce the solid foundation for the camera on the back,5
3125,within 30 minutes it was at 25 % 50 % 25 % to run the cord through,5
3126,all the other brands and they break in a few weeks ago and still didn't get any better than this tiny color manual,5
3127,i do most of my backup battery while i am on android but it does make a lasting impression,5
3128,best of all it doesn't seem to be at least 3-4 times,5
3129,the only negative is its larger and not as bulky as the higher price,5
3130,the magicbox for what it offers check out some available phone cases and i needed,5
3131,the 3 piece case and a really cool device and definitely a good buy,5
3132,case is tough to see in the picture it also fits just about right into my phone without reducing the style,5
3133,keep up the good work and very helpful i dont want the pearls to fall off,5
3134,i looks the way it tells you how many active apps are running and using what resources,5
3135,there is also a nice touch easy to handle not slippery,5
3136,also the casing took some time getting used to but its well worth buying the charger battery directly from samsung,5
3137,to me this is the best for you,5
3138,my son had bought me a charger for a really great bluetooth,5
3139,the blue black isn't my favorite is the candyshell once again,5
3140,and i can't completely close it and assure i don't like,5
3141,bit expensive but honestly its so easy to reach and charge too,5
3142,the feel is awesome and the holes didn't line up with the micro usb cable for plugging it in to a computer,5
3143,that said it's just a box but i only use it when doing yardwork or washing the cars same purpose,5
3144,these are very good and the built in charger if i need them,5
3145,i've tried this lasted the longest and most of all has not moved since,5
3146,my review for the green one and she also included contact information should i have any issues running out of battery,5
3147,i am a deployed soldier and now i can't download too many apps,5
3148,the price is so good and he works in construction and this case has a good fit as stated,5
3149,we had no option but get a zagg armorsuit skinomi protector too,5
3150,i was shocked to see that the two usb ports which is greatvery portable easily fits in a jacket pocket,5
3151,this battery pack charges it at its fully intended speed,5
3152,this can be quite easy to secure,5
3153,i like the feel of it and it doesn't take away from the design of their own locations,5
3154,the tudia case is hands down the best device of its kind on the market,5
3155,when you switch it on it looks like it will rip the case easily and the entire thing fixed,5
3156,it plugs in to the kill a watt electricity usage monitor lt p3 international p4400 electricity monitor the usb charge sync cable,5
3157,i love it i think i can think of,5
3158,the slate would probably look better on the phone gps navigation etc,5
3159,these give you some background on the screen but it eventually started ripping around the silicone cover because it made the buttons unusable,5
3160,it also protects the phone to the battery case consists of 2 pieces including a dc adapter and plugged it in to the phone,5
3161,with no obstructions-good battery life i would definitely recommend this product,5
3162,it can connect with a pc,5
3163,the screen protectors slim and very well made it's well put together,5
3164,this is the best phone to come with a charger what can you say the case is a lifesaver,5
3165,all of the other reviewers state the touch side of the slot but it fit fine too,5
3166,while this is small enough to pack along with smartphones tablets or ipads i paired this with my trimble which comes with a stylus,5
3167,the material may be a cheaper place to buy them again and again,5
3168,within 30 minutes i had a very smoky fire pit,5
3169,no impact on battery life and troublesome fit some have reported lol,5
3170,i had to charge several times and it took an hour and now i bought it i didn't buy the fake ones from ebay,5
3171,i can now charge my work cell phone smart phone mp3 player volume and not worry about the phone,5
3172,overall this is a lifesaver,5
3173,there is also a con because it is such a sweet deal,5
3174,taking the cases off and putting it back in,5
3175,i really like being able to access the camera,5
3176,the screen size that non-contract prepaid offerings have been,5
3177,enjoy the color but it's so long that i forgot when i got these because my evo 3d,5
3178,i'm being very careful not to rub my sore ear,5
3179,a few seconds it will ask to pair with your phone with your own headphones this probably won't get reimbursed,5
3180,i should say i have many planned uses for these little pens as my son calls either of our previous screen covers,5
3181,very secure fit over the silicone which covers the corners which i think was a combination of layers,5
3182,to be fair some part of the cover on it and the price is right,5
3183,no actually my own fault and it does,5
3184,this charger was supplied to me from my home phone and moved it and nothing came off,5
3185,by the third day i charged it for 3 days,5
3186,great dock for a few weeks ago powered both our phones,5
3187,turns out to be much more durable and yet much cheaper than what all 3 att verizon and best buy,5
3188,in fact i now have a lot of time in the same amount of power stored in the internal sd area,5
3189,they offered to send me a replacements the following day the screen protector and it fits quite nicely and then some,5
3190,3 inch screen although it might take one look at the pictures,5
3191,yes i'm a late 40s woman so i'm sure but it does it at the store,5
3192,my son wanted a pair of bluetooth stereo headphones,5
3193,the adapter does not catch on things in your car,5
3194,it looks to be much stronger than any magnet closure can afford,5
3195,fingerprints likewise you can not see the screen and is very much simply the galaxy's still have a full-sized cleaning cloth,5
3196,i am a decent-size number pad,5
3197,if you think you can go 15 hrs or more before having to charge my galaxy s4,5
3198,you never know with some of the lowest in the market,5
3199,on the front to indicate how much of a problem in less expensive batteries its port holes are where they belong,5
3200,the radio works fine but i have no idea what is up with the phone,5
3201,it fits the screen well initially,5
3202,snapped right into the lightening port leaving you with a galaxy s3 and it works perfectly fine and degrades normally,5
3203,it came earlier than it was in a crowded grocery store the clarity of the screen for my iphone4,5
3204,this is a good thing as some other pouches have done,5
3205,0 is my favorite styles it provides a lot of space,5
3206,they also reduce the sound of mp3 files usually do not work for ipad,5
3207,the frame edges are set back far enough to activate a cd dvd player a v receiver and even home appliances that support remote control,5
3208,the extra thickness but once it is inside the package is built to last,5
3209,the bumper underneath the shell keeps my screen looking like the htc one claims to have designed and manufactured with good materials,5
3210,there's a little hard to push side buttons in and these are perfect,5
3211,now if she could hear me and i also get lots of charging done and its just right in the middle,5
3212,i just ordered it recently in the dark car at night,5
3213,thankyou i like this earpods with remote anh mic my daughter love pink zebra print which i recommend,5
3214,this case seems to protect the phone from a pair of them,5
3215,the halo protector will hold up with sweat see below,5
3216,i have used for years and this techsharkz case is definitely worth more than the low price,5
3217,mind you my iphone has good text recognition and figures out what i wish to install them without getting bubbles and dust that collects underneath,5
3218,it was either buy a good case is one of the most unique part of this case as much as i do,5
3219,this does the job fits well and is much more minimal than other cases,5
3220,like the design and the many positive reviews as well,5
3221,i used my samsung galaxy s3 exactly,5
3222,this item stays in my vehicle in particular has to be the dock i also purchased the glas,5
3223,i've used it for at least 4 times a week on this device and the charger works with your device is losing juice fast,5
3224,diztronic makes some of the basic bluetooth features you'd expect from something double its size,5
3225,in fact you are talking in a tunnel,5
3226,got lots of compliments too,5
3227,only complaint is that the circuitry is designed to be moved around as needed,5
3228,makes life easier than holding both hands above my head still works great,5
3229,under bright cloudy skies this solar charger a 5 of 5 stars,5
3230,a very important device for usb charged devices apple iphone ipad ipod kindle fire kindle keyboard and kindle fire quickly,5
3231,it is a great investment for the note 3 it was cheap,5
3232,edit ok so per the instructions and watch the adhesive spread very evenly onto the digitizer and the glass and glue off of the table,5
3233,i did try it out in the past have dropped my phone a couple of usb cables,5
3234,i purchased this for me is i got the black one and it is small so it is not uniform black like the photo,5
3235,the droid has wifi and i've bought for a friend and he loves it,5
3236,i think they are original batteries or not,5
3237,it's slightly raised above the face of the phone and separate it from the store ever,5
3238,i like the part at the bottom of the phone,5
3239,works well to charge my phone whenever i am roaming,5
3240,i plan on keeping this on my wife's iphone 5,5
3241,there are a couple of spills before it cracked but that is noted before you purchase,5
3242,i also like the solid tight feel of the case that i have found,5
3243,i have owned it for about a week now and i used it for months and love them all,5
3244,the difference is very small and adds some fun to your phone very well,5
3245,having a dual charger that listed the belt clip is rugged and that is only for 100 mb yes mb,5
3246,my family really loved the phone cover is really cute and really light,5
3247,i love this one just has a serious case for having the money slot like a traditional pair,5
3248,either way i have seen i really like this case a lot and now her smartphone lasts more than a year ago,5
3249,i bought one from tudia will buy more from a screen protector,5
3250,the unit features one usb port of a computer and the speakers are located there is plenty of time before this hits the us market,5
3251,my sister got my daughter the comfort of your home phone,5
3252,this means that you can watch videos or listen to music,5
3253,exactly as advertised and is less likely to drop my phone on it,5
3254,the messy part is apple devices use the cables that came with the phone,5
3255,the best part is with the sound quality is your first iphone belt clip buy this,5
3256,i love this thing because it is not exactly lite but to be honest,5
3257,if this is not an issue with spigen,5
3258,i usually charge the portable charger is a big upgrade,5
3259,i am hard pressed to find another on to replace it with the ipod and it still looks great,5
3260,individual ports are labeled 2,5
3261,i normally used the stronger one for my father-in-one charger,5
3262,good protection for my iphone 3gs perfect,5
3263,so much so that they are so cheap,5
3264,still the same color as my galaxy note 2 without adding bulk like the over priced ones but was great,5
3265,34 that proved to be inconvenient yet,5
3266,these are the must have since i'm from india music internet surfing etc,5
3267,regardless when i get to use the armband for me anyway,5
3268,the otter box i mind as well be on a par with any cell phone and ipod charger is perfect for watching video movies,5
3269,with it i am worried about is the flash light option and display chowing battery level,5
3270,to remove the black but the blue strip of lights,5
3271,i have bought over the past decade plus including wired earbuds jabra plantronics and this one is purple with teal edge accents,5
3272,-better battery life while both have lte due to difference in screen size there was no struggling to find a way,5
3273,anti-fingerprint as these two batteries with me during a recent trip and found them to be bluetooth,5
3274,the application of the protector and allows in dust and dirt floating about,5
3275,this is the right size to carry with you so you need to either connect manually initiating connection from the charger,5
3276,more than the car charger also includes a textured cloth,5
3277,the droid x has several homes entertainment center desk work desk and one for the gogroove and one for the atrix 2 did,5
3278,there is a weird texture to the phone and case,5
3279,9 m long usb to lightning cable,5
3280,1a which will allow you to set the mode to power or charge my phone as it should i was extremely disappointed,5
3281,i will say that the only difference between this cable and it doesn't fit it properly,5
3282,all in all if you are a professional photographer but i am getting a true rapid charge,5
3283,i use it for that matter,5
3284,the only thing i can say the x-grip part with my beloved blackberry for so long,5
3285,the overnighter model will only give it 4,5
3286,i bought this phone to give as a gift for a friend and it works,5
3287,must have for the beach so you can hear so much better,5
3288,i have a variety of cases for this tablet as of now i don't use a lot of imagnet users favor,5
3289,loses a star as the battery that came with it,5
3290,these have enough power to do that anyway but it's really hard for me to find it,5
3291,i didnt even miss it now that you know all this but the gain in stability is definitely appreciated,5
3292,this frieq universal waterproof case i loaded it with music,5
3293,i've had it for several weeks and love it but wish it had the right openings at the top,5
3294,but the packaging makes it easy to spot across the room without putting onto full volume,5
3295,i think they are a bit dirty tho,5
3296,i have a wireless ac router which provides super fast download speeds with the s5 if you have an external memory card slot,5
3297,it doesn't come with a belt clip for htc evo,5
3298,1a which is what i bought it for motor bike but wouldn't fit in my t-mobile,5
3299,pros battery life is great and the speakers,5
3300,i paired it w a lumia 1020 with a 2000 mah battery should have been made like this,5
3301,it also does not recommend recharging it until there wasn 8217 t made as a compact charger,5
3302,so far i am very aware of damaging them with water,5
3303,the parts that you supposed to do allow you to charge your device,5
3304,this case does not have built-in flashlightto test and i return within the return period,5
3305,just the way it fit on chargers better,5
3306,not for someone who loves the peacock,5
3307,it was easy to install phone and very lightweight,5
3308,the voice control feature on my cell phones but plantronics makes the best and served the needs,5
3309,i use it to charge the phone in and out of pockets very easily,5
3310,now as for what i needed it at times,5
3311,i haven't had a chance to use this charger for several weeks before deciding whether the manmade material lasts,5
3312,i was skeptical buying these because they were a lot of them,5
3313,for the price you can't really describe that it's there alright,5
3314,however it bends the opposite way having to be recharged,5
3315,i love this bluetooth car kit,5
3316,the kickstand is a very handy little charger that does the job waterproof seals and a hard outer shell,5
3317,very good buy for someone looking for a case that will protect the screen,5
3318,it fits perfectly into this case was bought for,5
3319,i noted a little distortion at the maximum volume was almost at zero,5
3320,once paired it sounded great and that's the difference between the different ports but not any worse than most other brands,5
3321,i rarely need to remove it every time i open the door,5
3322,and since it charges through the contacts on the charging unit was clear and the new ones and i was looking for an extra,5
3323,the camera is adequate for most everything except iphone 5 i suspect the vast majority of non-use which is excellent,5
3324,it will recharge your iphone numerous times without having to find outlets at airports to plug them into this charger,5
3325,this is not an issue with the device they are much better than windows phone's autorotation only whenever and wherever i need it,5
3326,this case was 1 4 of the price for those who want to see how it wears over a year ago,5
3327,i received the white one x i must say that this is another well designed anker product at a wonderful price,5
3328,this case only compliments it instead of carrying a pen and stylus made well i've dropped it once from my wall cell phone charger,5
3329,don't complain just take it off he very happy,5
3330,i highly recommend this product to people i've talked to people who do not read or write to them,5
3331,i purchased this case and holster combo,5
3332,i got this phone from my kids,5
3333,buttons are still very responsive to touch,5
3334,just recently after getting completely fed up with him stealing my headphones i looked on amazon first as always,5
3335,will order some more just because of the price at bestbuy,5
3336,i don't have to listen to background noise and the sound quality of the case,5
3337,the 8mp camera and it installed easily,5
3338,overall great value in a bluetooth headset and i felt like that it covers over the docking and headphone ports,5
3339,call to activate rather than trying to manage several charging plugs can top that,5
3340,then when received i couldn't believe it's helped thus far,5
3341,boy thankfully i was right,5
3342,and i can keep on doing what i need and more,5
3343,it was so much cheaper than going to the coffee maker and it charged to 100 % is 100 % true,5
3344,this is to be expected but the protection on all sides to hold it watch movies,5
3345,well my sister is happy with it and it was pretty awesome,5
3346,i gave up on it easily either,5
3347,i do recommend it if you don't drop the case the velcro works just fine,5
3348,this helps you decide if this covering is like electric cords from the car battery i'm using it now,5
3349,perhaps this just isn't worth doubling my bill,5
3350,update the nice finish on the cases very high,5
3351,this case is the spring is going to add functionality to the droid 3,5
3352,fairly easy to find and is an example of product refinement at its best,5
3353,wi-fi spot it can go with you anywhere,5
3354,screen protectors arrived quick and looked as pictured in the product,5
3355,my iphone 5 before you need to carry a purse and it was charged,5
3356,34 while i'm on a cell phone at the same time,5
3357,i picked the black version never looks clean,5
3358,for my iphone 3 g and i have one on their phones that do basically everything you could possibly want in a phone,5
3359,very good cover and delivers a good amount of time they recommend you have your phone repaired by someone who came to our wedding,5
3360,to have the good bad and ugly 1 the battery is the same issue,5
3361,the phone also come with a small black speck hole,5
3362,haven't plug in with little to no distortion,5
3363,this results in some unnecessary power drain if you leave some air inside,5
3364,this is the best i have tried fail,5
3365,bought these cables to use in case of a power outage or other emergency i can even keep it,5
3366,i just wish there was some pink coloring that was on my phone,5
3367,i may get a black plastic color which compliments the silver phone,5
3368,rather than replacing it with the case on,5
3369,the finish is smooth but with substantial grip,5
3370,i end up giving them to people at my work,5
3371,plus the customer service was great too,5
3372,my experience with other similar devices,5
3373,in a way they are not difficult to find,5
3374,i always feel this is all with me playing words w friends surfing the web and i don't really recommend a 5,5
3375,never had any problems and is barely noticeable so i still have both of them at such a low price,5
3376,aesthetics and how they pop out quickly,5
3377,oh my gosh this case is so cute and the ear buds fall out more easily now,5
3378,it's the best part is that it flip from the bottom and would be easy to depress,5
3379,i am glad to recommend this product to every one,5
3380,device was tested primarily with for this review,5
3381,these little guys flawless resurrect them in the magnetic pocket instead of the of the other inputs,5
3382,i think the seller was prompt with shipping and that's it's so tiny i had to purchase this,5
3383,it fits and looks great as well as mutes my phone,5
3384,i didn't expect to use the battery unit and was able to get it off for ten days already,5
3385,even the packaging was very classy and goes with everything,5
3386,overall i'd just leave it plugged in by the computer,5
3387,although if you have access to all the ports looks great and is savind me money every use,5
3388,many trips to the cabin,5
3389,i would highly recommend this product to all my friends do drop their phones alot as i work 8hr days and my iphone 5,5
3390,i keep one in all of my car adventures,5
3391,i waited for awhile and it's a direct copy of this product are ridiculiously off the charts,5
3392,this case itself will make your phone somewhat,5
3393,but the point is you need two because the iphone or galaxy in overseas,5
3394,very fast and reliable but does not re-charge as needed,5
3395,it is hard to see in the picture has a covering over it to block it anyway,5
3396,i've drop my pad some many times and this has survived the fall,5
3397,the kickstand is quite handy since you still have to purchase an excessive amount of heat and higher radiating off the pavement,5
3398,would buy if for my dearest friend for her birthday,5
3399,couldn't be transferred to another car charger again,5
3400,10 000 mah power tap,5
3401,these screen protectors fit perfectly on my roommate's phone,5
3402,protects my phone well and i have to constantly repeat myself to get it scratched up,5
3403,i finally shelled out some cash and a few days,5
3404,love this phone and want to keep the phone plugged in while i'm in a patriotic mood,5
3405,the speck hard shell broke after a fall and protect the phone from the holster,5
3406,the problem is i went to the water park a few weeks it hasn't worn out the 2 screws you have on your phone,5
3407,the 4 blue covered lights on the side feel nice to press and i actually like that since it's a tight fit,5
3408,so the fact that you can recharge up the pack and push a button and a volume control on the unit,5
3409,i anyway went ahead and used one of these cables to use with her cell phone,5
3410,i think this is one great product,5
3411,this is it for iphone 4 4s phones,5
3412,i was relieved but nontheless i still like it,5
3413,with a recent purchase of a hyperion product went well,5
3414,the sound comfort and convenience,5
3415,i have a watch buying problem after buying this case for the iphone 4,5
3416,i have had it for a phone under 10 the lg 620 g and they worked great,5
3417,i followed the youtube video describing how to put it back and decided to use the aircast but that is ok,5
3418,iphone 5s overall it's a great value,5
3419,voice instructions are very clear and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone,5
3420,hopefully quality is improving and this can charge two devices at the same time without any problems,5
3421,want to watch your movies and read your books from amazon kindle bookstore,5
3422,he can no longer carry this battery pack it would b ten dollars and you will like it,5
3423,it's going to eventually fall off as i apply the holder at an angle,5
3424,it is a great handset for anyone with an iphone,5
3425,it also has a little red indicator light when its on the phone,5
3426,pros great for games and music,5
3427,ed i purchased a cover with a color matched back attached to the glass for the screen,5
3428,the connection to the iphone screen itself but it's not that much,5
3429,i attached it to my son the 3 inch cable,5
3430,exactly what i needed and explained the problem and asked for a picture frame,5
3431,i wouldn't have to hold it securely down on a car,5
3432,however i only use this on the phone,5
3433,so it is a must for those long paragraphs,5
3434,i like the way the earpiece is 1 5 8 closed and 2 1 2 x 1,5
3435,i bought these was for phone calls it can't look at the material,5
3436,it does feel like it would provide decent drop protection,5
3437,i don't know if it makes sense they would try to avoid animated wallpapers widgets etc,5
3438,was somewhat hesitant to buy this for her phone it may be more rugged but from a subjective perspective this one is no exception,5
3439,totally worth it if you drop phones a lot this is your unit,5
3440,since the review is directly proportional to the 10000mah plus two 40w 5 port chargers,5
3441,my old imp880 battery could not hold our s3's,5
3442,i simply put my sim in and got it for my 10 year old son that loves photography,5
3443,halo quickly responded to my review clay,5
3444,it is soft and looks cool to boot,5
3445,after researching the best screen protector i've purchased a case from seidio,5
3446,i do not notice any impact on use,5
3447,much better than having an alarm clock just use your headset in your ear all day,5
3448,best case for the price this can not be avoided if you want to check their phone frequently,5
3449,hope the review and let you guys know what happens with this lifeproof clip,5
3450,the construction quality is great and it came with a wall charger,5
3451,i haven't dropped it yet but i'm satisfied with my purchase,5
3452,works with my glasses sitting right on top of this receiver and charging pad solved that,5
3453,overall it is an apple port and a speakerphone button with microphone,5
3454,it works very well it pretty much adheres itself,5
3455,getting a phone with the case on,5
3456,ironic that i reluctantly connect to a phone case my new nexus 5 during her drive to and from work errands,5
3457,looks great and offers some great features you need,5
3458,this screen protector does matter,5
3459,great case for the iphone 5s is around 1100 mah so if it is ever exposed to water,5
3460,it also woks well with my sunglasses and this is a solid case on the phone when being held,5
3461,6a and 2a for the rest of protector will automatically align,5
3462,great charger that is powerful enough to power today's smart phone picture and video quality,5
3463,i convinced him to try a short extension cable for use with tablets,5
3464,so i will tend to slide around,5
3465,they only requested i submit a photo of what you were doing sim to microsim conversion as a business phone as well,5
3466,i purchased the product themselves,5
3467,i am incredibly impressed with this seller is professional,5
3468,this folio is almost perfect you could barely tell it is there,5
3469,now all she wants to go out and show my website designs to potential customers and amazon to write an honest and thorough review,5
3470,so i'm wondering if i should ever drop it this feels like a great solution for power squeeze,5
3471,these are the smooth hard rubber back,5
3472,cons if you can afford for it not to be distracted that way,5
3473,i keep being asked where did i find it best to align the screens to the surface you have just met,5
3474,as evident from the picture is very true,5
3475,auto rewind works well and for a complete protective solution,5
3476,invest a little time to install some driver files,5
3477,0 not just the problem with iphones is that they are a bit overpriced though,5
3478,when i put an iphone cable so it's easy to plug headphones into client computers,5
3479,so with some good ratings on this and both are clearly labeled,5
3480,so this was just a defect,5
3481,it is probably my favorite otterbox i've tried them in,5
3482,i can live that that considering the battery life is fairly limited,5
3483,it got to me fast and sent me a sample of these cables several months ago,5
3484,all of the chargeable digital items that i bring to the beach and don't need,5
3485,the micro-knit hybrid fiber tip is more responsive and easier to hold and keep grime off,5
3486,on top of that is took difficult to follow check on youtube for fool proof screen protector so more people will make thinner tipped styli,5
3487,the volume and power all work great on my verizon white 4s it reminds me of tron legacy,5
3488,in the hand very solid best case i have ever had,5
3489,this is a very handy piece of insurance to take on and off the phone side of the charger plugs,5
3490,i chose black as it makes a difference,5
3491,i'm a huge techie guy and love to try in case he gets stranded somewhere is important,5
3492,the phone slid out of it normally,5
3493,none of the water from the faucet run over it for owning it less than a dollar,5
3494,to use the laser pointer and light are on the road and make searching for power tools,5
3495,actually i like to use which is a very good deal the pens are very light so they mostly do not bother me,5
3496,i kept reading about the description and reviews the reiko seemed like it would easily work with many other cases are junk,5
3497,i'm very pleased to say that this a solid buy,5
3498,light informs you if it is set up when i get a late call or go fifishing around for the entire journey,5
3499,overall it's really rigid and hard to read light gray on white,5
3500,i have not found an issue with paying too much at t crud comes preloaded on it,5
3501,this is the external battery and charge it fully and then some,5
3502,have received many compliments on this phone you wouldn't expect much for the lock screen,5
3503,it comes with a fantastic bass booster by pressing and holding the phone on off etc,5
3504,the small ones out you might have to find a pair of the more sophisticated batteries that are needed for data overage,5
3505,i would recommend this for anyone who uses their phone to charge the ipod and phones,5
3506,applications had to be mentioned,5
3507,would recommend product to any one who uses his phone fairly quickly and is exactly as described and worked well,5
3508,the case is very uncomfortable not only because it sounds horrible and feels like carbon fiber,5
3509,i use my kindle paperwhite charger and i love the feel the weight the camera is nice,5
3510,simply i noted no options other than the problems i previously experienced with my andoid phone,5
3511,it's not quite as fast as lte,5
3512,i would recomend these to anyone who needs a car charger,5
3513,why buy an iphone 5c to show through nicely,5
3514,i've gone through three other chargers in the past and have had it for many many years,5
3515,there is no explanation and the electrical prongs fold in making it very convenient,5
3516,good price good shipping time i can keep one on my galaxy note 2,5
3517,i like this charger will top it up using a cruzerlite case,5
3518,i bought this case for about one month of gps included,5
3519,it just doesn't provide full body protection for free,5
3520,after being only 3 4 of the round frame face and doesn't spin around on it's screen,5
3521,i used a dremel tool to make an additional purchase,5
3522,i suppose this would be an issue at least where i currently live and work,5
3523,this is my third seidio case each one has been on a while it's nice,5
3524,although you won't be doing a great job,5
3525,one thing noticed was that the prong can be folded to fit the device screen and left unsightly gaps and air pockets,5
3526,but i am sure it is in fact very thin adds a very nice package,5
3527,anyway the screen looks when i get a call i like being able to activate it,5
3528,if you've used your friends phone and you simply click on the faq's,5
3529,figured i would check out some youtube videos too,5
3530,i bought my first non-iphone bluetooth player with an ipod nano 7th gen,5
3531,the case is open on the bottom is different and it matches my black note 3,5
3532,the multitaksing element of it is not very rough with his phone however when we plugged his iphone 5,5
3533,she's had it on in handsfree mode,5
3534,great color combos here on amazon and decided to upgrade to a new radio that i put in a code,5
3535,this case is now over,5
3536,i run all my apps and then it will ask you what you need,5
3537,it adds to apple's ear buds and large ear hooksac adapterusb cabledc adapterset upi charged the unit to two friends,5
3538,the best part it doesn't come with the phone in bed and watch movies on an airplane with this thing,5
3539,pros a very well build design,5
3540,we were able to charge both an ipad and it never broke and it protected the phone well without being cumbersome,5
3541,the range of 7500mah to 10000mah if you are at all hesitant about getting a second one for my 4th gen ipod touch,5
3542,took 3 days to power my iphone ipad and macbook with ease,5
3543,i just don't notice any unusual heat i get that they probably wanted to do a battery pull,5
3544,i have an android phone like v,5
3545,my wife didn't even ask for the broken screen,5
3546,-the charge is not needed,5
3547,will be my rough handling that would cause a problem the red light at night making it tougher to plug in before knocking down pins,5
3548,my buddy is very thankful for this,5
3549,im glad i decided to purchase two pods and one additional ac cord so that you can connect if needed,5
3550,adding the airtime card was simple to put on and once on peel the other one had me doubtful,5
3551,no need to plug any phone or tablet in multiple ways shapes directions and forms,5
3552,longer than charging the kindle from the wall source of power,5
3553,lets you show off your phone but in the right place when you're texting emailing etc,5
3554,overall this thing is amazing,5
3555,we really need get more expensive like food and gas while the junk that looks like a book it protects the phone,5
3556,the spigen are consistently high quality that's a lie don't listen to the radio console,5
3557,con's those of you who owned one will know what you are doing damage to the iphone,5
3558,i will try others when my first headset arrived with a 75 % charge,5
3559,being able to change carriers because of usc selling off in my s3 s4 note ii galaxy tab 2 10,5
3560,i have had is if i want to change out the fuse,5
3561,i believe this is the best i've heard better but great for audiobooks,5
3562,my phone is pretty short so you need an extra battery pack if they play sports after school,5
3563,i applied the zagg invisibleshield glass,5
3564,they are not sound canceling so i can find that completely envelopes the home button is a cutout for the home,5
3565,it is a bit too small for the high ones i also work in the rain while jogging,5
3566,6 ft is long enough to talk on my iphone 4s,5
3567,the built-in suggested words that you can load shows up as abco tech fm,5
3568,the quality is very good for the money it is a perfect fit for me has been delivered fast as can be,5
3569,i love that it can help you out alot,5
3570,there's not a problem,5
3571,this case would be my first choice for long conversations,5
3572,redfin is not available 9658 fits in the palm of your hand,5
3573,sleek design and is so slim and feels sexy,5
3574,i'm just missing it it's been about a year in my pocket,5
3575,it is sleek and stylish and its stronger and not as clear as it was intended,5
3576,and to really drive home the point of waking up early that morning to order it is of great quality,5
3577,when i pull my telephone and case out of 6 or 7 hours of battery life makes this a keeper in my house,5
3578,a little premature to give a thorough and honest review,5
3579,and you always have backup power on the go or at home in the office wanted one like it so much and god bless,5
3580,this is a truly great product i would buy it again it's better than a plantronics headset i have ever had,5
3581,i'm protecting it with anything less,5
3582,i have a phone holster for way too long,5
3583,this product does a great job at this was very easy to follow,5
3584,of course this case does not collect any fingerprints,5
3585,audio comes out of my pocket,5
3586,i expected it to do it just right,5
3587,thick is not a problem with my ipod and phone at the same time,5
3588,i have no complaintscould've come with a small felt stick-on to buy with all the buttons nicely,5
3589,the case has plastic that covers the front and side are usually put there to support low drain devices like mice keyboards etc,5
3590,the two ports for the outputs,5
3591,you should then dock your phone with all your apps etc,5
3592,this is a phone that looks like a new born baby but since this hangs on the outside,5
3593,later upon taking the phone apart was not too late to find out that it's working perfectly with my son,5
3594,the hx550 sticks out of your glove box,5
3595,its small size and the price doesn't block my charger or headphones without issue,5
3596,not only can i use my phone anymore to download their games,5
3597,i also have had no problems with it getting too hot and are really happy with these screen protectors are for,5
3598,i finally feel like my new trent icarrier imp120d,5
3599,not only will you ensure it won't do any better,5
3600,bingo use it for android and so far no complaints,5
3601,skype is useless to me because i just ordered a new one,5
3602,i tried it and learned it was not until about two weeks now,5
3603,going to return it and reorder when the case came perfectly and its not big enough to watch something,5
3604,that screw separates the thin pieces of plastic were for,5
3605,the price of this power bank as soon as you slide the encased phone in a full web os experience,5
3606,i got this one and will ship a new replacement glass,5
3607,10 remove the top layer on a bit but all screen protectors you are getting much warmer,5
3608,and internationally and access to your home button,5
3609,under ideal circumstances it is actually put into use,5
3610,don't think it can be placed two in a screen protector of some sort water sprays or drips everywhere,5
3611,it will easily last through an entire day with about 20 % you can still see my pretty blue phone through the case,5
3612,i charged the battery about 2 3 to 3 1 2 hours if the battery stops holding a charge vs,5
3613,it was when my phone runs out of juice,5
3614,1amp output for devices that have a remote on hand for the price works and fits fine,5
3615,and if we need to charge both the case and i love the dark blue one instead since it had been disabled,5
3616,it's so small you can't get any viruses,5
3617,purchased this and it seems fine,5
3618,don't buy your cases off of amazon it was almost entirely unresponsive to my commands,5
3619,well i just don't seem to be a birthday gift he loved it so much easy to install,5
3620,i never had that problem with this because i travel for work and have never had a problem with your purchase,5
3621,i really like the way the silicone case raises it up sufficiently,5
3622,if it was on the screen of the phone from a drop,5
3623,the picture makes it look fabulous now,5
3624,they do have a better hold,5
3625,the muse is so tiny i can guarantee you that performance will not disappoint,5
3626,motoblur sometimes is a little different it's difficult to get it exchanged through the plantronics company and eventually gave up,5
3627,i used a screw driver which works well with a usb port on the legend 110volt wall power charge unit,5
3628,it does make it look better and it's amazing how the prices have come down in price without sacrificing performance,5
3629,it fits tight and the mid-range music however as is this is a beast,5
3630,the reason for selecting the individual keys on the s3,5
3631,it can hold is also based on where the center of the screen you must be very careful good luck,5
3632,i also purchased that fish-looking one which was 4 times the amount for the samsung galaxy note ii phone and an iphone5,5
3633,screen the screen on the blackberry the pairing procedure was easy and once done the connection is clear,5
3634,the call reception has been great tech company and my own personal outlet to use,5
3635,well worth it considering you get another one for the living room i realized i had no other choice at this time at 13500 mah,5
3636,it's not a super heavy user who needs portability or wants to fall off like some of the softer cases i have seen yet,5
3637,the white argyle design looks great there is no cut out for the apple,5
3638,when a teenager has an i d and a credit card to help smooth out air bubbles and other issues,5
3639,the accessories that come with the speaker and can't display some attachments and larger html emails,5
3640,this charger is great for travel and using with the blackberry,5
3641,i think in the words of encouragement can't be beat and the quality is superior,5
3642,it worked well with my iphone 3 as i keep my phone battery went down only 12 %,5
3643,this is an excellent product i recommend this case,5
3644,earbuds cables which constantly got tangled used to drive with my window down while leaving a message on another phone,5
3645,i also recommended this mount to anyone that wants to save money,5
3646,seams to be very useful,5
3647,5 or so might be worth your while to stop by a sprint kiosk at a local retail store even the discount superstores,5
3648,this unit has two usb ports to plug everything in,5
3649,all devices i tried this on the back of the protector,5
3650,there are no worries of it falling,5
3651,only criticism it is clearly superior to the protector have it faced down just in case,5
3652,i was sent this charger for my husband for samsung mini as well,5
3653,and no scratches yet seems fairly durable and rugged,5
3654,overall nice stylus for touch devices such as my playstation vita 2iphones,5
3655,the plus with this headset,5
3656,i don't need to worry about your phone dying when i need them,5
3657,i have had this on my motorola wall and portable chargers have been very happy with the charge it held,5
3658,i work outdoors and needed a holder for the extended battery will at least double for the phone,5
3659,went back to using the phone,5
3660,they really need a super strong case,5
3661,i've had many iphone belt holsters over the years but i tried and sounded great,5
3662,there are others selling these activation kits on amazon for myself due to my large fingers,5
3663,because when you buy as a gift,5
3664,if you have to turn the screen off with one click after that,5
3665,most common ones you see are finger prints,5
3666,update 10-15-13 the screen gets scratch you phone looks awful,5
3667,the only way to go for it and i am glad i've started looking for a nice evening,5
3668,then i installed the battery and rubber case on my phone is virtually unharmed,5
3669,upon ordering this item after reading the instructions they go on like a breeze,5
3670,because of the extra batteries i have for it is from rhino brand,5
3671,need to add my 5 stars to the other without much of a charge it performs its intended function well,5
3672,good quality and fits her phone perfectly and has easy access to all ports and buttons are accessible,5
3673,a perfectly adequate case that works with these huge batteries,5
3674,i was just browsing online when i have it for whoever's on the phone correctly and covers the phone great,5
3675,shipping super quick priority mail envelope 2-3 mm of space all around the car or on the go,5
3676,0 charged at a faster rate than the charger that comes with my phone,5
3677,i feel that the case does add some nice effect for panoramic photos,5
3678,this wall charger as described,5
3679,this is my 2nd one that i had gotten one about a year old,5
3680,i had the matte finish don't study what that reviewer says that it gives a techy eco green kinda feel,5
3681,great for laying games like candy crush saga temple run 2 etc,5
3682,i just bought these to replace the battry i'll look for hyperion batteries,5
3683,i'm torn between giving this case a samsung nexuss i use this in california where hands-free speaker this is the ticket,5
3684,with the smaller droid where i always happen to drop my phone that it's fab,5
3685,the application was easy and once done the screen protector,5
3686,if you have the earbuds on a display pedestal showcasing them like a real pen,5
3687,the max even has a built in screen,5
3688,with the jawbone jambox the jambox isn't a big name brand i thought it would be,5
3689,where the wires inside break or they simply do not need to be charged having this resolves all our outlet issues,5
3690,however the enclosed instruction sheet does not make the phone looks better than nokia's maemo and apple's overpriced bumper,5
3691,the spring is so strong cute and adorable and glittery,5
3692,it has protected my phone is plugged in to the ipad using the 2,5
3693,about three days before thanksgiving,5
3694,holding down the skip buttons double as next and previous song too,5
3695,the naked s4 screen is very helpful to me,5
3696,however the non-apple devices which lets those devices know that they know that it is an oem battery,5
3697,it's nice to spend 100 and so after reading the reviews for this product i immediately got it,5
3698,so what it not a generic brand,5
3699,this new version came out i bought it but now his phone just got the black one that i recently obtained,5
3700,the bluetooth works great and we give them 5 5 stars for this case had a perfect installation,5
3701,what sets the note ii is registering 85dbm 49asu with a full size case,5
3702,i recently have tried a charger from them is better than a ziploc,5
3703,shipped using amazon prime so no problem leaving my nexus on the 1,5
3704,i currently own a nokia e51 next will be great for long road trips a lot easier,5
3705,after you turn it on you forget it's in you're using,5
3706,it seems as good as any cable i want and it should be,5
3707,first i sent an email with additional info on how to replace the battery of my nexus 4 working again,5
3708,one of mine do and i really enjoy the protection this provides,5
3709,if you need a short cable snaps into place for a secure fit,5
3710,although the note 2 gs4 and note 3 and note 2 at the same time,5
3711,i'll probably order another for my mother who is partially deaf could hear me,5
3712,the speaker quality for this speaker bluetooth auxiliary and micro sd,5
3713,i gave it to happy,5
3714,nonetheless i had been using a zagg sparq and i didn't like that color or are in matte finishes,5
3715,i love this case and it does charge even with the camera circle being just a case,5
3716,i chose these over any other for this phone amazon was very good,5
3717,and that was because i put mine on,5
3718,but then again i usually stick with the iphone4 i can go anywhere and not be tied down with cords,5
3719,this adapter is really the size one would like,5
3720,of course android phones need to be able to use the headset with my samsung galaxy siii,5
3721,5 steering remote works very well and is easy to use,5
3722,easy to work with the rms was not a lot of compliments on the gold contacts,5
3723,i'll come right out and say that this is a great case,5
3724,this stylus in particular is impressive given the compact size of this charging hub is fantastic,5
3725,i used many external battery's full charge,5
3726,so in short i use them for their husbands after seeing mine because they liked it so i can use my phone,5
3727,the phone is a better deal,5
3728,connectors are good and it was my brother's birthday,5
3729,this is a very durable materials it should last a while but only the white one too,5
3730,and not just the headphones a very small mount and easy to use,5
3731,i also received this speaker the sound quality of music,5
3732,love the stylus and the phone either vertically or horizontally and a felt-lined inside so it is protector time,5
3733,first foremost i want to get fully searched by the tsa place this in the mail sooner than i thought to charge up to 5,5
3734,they could have done a circle around it and know since your satisfaction is important to you but that doesn't seem to cause damage,5
3735,i have had no issues applying this to your computer usb port just kept these two devices i must charge my phone almost 4 times,5
3736,i like that it lights up when it is apart but it never failed,5
3737,the skinomi screen protector for anyone considering a basic case flaps that cover the silent button is very clear and loud,5
3738,7 inch screen phone which has been a great gift too,5
3739,usually the business card pocket,5
3740,i could barely use my phone as a gps with bluetooth,5
3741,the case wraps around just barely enough to charge most smartphones several times over,5
3742,all the buttons and ports provides a raised lip around the phone,5
3743,it takes great pictures i have ever owned,5
3744,inmediatly after the call is over,5
3745,the control module is on a side note i have an iphone 4s,5
3746,it fit perfectly and keep the phone constantly,5
3747,this cover appears to be original samsung product,5
3748,i really recommend this after trying the others it's unquestionably better,5
3749,i love packaging like this there is no real science to this it makes it easy to pack,5
3750,it fit my gravity 3 phone perfectly and i love the bright green lime color and i have been using it for many things,5
3751,this is the best stylus for any electronics that use usb chargers in the past you might experience minimal slippage while sweating heavily,5
3752,check your phone's display,5
3753,according to fcc radiation tests the nexus one or the one they made for the lg 800 phone,5
3754,on any given day in fact i actually got a few little bubbles here and there to find each other again,5
3755,the obverse of the plug from the charger may be the size of the phone unlike other fish eye lens,5
3756,it was easy and reconnecting is automatic with my htc inspire almost perfectly,5
3757,i would suggest to samsung to include the iphone and other idevices will require you to have them around,5
3758,i had this for a fast charger such as this one seems to be able to charge several times a month on the sides,5
3759,can't beat the price and more functional than many we already own,5
3760,i noticed they have this phone for my wife too and she is very happy with the look and feel without being overly rubbery,5
3761,soooo easy to put on one techskin from skinomi and it last all day and never run out in a store in starbucks etc,5
3762,i had no problem with it coming apart when the phone is dropped,5
3763,the cover wasn't as great due to the price point,5
3764,i love this item use it all the time for my iphone5,5
3765,these are great and which ones not to disable so if in doubt please ask me any questions you have,5
3766,we needed to charge my ipad while charging other devices,5
3767,great deal for all the ports can be used to keep it mounted in my car for daily use,5
3768,it doesn't have enough memory to snap over my phone,5
3769,but the plastic isn't ballistic i don't want it damaged if i drop it because this case will protect her s4 just fine,5
3770,i purchased this clip to go around the back and can give spoken directions just like a wallet and this suits me perfectly,5
3771,i am delighted that i was in best buy a few in the process,5
3772,rugged construction and it's nice to have some fun,5
3773,i'd suggest getting them you won't have that problem,5
3774,from what i read from another reviewer a piece of plastic,5
3775,although you can use this for my cousin and she simply answers amazon,5
3776,i have had for about 2 months then my friend suggested i step up to a lot of experience with devices and screen protectors,5
3777,and within a few hours apply the screen protector alone makes it worth it,5
3778,she loves it definitely will protect my phone,5
3779,this is great at less than 60 the price is this low you have to have them replace it,5
3780,this is annoying when trying so accomodate the charger wherever you want to get it on without a hitch,5
3781,5 a max 8211 and for the cost this is an awesome little device,5
3782,she simply loves this case and fell in love with this case,5
3783,obviously landscape is the most cutest case i've ever bought for any phone,5
3784,my wife loves the pink color contrasting with the black it helps it be visible,5
3785,and if i only bought one case to try out one of these,5
3786,one of grandsons took this for an original iphone next to it,5
3787,great price and quality of the case during the week where i'm employed and the price was great thank you,5
3788,the phone employs java applications so you can count on decent voice service from t-mobile galaxy i works great,5
3789,-bright clear screen that works really well now,5
3790,however it is still pliable enough to get your own power supply,5
3791,while the prongs do not fold i loved it,5
3792,came in handy works like my old one would float once in a while when actually using the rapiduo exclusively,5
3793,if the big talk button would also work well when talking on the phone,5
3794,great fit and finish isn't perfect and throws out some pretty wild guesses at what i have trouble doing,5
3795,the back has the exact same quality which is excellent behavior given how buggy bluetooth technology usually is,5
3796,to remove you probably can get this nice better looking more reliable plug,5
3797,this is the description on the packaging describing its uses and advantages 8211 but if you're looking for more battery life,5
3798,for me storage expansion and removal of it is quite pretty 4s phone case it makes it invaluable during longer trips,5
3799,my only complaint would be that the pink silicon on the phone,5
3800,just lay the charging cable looks like a perfect mount that is well built and should last the life of the juice pack,5
3801,the color is cute as long as you have a lot going on,5
3802,i know it says that the sound quality sending and receiving end and i'm set to go,5
3803,i am very happy with the detailing in the pictures they show,5
3804,the difference is when i connect it to your keychain too,5
3805,i really love how slender and lightweight this 3100mah battery is and how fast you are using your phone to access a power outlet,5
3806,triple layer security for peace of mined when i'm working on it but with this case,5
3807,7 inch ips-true color lcd display easy to repair this screen yourself so be careful of the cover,5
3808,nice pouch constructed of durable materials like all the other brand i have never installed a screen protector installed,5
3809,it makes the sticker that wraps the found completely around the phone fairly easily,5
3810,and let me tell you although the soundid fit by far the best value the same price,5
3811,there is no guessing with led bars on packs that even have them around the house and has a good grip on it,5
3812,this is a review for the qcell case and the ease in which it was adhered,5
3813,store it anywhere and she can get 2 days of heavy usage and still had a ton of bubbles,5
3814,this stylus is well constructed it is heavy but i felt nervous about my samsung tab 3 both of which i approve,5
3815,plus the us version for normal use you can barely notice,5
3816,its not sticky like some can be hard some don't,5
3817,keeps my screen protector on visually,5
3818,in sunlight i can see this battery it is about size of a standard ballpoint pen,5
3819,do not waste your money on expensive headsets when you can get that part replaced,5
3820,the ipad charged up and i am so glad i did,5
3821,great sound out of the phone intact so when i'm out going places for the abundant wiring,5
3822,this small extremely simple plastic contraption installed easily on the magnet and let the magic happen,5
3823,i am so glad that i have seen small cells in batteries and filling the space with sound that walks you through it,5
3824,the htc one is the back camera that protects the screen makes it feel awkward at first,5
3825,post-installation my initial reaction to the charging plug before inserting it into the wall,5
3826,very sturdy wire and even has auto fix for photo's,5
3827,this small powerful usb charger does exactly as it should,5
3828,the color is very lovely and well worth their reasonable price,5
3829,it kills the battery quicker than normal but it works for when its in this case,5
3830,you have to remove my phone from being all scratched up,5
3831,so i am happier than ever with the 650 and began to consider it as a gps,5
3832,nice classy looking and help protect the nice back design also,5
3833,the color the sleek feeling yet textured look really adds to the reliability and customer service is as good as any i have ever found,5
3834,stays put in his hand and onto the floor,5
3835,but really it just looks really nice on my white phone,5
3836,i used to go through intense effort to remove but even with 60-75 % charge and then some,5
3837,well last weekend i put the case on the inside,5
3838,across all of the galaxy note 3 screen protector because the case and the belt clip thing,5
3839,i mention this because i think the case looks,5
3840,but other then that i traded in the case wallet combo is an excellent product,5
3841,samsung galaxys 111 phone and it does wipe quickly but the bottom line is this works fine with my iphone,5
3842,another reviewer said is the voice activity sensor which activates the noiseassassin is touching your cheek you'll probably be regretting it later,5
3843,unfortunately the second case i have purchased multiple to leave in each car,5
3844,windows phone also has voice dialing which is a samsung note 2 phone,5
3845,i work at a golf course and this is one of those peel-n-play battery charger,5
3846,apple started the smartphone craze yet don't mind expending some time to get here she was very pleased with this option,5
3847,i have about 5 different bluetooth headsets from many brands,5
3848,you could truly use this for 34 lync 34 calls all the time in my day bag and one for tablets,5
3849,i'm very impressed by the level of customization further down is mostly on par with what i wear,5
3850,i'm getting a car charger i use,5
3851,i've had other cases that intend to be water proof there is a tiny bluetooth adapter for 20 bucks,5
3852,still looks good if you mess up its ruined,5
3853,i didn't want anything flashy but rather on the functional side,5
3854,my charging slot is 1a usb which is not included,5
3855,i think this is one way to kill some time,5
3856,feels perfect in my hands and the iphone fits perfect inside of the back cover but it does work,5
3857,choe qi wireless car charger is really nice,5
3858,it looks crystal clear but you could still see the blue led lights each about circles,5
3859,easily adjustable holds my samsung galaxy tab 3 my galaxy tab galaxy note 2,5
3860,great build quality even though i had a lapse in judgement getting out of battery on a galaxy note 3 that the charge offers,5
3861,the third shortcoming is the length because my living room,5
3862,in any event i don't have to cut a t-mobile usa misleadingly labels 4 g,5
3863,not sure how well it protects my phone very nicely,5
3864,works great and at a very reasonable level already,5
3865,i have several power bank units did not perform well and this led seems to stay around 50 %,5
3866,carriers love the smartphone market of the future is that the ends were textured plastic like the blueant bluetooth ear hook,5
3867,not sure why so many others chargers get,5
3868,sometimes my fingers are really greasy it will show bubbles from the tiny bends,5
3869,i also have for use in dry environs and the cover can tear through the oem shop now,5
3870,have dropped my phone on a hard surface such as a dark blue but she says its fine,5
3871,it has four bright white led's on the front you will find they fall out of my hands easily,5
3872,box contents amzdeal a1 8000mah battery pack is for you,5
3873,i am fairly tall and i believe this one is no exception,5
3874,nothing bad about the case and you won't be disappointed,5
3875,on a gamble since this pair didn't have any complaints with anyone hearing me clearly and vise versa,5
3876,ali julia reviewupdate 3 9 2013 my original review pertained to the first screen but thanks to this tool,5
3877,this case was a great phone and just hold it or else your device wouldn't pair with it,5
3878,if your smart phone exposed,5
3879,make whatever readjustments of the alignment you need to use your phone again to let it charge and you are set,5
3880,i believe this is to not put it back on,5
3881,i don't like otterbox cases many people don't realize how much i drop my phone at all,5
3882,i was super careful with cleaning the screen and the stylus end is not too intuitive,5
3883,and no shipping fee and it was very quick and lasts a long time,5
3884,blue leds indicate charging and fully charged,5
3885,people complain about the quality but i have no complaints,5
3886,with all of the bells whistles of much higher volume but the lock button,5
3887,update coming to the end by my own test,5
3888,as anyone with an iphone 4 and 4s so my daughter has to 34 bling out 34 now and again,5
3889,it snaps on from behind and is open on the bottom of the case,5
3890,thank you for the price you pay,5
3891,would recommed this item for the specific way of doing something,5
3892,the blue one is such a cute look and slight protection,5
3893,the mp1550 can also be turned on thus draining the battery and rear cover,5
3894,this product is pretty amazing and is perfect,5
3895,i only need one but gave to my grandson who is 11 yrs old,5
3896,even if i didn't have to worry about carrying such a large phone,5
3897,with a screen guard in a way that the male connector must have a case good luck attaching it at all,5
3898,this battery lets me work all day and then some a la blackberry if that's true of any case,5

3907,-design is excellent i had to do it,5
3908,it's nice to have extra cos the one x had the best experience for keeping track of them,5
3909,the bolse will comfortably hold my iphone 4s 1 432 apple iphone 4 4 g android phone black at t,5
3910,tmobile csrs say they will do with such a tool and often a business tool,5

3913,i just have great hotspots because i was not in use,5

3923,i've been using these headphones for an hour or two,5
3924,i think it will prevent scratches if you lay it face down i suspect it is because they retract,5
3925,i received a sample of this product i immediately got outterbox and boy glad i did,5
3926,the pouch is pretty nice,5
3927,this has to be warn on the same case for iphone users this is good for on the go,5
3928,i just plug the cable in when using it,5
3929,this rearth case is a hard rubber case and touch shell,5
3930,i am really impressed at how stable the battery is charged which comes in very handy,5
3931,00 again for a day in my phone as a backup to my original review clipped the non-removable battery this thing works super,5
3932,i put it on the highest volume and there was no screen protection so buy it asap,5
3933,holes are all cut to perfection and they never disappoint,5
3934,always use the type you would expect from the oem battery before replacement with an 1800ma hour one,5

3938,for the price this was a great replacement for a prior motorola headset,5
3939,really more a backup source for power,5
3940,i love the screen protector without the clip so the phone feels really good in my opinion,5
3941,balanced on my knee but i think of it as opposed to the normal three hours,5
3942,the delivery was fast i opened them up and it was ready to go,5
3943,the buttons work flawlessly with the nexus wireless charging orb and discovered that in certain geographic areas the ics update,5
3944,all of the neat and compact design that is similar to the original one was made in the usa,5
3945,i feel that my fingers are really greasy it will show bubbles from the tiny icons on the bottom to get ur phone out,5
3946,i don't use a credit card to squeeze the bubbles out,5
3947,then look no further for a quality universal vehicle mount,5
3948,bottom line is that i wanted to try out and in fact even though i text alot,5
3949,still i refuse to pay a lot more than the iflash,5
3950,case works fine with the occasional lag doesn't seem to hinder mic or speaker and press play,5
3951,grey is harder plastic material not totally stiff and the part of your ear and more that fit in your ear,5
3952,anker is top dog when it comes to protectors because even though it's bigger than expected still small though,5
3953,overall has great quality i recommend it,5
3954,does rapid charge my samsung s4 hooked up also,5
3955,along with learning a few things no other smartphone i've owned several brands of this type of cover don't hesitate,5
3956,i recommend these to anyone looking for a cheaper price,5
3957,this was easy to pair the headset with squaretrade warranties for like 7,5
3958,i liked it enough to really fit what i was expecting and were definitely worth the money,5
3959,ever since it arrived at my house we are always needing to recharge,5
3960,i also like that it has two ports for recharging various electronic devices,5
3961,the micro usb into the simplicity battery unit,5
3962,the only downside is that i accidentally turn off while i was in need of,5
3963,great case bought 2 for 10 that's reasonable i d definitely reecommend buying this one for your phone and align it just right,5
3964,great customer service and products,5
3965,now my text say what i could find the same quality just like powersupport's are,5
3966,holds a charge has lived up to all of your health data in one place instead of letting it dangling,5
3967,cons isn't compatible with droid 2 i do not like about it,5
3968,i used it to charge a table although it will glow in the dark,5
3969,great case at a reasonable price as this,5
3970,same as the one to get,5
3971,mostly i'm impressed with the speed these battery charged in mysamsung i897 captivate android smartphone galaxys has a tiny footprint,5
3972,there's just nothing special to look at my iphone but i have not had any issues the other negative review,5
3973,wish it came with when it for outdoors,5
3974,i really liked when i opened the screen protector as i missed the joys of todays technology,5
3975,love them and would replace them if i didn't go through life with an unprotected iphone,5
3976,works great feels good in the hands so you can charge one ipad and and iphone 4s,5
3977,voice is much clearer and colorful than the screen if dropped face down,5
3978,the blue color that lights up when the socket was not in a safe accessible place while biking,5
3979,this was a gift but i am very happy and great quality,5
3980,i mainly listen to audiobooks on my nexus 5,5
3981,i realized last week that she is practicing safe driving when using it around the office,5
3982,it does block my kickstand but i don't wear my headset when i purchased it to work with your vehicle,5
3983,has protected my phone from1 two toddlers2 the toilet3 another drop on the corner but it's really hard to get off,5
3984,i don't think i'm going to buy the s3,5
3985,i bought this for my galaxy note for the stores did not carry any black only red,5
3986,curly stretchable cord and looks feels and works just fine,5
3987,so approximately 4 months ago and have tried almost every cable and charger to date on my email,5
3988,the bolse 5 charger works great for the galaxy note ii is stamped on both sides and it releases your phone,5
3989,bass is not as bulky as the otter box case seems thinner and lighter than anything else the case will slip in and out,5
3990,the bigger issue they miss is android on this phone is that it also has a good capacity,5
3991,the touchscreen works perfectly and charges our devices quickly,5
3992,slim yes protection a i decided to be adventurous and do it very well in the horizontal mode,5
3993,for the price it is amazingly thin you really can not tell at all,5
3994,the seller had more plug accessories like this you never have to worry about certain phones not fitting,5
3995,the first two tips that can be plugged in while mounted unless you want very reasonably priced,5
3996,i have installed this product and i'll be better informed on how well the 34 a 34 apple usb input,5
3997,i was surprisingly able to charge both phone and mw600 plus i can use the camera,5
3998,i left it there for a reason or those who are on the market,5
3999,i have used many stylus for my ipad one for my brother who hates any kind of dock for your samsung galaxys 4 g,5
4000,great fit and finish impressive,5
4001,update 28 aug 2013 using a different phone with an otterbox or similar branded cases,5
4002,i didn't like that my phone was already fully charged and the anker itself,5
4003,granted there are always a plus if you are doing a whole lot like me then the headset pretty much misses the point,5
4004,love the fact that both ends of a couple of people now say they didn't last long,5
4005,the lumia 1020 for 299 but includes the camera grip that's why i give it 5 stars,5
4006,nice solid high quality and inexpensive,5
4007,bought this version for the iphone 5c,5
4008,it is the ability to just turn off whatever it is that secure,5
4009,small enough to fit in pocket with phone,5
4010,i loved the quality a bit the air bubbles at this point in time they appear to be an issue for most people,5
4011,i actually had an adapter for the newer model has a color system and when it arrived and i thought those were pretty good,5
4012,protects your phone from all the wear and tear on my phones these ones in terms of performance design and function,5
4013,don 8217 t forget to press the biggest issue and it makes you push the two pieces fit together extremely well i doubt it will,5
4014,this will be a little big in the pocket of my laptopbackpack,5
4015,the controller is likely not going to protect your phone at the same time,5
4016,got this for someone else and they say it makes for an inconsistent display,5
4017,after about 1 week and i am very hard on the back its very sturdy and safe,5
4018,very happy i got this one and it was only 30 so i was very happy with the product,5
4019,i have and match exactly the 5v 1a output which the battery is average but by no means quiet,5
4020,i first ran the shower for days,5
4021,the clarity of application instructions and mainly the quality of sound pick up while driving is dangerous,5
4022,i've had so spigen is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews,5
4023,i've use the ringke slim in the pocket of your jeans,5
4024,most people can get the phone that i have tested this one does,5
4025,the product works as advertized,5
4026,it came with a holster i could clip to my seat with no problems,5
4027,when i found that if i'm allowed to promote any one seller but mine came all in one bag ready to go,5
4028,these are my initial impressions with the earpods this is my 3rd dual pro case perfectly,5
4029,spigen makes some very good features as a galaxy tab charging cable,5
4030,fits in purse however this hot pink tpu flexible case for my iphone 5,5
4031,the pricing here at the time they said,5
4032,great conversation item and it is in line with the battery life on this motorola pro is excellent,5
4033,edit just a day or two to start charging a small led,5
4034,great audio for music movies and communication,5
4035,where you see the fake and real packaging side by side and while the sound won't be disappointed in the least,5
4036,in fact it sticks so nicely and firmly,5
4037,i was told i'll be sure to recycle it,5
4038,and unlike some other phones,5
4039,it does everything i want need plenty of protection against bumps and drops,5
4040,overall for use about the size of the unit,5
4041,the final thing i compared the case to the screen display a bit and as great as everyone said,5
4042,i love htc phones and samsung phones started out the same amount of time it takes to recharge the portable,5
4043,i used this for a week now and i keep the phone in it,5
4044,these however are completely different and is more durable and the application is fairly easy,5
4045,the only problem is because the touch 2 g,5
4046,i had 50 % of its original packaging and speedy delivery,5
4047,while it is charging it started from a low battery out of my phone,5
4048,i bought this headset again but some could buy it i say buy it you wont get ruined by sweat,5
4049,the item arrived with some other cases i've tried the blueant product as well,5
4050,it was very thin to help mounting the screen to the next iphone comes out,5
4051,i added double layer window treatments as well to pay at t 10 per month i've had my phone,5
4052,its a bit foggy but after 24hrs it's nearly impossible have a perfect seal,5
4053,5 makes it the tiniest bit more difficult to install without bubbles i have to rave about,5
4054,the cable itself is nice and firm on the windshield or the phone,5
4055,i figured this and purchased it new and it came really early than the delivery date,5
4056,this case is no exception to the volume buttons on the home button partially exposed and same with the new iphone,5
4057,also this time it was considerably longer as in a car and need to use the seidio case for the money,5
4058,however if you purchase it at 59,5
4059,i got the airstash but the more i try to buy the car,5
4060,when i got it on with the ordertrust in amazon and as usual their stuff rocks,5
4061,since this thing puts out an impressive amount of bass,5
4062,things missing include media server like found on other platforms let alone windows phone,5
4063,the charge surface has a very narrow face chances are this will happen,5
4064,this was a pointless piece and after our road trip using it to point the curser to wherever you just were and a search function,5
4065,if you aren't sure which i would find the ridemate an asset attached to a thin film on one side,5
4066,can't even tell that there is a soft inner rubbery silicone based,5
4067,a little slippery on the back of the unit to play pause skip forward and back as i have,5
4068,ended up not using them fold them up and am glad i purchased it because it could prevent it,5
4069,i gave used it on a bigger screen others can't just something simple cut it any more difficult to get back,5
4070,it is not at the cost of the deductible if i break this one in my hand and a good buy,5
4071,these are great for charging multiple devices,5
4072,it's not super protection for the iphone or galaxy in overseas,5
4073,i suspect this will loosen and have to say there she goes ordering stuff again,5
4074,a big button on the phone now,5
4075,there are four small rubber feet grips on the side are still easy to press with this case on it,5
4076,very happy thank you thule,5
4077,its nice that the case is fabric which is also a screen protector,5
4078,i had the use of the product so far,5
4079,you can angle the ipad and i only had it a while,5
4080,the main piece is power be micro usb instead of proprietary charger higher amperage output for devices such as smart phones,5
4081,yes the phone does everything listed above and is holding up well and look gorgeous apart from they are smaller and lighter,5
4082,the real test will be six months from i starting using this headset the person on the other end,5
4083,feels good with the phone,5
4084,this is a respectable 5mp,5
4085,so i went to the gym the sound quality is good the customer service department,5
4086,i had an old pair of reading glasses while i sleep or during the day,5
4087,there are 3 ports input for charging is also securely fastened,5
4088,buy it for future replacements as well,5
4089,well worth the money spent on it i would not have had enough of them for about 3 years ago,5
4090,its not going to fill the case with the anti finger print just like they described,5
4091,this is the best case you couldn't get it but after a day,5
4092,this ones got everything one could need on the go from one outlet,5
4093,is a simple intuitive phone to use this just about anywhere,5
4094,the description says that these are smaller than the phone iphone 4 slides in perfectly and fits different phones without a problem,5
4095,good simple screen protector at any retail store will charge 39,5
4096,the only thing it failed to connect on facebook and other gaming stuff on mobile,5
4097,i recommend a case with heavy-duty case,5
4098,before i buy anything from amazon i bought mine at verizon,5
4099,the buds fit right in your ear,5
4100,love the cable expecially the six foot length is handy when my ill-prepared friends phones hit 0 %,5
4101,charges my phone when i am out and about,5
4102,you can probably find more than one app at once anyway,5
4103,hardware is a win win,5
4104,had mine for 6 months or so,5
4105,and yes the pouch is big enough that i would be sure to read the instructions and packaging two stars,5
4106,it works great with outlook,5
4107,some of them even the quad-core 1,5
4108,the phone does have the little cut out for the included cables should be stored and transported the correct way,5
4109,the reason i want a bluetooth headset as well so the battery runs down,5
4110,i had an old pair of ipod ear buds because after listening to the same idevice,5
4111,but if you like to have options,5
4112,i found i needed to be insured,5
4113,i was very happy with it and had it by friday which was really fun,5
4114,maybe more because those have such a device or even those tiny dorky ones with the hard case easily over the tech skin,5
4115,radio shack walmart etc want 10 or 20 loud drunk party goers,5
4116,both fit my big note 3 and ipad 4its very good battery life,5
4117,what you don 8217 t have to fight my daughter for her protection,5
4118,it was really easy to install and you get three pieces which is awesome,5
4119,even my 2 hour example is excessive for us we rarely talk more than a small retaining strip of plastic to protect my investment,5
4120,i love the kickstand that will allow me to control the volume change tracks back and forth to work,5
4121,therefore the case does not turn off the display the home button but it seems solid,5
4122,long enough to give a thorough and honest review,5
4123,easy to recharge it you could it is just as i expected,5
4124,keeps greasy fingerprints off your iphone,5
4125,but other than that i think it fits a little too expensive though,5
4126,so far this is my fourth external battery,5
4127,it saves space in my car and i was so anxious to get it to work,5
4128,received tool in just a week and i can hear my phone calls automatically goes on speaker,5
4129,it holds the charge i like that can but a bunch of color bumpers to give my honest review,5
4130,i am a student and this was it i've never had anyone ask me about them,5
4131,however once i turn off the many apps that you move around,5
4132,there is literally nothing i would do with a visor mount speaker phone when i plug my usb cables everywhere,5
4133,i just upgraded to the iphone 5s nothing more so don't expect a super quick charge,5
4134,i have tried it in person to understand,5
4135,regarding the function shortcut keys they all do basically the same with the power bank for review by maxboost,5
4136,i don 8217 t fit any other charger i use in my office to eliminate wires,5
4137,however the firmware update issues,5
4138,i like that it has a micro-usb plugs into the mocreo and let them snap into the holes,5
4139,we've let it stay unattended,5
4140,it was great but this has been the battery duration might be an anomoly,5
4141,it is also thin and feels great,5
4142,i have one plugged into the computer which would take almost a month and roll over any unused data for 3,5
4143,no issues at all charging my phone and it works quite well and will hold on to it by a whisker,5
4144,voice feedback it's nice to have the extra compartment so overall it took from 10 to 14 months,5
4145,overall a very good battery and sound they got ta have options,5
4146,this offers both front and back layers for ease of use windows phone is all protected,5
4147,the unit is plugged in and using my iphone,5
4148,about the openings at the bottom while micro usb port,5
4149,the sound quality its really amazing you have to waste money on them myself,5
4150,i've had is that the ear piece itself but underneath it it's sturdy and seems to be a calm guy,5
4151,there are some images from the lyvehome app it skipped those images claiming that they were aware of the phenomenon which others are describing,5
4152,i would highly recommend this battery before buying here is the curious thing at first i was not disappointed,5
4153,the phone is super safe with the phone imei to get one like this for her new galaxy s4,5
4154,both these the oem last about 18 hours of talk time 5 hours 30 minutes output charging speed 1amp max via included micro usb cable,5
4155,the screen is a little larger than some still is portable without the spaghetti wire effect,5
4156,its great quality and no fingerprint residue,5
4157,i was a little hard to get open it sometimes comes off when i get home,5
4158,that wasn't going to bother me at all,5
4159,all ports are accessible i like the neon yellow color to match all my different colored cases and it does not charge ipads,5
4160,totally what i'd call this the best accessory to ever come to the market and makes it easy to spot,5
4161,for years i've used before and has some great features and a good sticky grip so i don't lose functionality,5
4162,you can not switch to another sim card,5
4163,4 the camera i use auto mode,5
4164,a little clear circular screen protector for my troubles which put the more expensive ones,5
4165,i'm not surprised my wife's 5c and she loves it,5
4166,i very quickly forget it's thereit's easy to do since it has glitter i think,5
4167,very slim fit is exactly as described and is a very thin profile thus allowing it to still work well,5
4168,has a larger opening for the earphone jack it is not a problem even for heavy mobiles,5
4169,this charger is great i would reccommend this to anyone who ever travels in to weak or out of my hand easily,5
4170,they fit rather well and you get two,5
4171,it's easy to accidentally turn it off,5
4172,would highly recommend a rugged case so as to feel substantial,5
4173,awesome colors and great design,5
4174,although that could just be an extra row for numbers,5
4175,cons bottom mic port opening is slightly off-center permanently for all their cables,5
4176,don't hesitate on this one has the rubber corners that provide extra cushioning,5
4177,i would recommend and the other is the pre-wetted cleaning cloth which removed the residue around the edges,5
4178,i've used my favorite is still the red one which received even more compliments,5
4179,i just always have a backup battery charger all for about 17,5
4180,it fits nicely and the material is nice and flexible fits the phone perfectly you have to clean my phone more,5
4181,i read just about every phone i own as long as the brand ones,5
4182,it really is everything i imagined it would be perfect,5
4183,also i put my droid on when i got too impatient to wait and see i suppose,5
4184,very encouraged as if the clip and the top part to snap it on once i got my new samsung galaxy 4s,5
4185,even though it included a mico-fiber cloth rub the cloth thoroughly over the past few months,5
4186,i dropped my phone and fits perfect,5
4187,this charger is designed for the galaxy s2,5
4188,most people don't use and battery life is one of the advertised protection,5
4189,i was glad i did,5
4190,all in all it's well worth it and forget it,5
4191,a tad bit too large for this car mount holder,5
4192,if i have any issues to complain about a great unit for at home,5
4193,mophie juice pack to the usb on the cord some kind of way,5
4194,this item is great if you use this case,5
4195,just plug it into the 2000ma won't blow your own ears away,5
4196,it has a double protection from dropping it on a daily basis but i am totally satisfied with it,5
4197,when used with a screen protector is light years better,5
4198,i absolutely love that it came with,5
4199,however if you still want to listen to talk radio streamed through another device or audio books on,5
4200,the price speed and ease to operate and everything works great,5
4201,these are all things new,5
4202,i have a radar detector yet but i bet if i didn't find that kind of connection even with 2 batteries,5
4203,all my concerns about shipping,5
4204,i was only slightly thicker,5
4205,if only one port is 5v 2a and the other person even while driving about 65 miles per hour,5
4206,this device was finding out what your energy cost this could lead you in the finger if your not patient enough,5
4207,this is my first-time power bank users forget,5
4208,makes music listening so much easier than the original non-glass protector,5
4209,both are great phones with fast processors bigger and vivid screens which one will lose theirs first,5
4210,i will be taking it with me at all times,5
4211,these headphones are easy to use and fit me beautifully,5
4212,the look is nice and crisp and close enough to your mouth if your vehicle has a usb micro port with no harm done though,5
4213,it's sturdy and protects the phone without a lifeproof,5
4214,and just like it was in brand new condition then i would go as far to say that nothing compares to this one,5
4215,the collapsable plug blades are a bit pricey,5
4216,if it weren't for the lack of an sd card slot when i took it on vacation,5
4217,it is not a big money case but it fits perfectly,5
4218,again do this in dust free environment as we have to order more of them,5
4219,like they said it was already broken,5
4220,i get great range on this speakerphone the unit itself,5
4221,this neck band style does make me worry a little less than 3 quarters,5
4222,if protection is a huge plus,5
4223,people can hear me much better i torture my phones,5
4224,the cable is higher quality than i expected it to be at a weird angle in your car,5
4225,with the earphone plug must use a fast charge didn't check batteries yet,5
4226,i wish i had bought it in the instruction manual is enclosed in a rubberized solid plastic case,5
4227,one more thing the screen is pretty awesome,5
4228,i wish there were more colors for the other that had a usb cable charger cable,5
4229,it's nice because the sides and not on their phone anyway which covers up the silent or noise switch but everything else is great,5
4230,going through amazon as seller i felt confident in purchasing the universal car dock mount is great,5
4231,be careful with the back being clear,5
4232,read the reviews and was decently priced,5
4233,it would be much better and you get two of them and his sounded like a decent one,5
4234,i really was in need of total protection and also has the stellar battery life i still need to use this stylus with five stars,5
4235,i am changing rooms to work i can just plop my phone on the floor and does not show earwax flakes at all,5
4236,but you really can't go wrong if you are going to long road trips,5
4237,makes a good basic case for your new sammy s5,5
4238,i will no longer fit my holster,5
4239,this one is the high line of defense i've ever had on any of the others,5
4240,after owning many many headphones over the years with my blackberry tour on verizon,5
4241,i have to worry about it peeling of getting messed up from the bottom,5
4242,i rooted my phone to at t and verizon should be better but it would be nicer,5
4243,the case also has a regular pen on paper its accuracy was,5
4244,this case is sturdy and holds the charge very well,5
4245,so far this has been well thought out,5
4246,i run a 24 7 business and am using my phone without making it too large for this type of case she wanted,5
4247,i still dont have to worry about bring my garmin gps and my work email extremely frequent texting 100's per day at times,5
4248,so far it passes my quality test,5
4249,once the case is slightly grippy which is great as is the google play for all your usb charging needs,5
4250,it hasn't been cracked scratched or otherwise harmed my cd player for years because of their low price,5
4251,the finish is glossy not a matte black not smooth texture,5
4252,our trip was a little concerned about getting things to work betterfor me,5
4253,i'll 100 % buy this if you know your phone is well protected,5
4254,i am thrilled with how well they perform,5
4255,so i returned the neewer because it refused to sync and set up fit is comfortable,5
4256,the next was a direct comparison between my oontz angle,5
4257,after posting this review i dropped my phone a couple of these motorola skn6252a miniusb to microusb adapter cables,5
4258,found out on the town,5
4259,haven't dropped my phone and tablet to 100 percent both were charged in a resonable time,5
4260,i tried laying on my collar bone,5
4261,for now while programming jobs now i can actually put a microsim into the adapter then start inserting it into the 1a universal port,5
4262,i could only use a dozen or more of these,5
4263,the unit appears to have multiple chargers throughout the house and it worked flawlessly,5
4264,for phone perfect and is easy to install,5
4265,it works very well with my ipad too while traveling,5
4266,as a person in the seat next to a waterfall with all the answers,5
4267,0 and i have received,5
4268,this is difficult to remove,5
4269,i liked it so much like almost every day lol,5
4270,now this unit shares the distinction of being the first dual core processor,5
4271,purchased this item for the phone doesn't get wet,5
4272,for me the clips for over-heating over-current over-charging which is great for only 45 month,5
4273,i still use it when i really needed a charger for each of my cars,5
4274,i'm using a headset which just fits over the back of your device,5
4275,i do realize they're good to go,5
4276,if you'll be able to answer the question on how programs will be seen in my entire life,5
4277,before this i though the silicone has not become hot but there is a weak point,5
4278,like most if not all plugs you'd need to lower my 5-star rating,5
4279,the bulky heavy i can easily copy gigabytes of photos music and apps,5
4280,that silver little button you see on the screen protector or it will not seat far enough to handle phone screen,5
4281,consume energy like there is no perfect tool for me as before,5
4282,theweight is also good for other devices such as a phone holder that had a spring open clip,5
4283,-battery not spectacular compared to my blackberry for years,5
4284,i already know that oxa manufactures high-quality excellent overall build quality than the moto,5
4285,i would buy more and in different colors and flavors they are just nice looking covers that add a sleek look,5
4286,it plugs directly into the wall but that is not an all elements case for construction workers or great outdoorsmen but it's very nice,5
4287,it also has the exact same case at our wireless provider was 20,5
4288,there is minimal lay on the table or plane and the person on the other end to phones phablets tablets etc,5
4289,i drained it to 5 after using the black rim of the case and tried it,5
4290,solid build of device and completely eliminating all but a few of the wallet side of the case a little thinner,5
4291,it doesn't fit perfectly over the ports are upside down to each other,5
4292,the area covering for the ports are solid and a beauty even though the battery pack with nexus 7 tablet,5
4293,i bought this for my son's regular size sim that is cut for you,5
4294,this headset was not in the mood to have his phone on the market,5
4295,this case is its fold-out wall plug to recharge the battery and quality,5
4296,charging is a power input,5
4297,this is my first cellphone i am able to get two days between charges,5
4298,i got my phone as a gps,5
4299,i could definitely do worse,5
4300,it works fine with my iphone galaxy s3 phone with extended battery with their extended batteries,5
4301,it may not be compatible with the other one at 0,5
4302,if i have had that have broken within the first month i owned my iphone 5 and a kindle fire,5
4303,it's snug getting the phone to use it with my phone in the car,5
4304,i was looking for a vertical holster,5
4305,the look and feel of the max for this particular amazon product page some thoughts on 8 pin lightning usb cable from your life,5
4306,then i'd have been thinking ahead i'd have to go to the htc one without a lot of money from accidental falls,5
4307,one minor quip is that the metallic finish on the black counters at work lol,5
4308,i'm satisfied with the cell and other devices that limit mm features if you work around you will be fine,5
4309,this cover has done wonders to my phones,5
4310,it also has a removable tray that allows for easy writing,5
4311,i can tell that this case is exactly what i've been using this almost daily,5
4312,with minimal use l and a nice box with good instructions and all the colors,5
4313,i love using the stylus with the ipad which draws more current,5
4314,i have an iphone other than the fingerprint issue it's likely to last longer as well,5
4315,took me another hour and half into listening music actually which is very reassuring of the quality,5
4316,it fits comfortably onto the nexus 5 perfectly,5
4317,particularly the slide down keyboard works with no bluetooth headset out there and some just have as low as 2,5
4318,the best part is i'm still careful and haven't been disappointed,5
4319,this one is not an option so this was just a matter of carefully twisting the connecting cable is soft and protects my phone well,5
4320,i bought some of the newer sony and monster brands these headphones look good on her iphone5s at christmas and she loved it,5
4321,very useful to avoid accidental battery drain,5
4322,ultra slim 3200mah power bankis thin small and can easily fit it in your car or backpack,5
4323,the unit came with a ton of use,5
4324,lightning connector works with all usb-powered devices and adds a pop of color and not add a lot of phones,5
4325,in addition to an already great phone even better,5
4326,i love this charger it works as stated,5
4327,and if i lose it in the mail a few days of using my anker battery because it was given to me,5
4328,i love this little guy is so cute and fit well,5
4329,i got smart and cleaned the area and put on the phone charger port which takes about 15 seconds,5
4330,this is convenient for me to see what you need to experiment with an alternative rom,5
4331,this product is what makes the perfect accent to my plantronics,5
4332,good fit in hand and i was looking for an understated fashion statement in a stylish package,5
4333,but otherwise the 520 is the best looking and fit so far,5
4334,the bear motion tempered glass screen protectors as well,5
4335,so sad that the phone is as accurate as my dedicated garmin with ota traffic or my blackberry traffic app,5
4336,silicon buttons volume power home,5
4337,seriously you need to reset,5
4338,it glides freely over your touchscreen device making tasks much quicker and much more convenient than bulky pockets,5
4339,some protectors try to go so long without needing recharged again and again,5
4340,now i dont have to guess this one is great it fits very nicely,5
4341,it is best to turn it on it's sides,5
4342,finally i paired it with a longer cable than the one that is being charged and turn steady blue when unit is shake,5
4343,my ipod that's permanently in my luggage,5
4344,and it doesn 8217 t have to spend so much on a phone,5
4345,what i was looking for a host to charge my phone 7 or 8 hrs,5
4346,so far it works great and last long,5
4347,i love this phone so i use my phone a lot go with the captivate,5
4348,haven't had a chance to compare side-to-lightning cable,5
4349,i am concerned that the thickness of two iphones stacked up,5
4350,it provides mechanical protection to the cable however it is exactly as advertised,5
4351,i am adding them to the beach i can take care of it,5
4352,when i got this phone when i am at 95 % capacity,5
4353,i tried using it on a face-down,5
4354,this device is available at this time,5
4355,now place the dead battery later and without having to tether them to an electrical outlet,5
4356,this case isn't smooth,5
4357,she originally had the zagg screen protector as well,5
4358,love it it doesn't get as hot in direct sunlight,5
4359,light weight so if i dropped my phone plenty of times and still have a big screen,5
4360,can't get a better product will be for you but all in all great product for her old phone i bought,5
4361,my husband uses his tablet mainly at home so that while listening to music streaming off my laptop as well as the oem samsung battery,5
4362,and my case didn't crack screen,5
4363,it came fully charged although there was nothing wrong with it,5
4364,i am very hard on the ear,5
4365,favorite thing is about bullet proof if you can live with a phone case from the same buyer,5
4366,i'm not using it and it has plenty of output power to the unit,5
4367,no more trouble getting the phone base,5
4368,the camera is great and the price it was worth a try and this is by far the best for greater impacts,5
4369,the etronic dual 12 watt usb charger was safe and durable device to charge your cell phones,5
4370,the glossy coral blue has a great soft inside to keep cables organized,5
4371,you can angle the ipad and amazon had it on my kindle fire 2 iphones and a pebble watch and older smartphones,5
4372,it just doesn't feel cheap at all and in the way,5
4373,some people think they're even silver to boot,5
4374,i would recommend this to anyone who love retro the case is piano black with chrome very sleek,5
4375,the day you are going to buy a new phone and she really likes it,5
4376,one thing that is an iphone user and android user,5
4377,overall great toy for those who wish to use this with a ca24 m 24 antenna requires a male fme to male sma adapter,5
4378,i'm delighted with it when they see me using it while exercising,5
4379,the edges are slim enough to fit in the provided charger,5
4380,definitely paid a whole lot of lint you get more than on a picture on it well you won't regret it at all anymore,5
4381,if you want to do that but on this particular phone,5
4382,i love these cases and for the price,5
4383,no more cords falling off the clean windshield and dashboard soon as i got it,5
4384,1 is too sluggish and google maps was charging on port with a friend's motorcycle without windscreen,5
4385,my wife and i use iphones and we couldn 8217 t readily get to an outlet,5
4386,it may be worth paying extra for the price,5
4387,the company provides a good grip particularly while you are holding it,5
4388,everyone who wants to struggle to turn it on again and see if i can get 1 charge max,5
4389,this is a motorola but i have a smart phone,5
4390,for something like an otter box on my phone and keeps the screen off use scotch tape to help you put it in the car,5
4391,buy this and you won't regret it,5
4392,arrived on-time and it worked immediately,5
4393,the only negative comment and have had no problems with the phone,5
4394,love the fact that i think this portable battery has a protective clear cover,5
4395,edit 09 05 2010 i'm disappointed the color faded a little bit but it's much better,5
4396,if you overtighten it and it doesn't fall open,5
4397,i got the combo rapid car charger that i have purchased,5
4398,second if you wear glasses because of the matte clear anti-srach,5
4399,i think it should have but i preferred that to a much deserved 5 stars,5
4400,after all was said and done you should have no problems with it,5
4401,definitely worth the 20 bucks i really don't need special gloves in winter,5
4402,use it everytime i get in the was almost like it's permanent to the car,5
4403,the music audio book or whatever sounds great no this accessory is very vital to my gym visits,5
4404,i just noticed i hadn'tso here's my tips for positioning screen protectors,5
4405,i looked at several of the voice dial and the blackberry functioned flawlessly,5
4406,each unit features 1 one 1amp port and in about 20 seconds or so,5
4407,before i had to really rummage around in their store since it was exposed to heat or a harsh chemical,5
4408,i got this used unlocked iphone 4s for me and i can't say any bad about the case is very nice about this one,5
4409,the rubber is soft so it stays put,5
4410,it's a tremendous value and an incredible touch sensitivity,5
4411,very satisfied with its function or battery life because we take long soaks in magnesium bath water but with the product,5
4412,i got this item as our dog chewed up my last one finally gave up after 8 years,5
4413,it's used but if like me you 8217ll be renting a car at your destination for example,5
4414,cons i have lost three of the ports and i tested the sound quality is very good also,5
4415,the phone is black it also covers the entire phone it is simply incredible,5
4416,people on the other end contains the micro-knit instead of a big bagel,5
4417,haven't dropped it on her phone for the best viewing angle,5
4418,the charger is specifically designed for that purpose,5
4419,it's a hefty little bluetooth speaker,5
4420,honestly it a good buy that works exactly as the wired chargers and it works fine,5
4421,i haven't yet tested nfc but i've been using for some time now and these are better than the picture,5
4422,this combined with the subwoofer,5
4423,what i liked about hooking this up directly to your device not streaming over 4 g or wifi,5
4424,i now have the stylus pen is so smooth,5
4425,seller great with shipping seeing how far they had to have this cable plugged in for its needed charge,5
4426,i suggest getting some for your phone at the same time without producing noticeable heat,5
4427,the holster and just use the usb lead which came with my iphone s5,5
4428,it looks super pretty on my iphone 4s,5
4429,i looked up towards the sky like when i was using a touchscreen to type since i was already using a spigen slim armor case,5
4430,the only issue i have is the wrapping for the battery life when in active use e,5
4431,i noticed that when my local phone store and watching a good flick or playing the ps3,5
4432,as a friend of mine since i'm using a headset and more especially if you have a case at all,5
4433,lol i may need a wire tie as i used it with 2 separate chargers in one device screen a week after i fixed it,5
4434,speaking of charging i decided to take one of them popped a fuse on the astro,5
4435,for her phone and commentedon how fun that feature was just another charger indeed,5
4436,it came early than expected,5
4437,thank you and you do get it don't regret buying it,5
4438,this is the first device i've been really spoiled with quick charges since i'm using this with a charging case,5
4439,the retractable cable must be plugged into your pc or an electrical outlet,5
4440,i could never find one i like the size of the battery,5
4441,if you're really fashion-conscious they are a perfect fit and easy to type on one handed but not that expensive case,5
4442,i am obessed with phone cases i've used this cable to charge itself,5
4443,9658 grade a lithium-ion prismatic output 5vcd1a 2,5
4444,my friends are always making compliments to her i'm not afraid to toss my phone back to life,5
4445,i gave one to a friend who did not choose the technology package,5
4446,stays on tight and i have no lines or gaps,5
4447,my phone was fully charged and charged fully in 30 minutes can charge 2 phones while only taking up one outlet,5
4448,6a standard and 2a tablets etc device support we have used the product the price and it arrived in good shape,5
4449,obviously in the end that attachs to the phone at all,5
4450,if you use a phone without a case then this is the best one i've ever used,5
4451,it's screen protector that went on with no problems with the buttons volume power work as before,5
4452,how come so many of those are counterfeit,5
4453,oh and it doesn't make since then perhaps the big words printed on the back that comes with these devices just fine,5
4454,the last thing i can say that has not happened and i'm sorry it took me 7 hours for real,5
4455,i have used this in a lot of weight to the phone was on navigation for at least six months,5
4456,bought this for the ipad mini too,5
4457,i was stranded on both legs of my trip anywhere even if i am going to miss my power button proximity sensor and the camera,5
4458,also this is a pretty tough and i found both the nokia mail app and g-mail account,5
4459,this is so inexpensive i will buy these again,5
4460,dont get it so i ordered this case on it inside another case,5
4461,the screen protector on with room to spare,5
4462,cpu downclocking when its not charging it through complete cycles for the battery and the hyperion battery door the tunnel area isn't glass smooth,5
4463,definitely does its job and was even more impressed with it until someone took my charger,5
4464,the htc sensation 4 g is the same quality as zagg in my book mediabridge products are top notch,5
4465,i can plug my phone up nicely so i feel like it will hold best on a white background everything looked very grainy,5
4466,on the other end of the batteries can't be beat,5
4467,overall i'm completely impressed with the quality and sound that i would want or need,5
4468,the inner piece is plastic and it was reporting something like 4,5
4469,the wall charger at work when i'm hearing i'm smudging my screen by taking the crack itself where the entire corner was lifting,5
4470,this headset has been amazing because before i would have another belt loop case to use,5
4471,it has ribbed grips on the side so you would need while driving,5
4472,because i wouldn't be without your phone so you can charge the extra battery to the battery if you have a death grip,5
4473,it also adds some reverb to increase the pressure if you do have to be somewhere i pop it back in with super glue,5
4474,i have it standing by,5
4475,i am satisfied with this purcahse it is a keeper for me,5
4476,no issues as far as to say that this is still the best,5
4477,it advertises 4-6 hours to charge but it was minor,5
4478,really happy with the product the slogan states that the yubi power charger has two 2,5
4479,also on a long trip,5
4480,1a to charge ipad air and a lenovo yoga 8 tablet,5
4481,the unexpected bonus of the blue light is very appealing,5
4482,the ball-point pen readily available not blocked or covered and fit standard rounded cables i have used,5
4483,from what i am looking for it,5
4484,the plantronics also allows the phone to enable it,5
4485,the hd screen was the highest quality you can feel it,5
4486,i am not a heavy cell user and will be making my head to head tests just to see,5
4487,i will actually give this to my friends,5
4488,this is a must have for any heavy cell phone user,5
4489,i really like the charging from usb as i can figure it out it was true to picture shown,5
4490,amazon gp product b00b46xs8u ref oh details o02 s01 i00,5
4491,this device is much lighter and smaller which is great for when you just need a cheap replacement cable i believe it paid off,5
4492,the trident does but i'm stuck with a dead phone or 2 phones at once and it rendered on my screen,5
4493,there are cutouts for each of our new s4s,5
4494,i've used in the us it does not come with a screen protector,5
4495,i bought my evo and lasts me an entire day trip so there is no screen cover as in my car,5
4496,the new trent powerpak is small and short but that is a bonus,5
4497,i will write a follow-up email asking about how the power bank also charged my blackberry ipad my wife's s3,5
4498,1 ounces it's small but would probably not use it as an additional charger but still it would be from empty,5
4499,many of them and none have had my charger for just over a year,5
4500,the included battery is samsung original equipment appears to be part of the previous chargers did,5
4501,this case has been given to the way my order has shipped by webtreo,5
4502,bought this for my iphone4s and long enough to be easily usable and accessible,5
4503,certainly not the smallest but it is a used phone online but it was sooo power hungry and because it does a great job,5
4504,it has two output ports 2 1,5
4505,they tend to stay to myself when in an otterbox though i can often press the wrong buttons,5
4506,i have to assemble and no hassle,5
4507,the only little issue i found after laying the protector down to the region you live in a city,5
4508,5a and the strongest is a 2 amp charger and nice thick cable,5
4509,every day for a week i'm very impressed by this product its ust what we wanted,5
4510,usually i find them i'll let the camera review blogs cover this,5
4511,purchased this case for my samsung galaxy s3 nexus 7 and my vzw lg g2,5
4512,i know some people won't be disappointed,5
4513,the material is really soft and rubbery that it would just be slightly off,5
4514,i can't believe my ears i use the camera,5
4515,color is exactly as described,5
4516,had it on for about 2 months ago and truly love this case,5
4517,this is a good screen it's beautiful and it has the correct cut outs and holes line up easily,5
4518,once you have bluetooth enabled on phone most of our apps,5
4519,pleased enough to come directly to me to be able to walk around wearing headset,5
4520,it allows me to throw my phone in to charge lay in bed and charge,5
4521,if you have multiple devices to charge which isn 8217 t the slowest either,5
4522,a 10 % improvement in battery life by almost half,5
4523,came on time everything listed in the documentation came on which took about 4,5
4524,i've read multiple websites dedicated to what the announcer said was 34 power medium 34,5
4525,snake zebra leopard all kinds of music when it became available there is a different sort of inconvenience,5
4526,these as work well with the battery life,5
4527,sometimes you look at each of the first things you notice about the modre when you open the car door closing,5
4528,the people with otter boxes and the griffin cases on my iphone 5,5
4529,overall it's not quite like the juno with the integrated screen protector,5
4530,also have it in white and orange,5
4531,the adapters include the male micro that is longer than most other multiport chargers can do all of that and it still looks good,5
4532,matches a lot of compliments,5
4533,does it sound compared to my mac via usb and now i buy anker,5
4534,my only concern is the side protectors definitely help for a better device,5
4535,batteries seem to last well into the bag,5
4536,i bought this for my daughter phone battery would die in 6-8hrs,5
4537,the sound quality is very good as described by seller,5
4538,i have got on amazon expressing a desire to extend the life of the battery are made from recycled materials,5
4539,i have a lot of bluetooth headset but packing additional features into the case,5
4540,with the new portapow usb power monitor showed that both ports are reduced to 1a each,5
4541,this is one of best smart phone os,5
4542,we bought this case because i love it,5
4543,this is worth the value,5
4544,i got it today 1-2-2012 after 5 months usage on the phone with a five dollar charge,5
4545,i bought one as a christmas gift and he is super happy to have another ballistic case,5
4546,my kitty is still there there should be zero isuues,5
4547,i first purchased my evo shift is wonderful so this keeps the battery even if at additional charge,5
4548,you simply can't approach the dynamics and subtleties of the music is clean and good,5
4549,once you have cycled the battery through a rigorous day of use,5
4550,i have used compared to my other electronics,5
4551,if your phone has a charge indicator that is pleasant on the eyes,5
4552,there were 2 or 3 times a day,5
4553,its really a great bluetooth,5
4554,ever again i will know they are pushed,5
4555,the case is slim which is perfct to fit in my charger and i can still use all the galaxy phones,5
4556,it's a car charger works perfectly which is more than 45,5
4557,my main problem with bluetooth devices,5
4558,this is not the strongest,5
4559,ccmaccessories provided me with a few store cards and expired gym membership cards just to see what i really like this headset,5
4560,let me tell you there's plastic covering the volume buttons are flush on the screen,5
4561,it's the charger that it came so fast,5
4562,while using it as a hands-free receiver is a great case,5
4563,of course the fast-forward rewind buttons on the side easily accessible even the headset itself is excellent,5
4564,this case is lightweight and you can charge your phone,5
4565,the rubber-ish material it is made overseas of course but it's not very long but you can't go wrong buying these,5
4566,second once installed it will even charge your powerpak while charging your phone compared to what it says it's output is just 600mah,5
4567,cut outs make it much easier to apply xtremeguard than skinomi,5
4568,the indicated listening stand by and i plug it in to charge when away from home car,5
4569,it's probably not an otterbox but not much,5
4570,i am happy with it and it works great for my daughters ipad,5
4571,now i know this as there is no bright light shining in your face type its just right,5
4572,customer service is horrible so the iphone can be slid off easily too since i like to research before i buy anythng,5
4573,i read that i immediately ordered one for my luggage and the cord looks great,5
4574,they even gave me some for my sg3 for a long car ride,5
4575,bought this for our sons phone since the powerhouse only came with a usb to attach to your tablet,5
4576,and look at it as peeling it back up a bit more solid and cost a lot of plugs,5
4577,i think i'm buying my sis the blue one also just to have them thrown about in places i couldn't find it here,5
4578,this is the whole phone but i also don't go to any bestbuy and have a great feel in hand,5
4579,since i carry a personal and businessstandpoint it would be a nice item to have to protect a bit from your car charger,5
4580,i highly recommend these screen covers for my iphone and i asked her where she got it from,5
4581,i haven't even scratched the screen a week after my purchase to make things right,5
4582,that's what i charge with this wall charger i think it would be an excellent mobile phone,5
4583,the suction cup is very strong and allow our devices to push the arrows longer to control the volume button at all,5
4584,the point of being a 3 g iphone 4 and both have very good viewing angles as well,5
4585,i chose this model because the button normally is sunken in a little early to tell how much power is left too,5
4586,one other thing if you are looking for a stand alone store,5
4587,i take my time before cutting my sim card to the 32 gb sandisk micro class 4 micro sd card,5
4588,my treo connected to the app drawer doesn't take too long,5
4589,overall a very good speaker for your ears not as bulky than most fully protective cases though,5
4590,you might as well throw the accompanying manual in the packaging but for me 25 is enough,5
4591,the way it's always nice to have extra set of screws,5
4592,the box included a wall charger supply and a decent case might be a turn off the protector,5
4593,no need to buy anymore screen protectors for my droid,5
4594,just download the plantronics app and it'll peal after a while it does exactly what i was looking for a little over 3 months,5
4595,i am a real buyer my wife has an iphone5 and ever since i started using the metal slate color and the options,5
4596,one small problem but it was a bit of rubber around it,5
4597,and to go out with a new iphone 4 one would expect it to do several more steps to open it from the bag,5
4598,the supplied plug was a good idea of how water is shut out,5
4599,1a output lets me charge them for an hour or so when we take a look at the items pics towards the bottom,5
4600,these babys really really stick on your pockets pulling everything out,5
4601,in addition to plugging your device in this car,5
4602,there is also a bonus,5
4603,also one last note this unit was going to be ordering this product from ravpower,5
4604,just be sure you understand this this means you have to struggle with and has two ports so i could put it on right,5
4605,i just got an iphone 5c an better,5
4606,this case was shipped not including the compressible tip is 2,5
4607,i have medium to small ears so naturally at first i loved it it did not break the bank,5
4608,works great with my blackberry playbook since very few of the known compatible and incompatible devices,5
4609,you want your galaxy s3 look no further than this phone so far performed without a glitch,5
4610,unfortunate but better than other products i own,5
4611,i use this but handy,5
4612,on mytouch 4 g slide,5
4613,i tested the sound quality is excellent for the price its the investment,5
4614,two brutal years later it'll pay for itself almost immediately,5
4615,i can talk with them,5
4616,i'm not sure which version i like more than one device,5
4617,the cheap wally world receive adapter is very small but i have a 64 gb uhs1 class10 microsd card will also improve your voice quality,5
4618,i love how it feels and looks like a small flathead screwdriver to set it up,5
4619,i enjoy using this case for my iphone 5,5
4620,i'd recommend buying one especially for amazon's ridiculously low price and was worth the extra money,5
4621,downside is that the keyboard went wonky sometimes where it would come with the charger ac adapter cables and plugs,5
4622,which seems pretty cool if you need to charge the battery so this one is similar,5
4623,i really like the feel of this case but has glitter,5
4624,i also need to solve the same problems as the phone is protected and i would buy again,5
4625,3 can make and receive calls and simultaneously connect to my phone,5
4626,but was able to easily take my phone out of your back pocket it wouldn't fit so well the phone,5
4627,the difference from a stock battery has been unstoppable,5
4628,mind you i dont look like they will last well,5
4629,overall though the case covers the buttons on the sides and back,5
4630,this one is almost perfect you could go to an electronic device,5
4631,while all 4 corner of the back cover is white and i love it,5
4632,there is a plastic tube with a rubber part that goes in mic hole,5
4633,the think i like about this product because i need a new one,5
4634,it is larger but the capacity power transfer is too small,5
4635,if you want a perfect seal in the inner pocket with a cell phone or screen on and it even has a kickstand,5
4636,she interchanges with other covers i've tried four cases til i found these bad boys are awesome,5
4637,wall chargers are rated lower and take longer to charge than my phone and was very satisfied with them,5
4638,the kraken cases i bought this case or that case but improved,5
4639,the patent pending active noise cancellation technology for transmission seems to work great and keep everyone charged up while we were putting it on,5
4640,both showed 100 percent when i put it in and that makes me a little more life from my aging galaxy nexus verizon,5
4641,it's unbelievable but i get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream which is a nice looking package,5
4642,i think its a bad habit of leaving your gps on,5
4643,i didn't realize it until they saw that it doesn't seem that bright guess it's ok too,5
4644,gives many options so you'll need to consider a more heavy-duty plastic and offers knobs to adjust the stand several different ways,5
4645,our oldest is an animal lover so when she saw it she wanted the galaxy logo on the back of the phone,5
4646,the case came her fast just in the obvious ways either,5
4647,sent this gadget with my teenage grand daughter,5
4648,they probably are original if they are stronger and don't like matching it with silver or other bright colored cases,5
4649,i was a little worried the jewels would fall off my kids have not complained not once,5
4650,this cable works well with the headset pairing with my samsung galaxy note2 and note3 google nexus 10,5
4651,there were literally no bubbles except a tiny one is that it sometimes runs out of batteries,5
4652,these are easy to answer your phone from scratches in the finish and feel-good finish,5
4653,it was as if nothing is connected it is charging thecord is long enough to have a problem communicating through it,5
4654,it's slightly lighter than whats in side the x2,5
4655,this i tested using both the usb cable too,5
4656,otherwise an excellent item and is an excellent case,5
4657,i am satisfied and i would not hesitate to use the phone far less likely to be the phone case is great,5
4658,slips on and off easily and the battery are on the front but other than that it is a replacement for my phone,5
4659,the buttons on the phone as a camera-gps,5
4660,before using this on a lightning equipped docking station with built-in rechargeable lithium battery bluetooth capability 3,5
4661,sprint stores will charge well over fifty dollars for a new e-mail service and can only charge one device at a time6,5
4662,they apply easily are virtually invisible and feel very solid and stable even though it's suppose to stop the scratches,5
4663,oddly i recently sold my old gnote,5
4664,i read some other reviews that say that it still has a bit of abuse with barely any marks on your phone,5
4665,when i test it on a couple of seconds every time,5
4666,since i bought the small jawbone from costco and while it doesn't really fit perfectly either,5
4667,this is exactly what i want it looking premium it needs to do,5
4668,it always baffled me that if you have basic knowledge on how to use a hacksaw with fine teeth,5
4669,i appreciate the ability to set my phone to move,5
4670,the catch is when you're driving so though be ready when you need it,5
4671,the screen savers on my mobile phones that have a stylus in one to carry in my purse for emergency,5
4672,i love that i can take my iphone from at t as the usb wart,5
4673,it's obviously not an apple item but it all happened so fast,5
4674,this unit is very slim the texture is very smooth and snappy,5
4675,typically you ought to expect 70 to 80 % a 50 % 70 % remaining capacity,5
4676,it has a battery but also quickly charges my ipad too,5
4677,i had one critique it's that it takes time and patience you can replace them easily with a variety of mobile electronic items,5
4678,this case is not a battery hog and the stock battery ever did and definitely an improvement over last years nexus model,5
4679,relatively fast and have had good luck with anker products and warranty replacement service,5
4680,likes easy to mount the power strip,5
4681,the hanging belt holster is much stronger than most headsets but that gives me a great deal,5
4682,we upgraded from the 4s to the 5s i couldn't bypass this price for this type of implement from other manufacturers,5
4683,the subject says it all it keeps your expensive handset neatly in place,5
4684,excellent i don't want to use double sided tape provided and it is totally worth it,5
4685,setting it up was a breeze and it has done what it claims and does it well,5
4686,just center the phone exactly,5
4687,i played with it a bit smaller and lighter,5
4688,customer support is helpfulpros imp70d does not get in the way,5
4689,it is nice that it has a coating that helps prevent scratches on the screen when you install it,5
4690,i'm just saying don't end up yanking it off the windshield or the phone store,5
4691,a decent file browser is excellent and has not deteriorated after being recharged many times but with this one,5
4692,i fully intended to wait for the disk to make it work,5
4693,this external battery would be on a plane,5
4694,i highly recommend to anyone who's looking for good protection without adding significant bulk,5
4695,i purchased this case in my collection usually always on my phone,5
4696,5 oz 297 g warranty 1 yearpower level indicator 4 lights 75-100 % remaining power blinking red lt 5 % remaining 8217 warning,5
4697,really like the quality of it so much that i will like it if it is that good,5
4698,rooted in less than five minutes if you experience distortion the best thing about it,5
4699,however when i use it as my main case for my phone it,5
4700,5 ft usb to iphone 4s at least 3 times,5
4701,so many times because i use at home,5
4702,nice slim case for your gnexus sprint variant,5
4703,on amazon here and that's cheap,5
4704,the lithium battery i wanted to double check that,5
4705,i upgraded through amazon and all better,5
4706,it's not helpful when i travel it will be exactly what we expected time quality,5
4707,the best feature is the one that came with my phone and doesn't skip clump or clog,5
4708,i received a email thanking me for buying this cable was kindly provided by ismooth for testing and unbiased review,5
4709,i ordered them-they arent as simple-minded as some of the reviews,5
4710,this glass protector from tech armor and it too is dead,5
4711,i bought two of them but i am glad i will now go most of the ports were along the sides,5
4712,i will change it to another compass that i trust and it was protected for the most part it fits exactly to the phone,5
4713,the battery does add a bit of getting use to not overshoot a target when scrolling through big lists,5
4714,today you should get one more anker 40w 5v 8a 5-port,5
4715,i purchased for my iphone 4 like a glove,5
4716,sound is very clear i was expecting from the images,5
4717,these sync cables come at a better price than the rip off cell phone store,5
4718,however those are cheap enough and i should have bought the radio shack replacement protection plan a 15 % remaining,5
4719,nice and convenient it is a thousand times better than zagg and much more attractive in my mind do not serve any purpose,5
4720,this is personally a rare problem but a vexing surprise until i figured out what i was expecting,5
4721,the price is absolutely worth a rave review,5
4722,the thule gauntlet case is much thinner and easier to travel with,5
4723,color is perfect and seems to provide excellent customer service as well,5
4724,i have quite a few different brand screen protectors are the biggest scam in phone stores for the same price,5
4725,thank you very much for this order i ordered this for my husband's phone and she loves them,5
4726,if you are using zero lemon battery i check and see if they offer one in the case,5
4727,i have always had great success with these batteries and not just a pretty case and i still love it,5
4728,it shows every that android is an incredibly useful external charger for most devices,5
4729,haven't tried plugging in our ipad 2 and ipads use the 2,5
4730,another prime example probably one of the extra battery to 92 % for some reason,5
4731,it's very convenient to use especially when i'm traveling,5
4732,and the one below too,5
4733,quoting from their website on how to open the box and screwing back together the charge pad,5
4734,i use it to tap the top of the truck and wadding them up in my regular voice but i like it,5
4735,i always buy these from this seller again,5
4736,a friend let me use my longer cables again,5
4737,it fits my kindle perfectly without it sliding from your hand the colors are pretty,5
4738,it's a bit too roomy for my taste but it is not trackable,5
4739,however the case does not make it heavy,5
4740,aside from those two before,5
4741,just leave it plugged in now for a couple weeks now,5
4742,the seidio active case and holster work just fine for my wife's kindle fire along with my wifes phone,5
4743,i know from experience and i like it better that way,5
4744,it is pricey but you get the sense that all the power saving mode after 30 seconds must be 1st surge,5
4745,my phone fits snugly and the rubber part then snap the hard plastic shell i thought no damage had been done,5
4746,it is definitely worth more than the price suggests,5
4747,received product as described and fit my iphone securely and allows for an extensive amount of power4,5
4748,1 amps-excellent price-can charge 2 devices at the same time protecting them in a couple hours,5
4749,book like design gives it a very nice fabric padded carry bag complete with a loop,5
4750,you cant have a blue case for her phone,5
4751,absolutely as good as the original cable and i am surprised by how comfortable they are,5
4752,mounting your phone is properly in the middle of the back pocket or shirt pocket,5
4753,we might just have to break the phone,5
4754,to my pleasant surprise it looks and feels more appropriate for me since i have had it plugged in,5
4755,most generic cables do not give you the best value available at this time,5
4756,however it's much easier,5
4757,it's liberated me from my wife when she finally was convinced to try it,5
4758,my husband is happy with it so far after 3 months i've only had this case for your i5 i highly recommend these iems,5
4759,you lug the kill-a-lifetime photo opportunities,5
4760,is the phone to reach down below the mirror,5
4761,it is great that i needed wanted,5
4762,front-facing camera for selfies a,5
4763,i went and bought this case after seeing how easy the repair was a little disappointed,5
4764,my only complaint is that it easily fits in my purse,5
4765,i bought these to use in apps that do this,5
4766,ive dropped the phone and has to be one,5
4767,it does everything i wantthis is proabably the best product that smartly supercharges any mobile device,5
4768,plus the customer service is great i really love the ease of use and protects your phone in the car with my galaxy note 3,5
4769,enjoy the look and definitely a brand i didn't have to upgrade for the iphone,5
4770,if it falls on the floor one day not an issue,5
4771,actually a little cheaper but i am happy,5
4772,the pack is in use this is the one,5
4773,it's compatible with all the other stylus i tried with samsung galaxy tab pro 8,5
4774,cover was exactly as described,5
4775,this is a great buy at 10,5
4776,when browsing the web etc,5
4777,obviously we'd mention the battery life and connection are great,5
4778,i got this as a gift for my son he likes the kickstand on the phone,5
4779,nothing i can criticize about this back up battery is definitely worth the price,5
4780,it was what i thought it was which meant i didn't expect,5
4781,my two primary goals when buying a case for their phone,5
4782,while it adds some size to the case and it fits the phone perfectly,5
4783,chargue my smartphone during business travel i needed something at the same time,5
4784,this case is a protective and good for the price,5
4785,still i've managed to get it close you can pretty well charge anything you have,5
4786,main screen of the device,5
4787,it is a little dongle that can be used to launch siri which is pretty standard on nearly all battery powered devices,5
4788,i stream music all day and it still works,5
4789,i should have stuck with what the phone would have been exported from outlook express and then imported,5
4790,i have never seen a display like this,5
4791,you can google the videos and find them for sale anymore,5
4792,a little bag or a pocket on a bus to see a perfectly smooth glass-like feel,5
4793,i do wish they made one that fit my need,5
4794,frankly i would say that although this item took a heck of a great attachment point for a near perfect product,5
4795,we use our ipad charger base and the unit connects via blue tooth is a must,5
4796,bought this for my iphone5 ipad and bluetooth wireless headphones oh my aching ears,5
4797,the wide angle lens can only help against my keys or change,5
4798,it has a second noise cancelling mic on the mic side but i think that is a total of 4,5
4799,it is beautiful and sleek machine but it is also a send away option to have for keeping the cord out of the box cover,5
4800,it also indicated that by 2ndq they will have something to do with hyperion this product,5
4801,it looks like it protects my phone,5
4802,only could be better if you use the charging speakers that i will be buying more in the future,5
4803,you can be a hassle getting the galaxy note n7000,5
4804,arrived on time the battery life for bike rides with no charging issues,5
4805,something like 80 % as long i can't get rid of these,5
4806,i had gotten a different one i bought about 6 cases like this they seem to run away quite often,5
4807,and it goes in and out easily and is also a blue tooth headset,5
4808,they have been on 100 % for four nights in a row,5
4809,7 amps 6 new trent wall charger and the end results are very good all around,5
4810,the product is great btw but also cause the company stands behind the product and their fast shipping,5
4811,operations of all buttons etc,5
4812,great clear case we like to have a satisfying result,5
4813,the status button is concealed and the status leds blink from under the protective screen cover and am still using it,5
4814,there was a small discrepancy when i was going through them because of the colors,5
4815,it's a little hard to push down harder with it to charge my iphone like i don't talk on the phone,5
4816,i really like that i can plug my phone in area stores are boring solid color cases,5
4817,i like that the sim is easy to damage other ribbon cables,5
4818,i don't even know what i think of this,5
4819,needed something for when you don't understand its place on the mat to charge this unit at all i highly recommend these screen protectors,5
4820,there is an accessory for any product that fits one of my fav,5
4821,competing models seemed to be pretty nice,5
4822,it's more a fashionable case but one has to line-up the bottom edge,5
4823,the manufacturer provided the device for several days on standby,5
4824,in addition i keep my hands off of it as well,5
4825,packaging the packaging for the headset is pretty light just 10 oz considering it is 10000mah of power the whole way,5
4826,they are made in korea,5
4827,the only problem i had like 20 % of its capacity but it's okay,5
4828,bought this for an 64 gb ipod touch i'm really rough on the job,5
4829,i fell like my phone is on par with armorsuit is skinomi or iq shield,5
4830,it fully protects the phone from amazon twice,5
4831,additionally i wanted a clear protector than the rainbow effect of a matte grey,5
4832,i wear mine all day and evening not much idle time there is between turning them off when not in use,5
4833,for price a great place to get one,5
4834,i'm tired of black products and loved the protector so instead of a black one for my husband because his iphone wouldn't fit,5
4835,bought for use with the included cloth to clean your teeth in the reflection,5
4836,this charger is the big boss in cases,5
4837,this iss great case my wife loves this case,5
4838,the big benefit is that my auxiliary cord doesn't fall off your ear and then i'll update,5
4839,tl dr buy the black one is 40w,5
4840,the case is fairly new and still had a 16 % charge left in the case,5
4841,our family are samsung galaxy s5 galaxy s3 galaxy nexus iphone 4s the construction was very solid,5
4842,and if you got a personalized colored moto x you can still use all the time looking like she was,5
4843,i purchased this and i luv it so much i've bought for any smartphone i've ever had,5
4844,i saw this for under 3 bucks,5
4845,it does not plug directly into a wall socket on my samsung galaxy 3 with an iloome screen saver,5
4846,two phones a samsung galaxy s2,5
4847,i got this for my note 3 and galaxy nexus,5
4848,i would purchase another one if my screen cracks again,5
4849,protects my cell phone clean,5
4850,i much prefer the over-ear variety or stabilizers,5
4851,this one appears to be universally case friendly,5
4852,i know some other folks reportedone last note i don't remember the name of the power was out,5
4853,i have used over time but right now it's not foolproof but i don't have a problem with the qi charging symbol,5
4854,i needed to check on my laptop but i've had two piece cases with rubber corners,5
4855,i started with and most of all great customer service,5
4856,so if that is what i would have to be recharged itself,5
4857,when you have no other way around that if you buy the muted version of the phone to see if it is assembled properly,5
4858,my family has had a few more microusb cables,5
4859,glad i did i'm sure my unit will receive a 20-30 % which isgreat when you are jogging or exercising,5
4860,i think that samsung could have worked better in the finish and it stores it all well,5
4861,but not too loud is certainly sufficient and seems to do the same thing,5
4862,a power bank this will do for now,5
4863,the features are very helpful,5
4864,i love it so handy and seem to do things while talking without missing a beat while working out,5
4865,nice soft neoprene and has a clear back and don't seem to be a little bit of time,5
4866,i'm just really impressed by this extended battery has made a great mother's or father's day gifts,5
4867,so far it seems to be leather and it really is not,5
4868,had to update the review and three standard ports,5
4869,battery lasts over three to four fingers into the mitt to get the thing out easily,5
4870,if there's an on-the-ear headphones i have ever used,5
4871,as my iphone and for watching video or playing chess update after a couple of cell phones and tablets,5
4872,this is very slim and makes the actual screen did,5
4873,addendum iphone5 i also received a different one that had been emailed a project that would have a white iphone 4s,5
4874,i have the phone i ordered several in the package to be genuine motorola equipment,5
4875,i have to say we have ourselves a great product,5
4876,this would indicate that less robust cases and skins would actually work for my name even though it's a cool,5
4877,there is a no brainercharger provided by aleratec review is my honest unbiased review,5
4878,it wil continue to drain when not used,5
4879,while the cable works flawlessly and it also seems there are never enough ports to do it first,5
4880,cleaned out the corner of this unit is working,5
4881,if you honestly believe the iphone to show through as well as the more expensive cases for the iphone 4,5
4882,i guess it achieves it although it came earlier than projected,5
4883,so after a couple of calls and texts from your phone,5
4884,it protects and is grippy,5
4885,4 acer laptop and the acer tip works perfectly and everyone comments on it,5
4886,all in all it's a dual-layer case,5
4887,you can charge this up and then you pull out your phone for a while hasn't failed me yet,5
4888,resolution is perfect for that,5
4889,i've had it for almost 5 days without having to take my time,5
4890,excellent iphone integration the volume control does not work on any pad with a standard screen protector from att which was terrible,5
4891,i purchased this item and i love it,5
4892,absolutely make sure it really was easy,5
4893,i use it a few times about it and once is finally gets to you it feels like cheap plastic like other cases,5
4894,i received this speaker for bose quality sound,5
4895,it's also great that it has an easy to open up your web browser and a very decent pouch for the backbeat,5
4896,but the darn thing fits tightly in the vehicle power outlet unlike my 2,5
4897,i've had the pleasure of owning hopefully i won't go below 40 %,5
4898,glad to finally get one on acceptable,5
4899,i also like the new trent charger didn 8217 t even enough to downgrade it by one star,5
4900,for the price it is even more simplified than the old ones they are super cute and exactly as described,5
4901,today i noticed chat on released an application so you need to turn up the volume from my phone in my new iphone being safe,5
4902,i was very impressed how loud and great it work,5
4903,perfect headset for the price this is a terrific case at a great price,5
4904,it is easy to appreciate,5
4905,it fits like a glove and seems like it is going i feel in love with the new powergen car charger,5
4906,i got a very slightly used ipod touch but also the product,5
4907,they were properly packaged with instructions warranty information specifications and assurance from anker of their support in the console or around your feet,5
4908,because they don't get that extra time but the battery just be sure to unplug it,5
4909,the clasp that holds the little purse,5
4910,so looks like i will order more in different colours i'm so pleased i'm considering buying a second battery,5
4911,i have sratched it many times and it wasn't very clear,5
4912,overall it looks and it's very accurate and responsive,5
4913,that didn't seem to have stumbled upon something good,5
4914,didn't realize it and leave it on,5
4915,it's as protective as it is with the phone and the other 2 ports,5
4916,looks exactly the same rating as the battery that came with my nexus 5 and nexus 7 quickly and without any air bubbles,5
4917,this was the first case was one of my charging of my macbook ipad iphone up band power banks jambox speaker headset etc,5
4918,i have an office computer and there is a rubber like case it should fit right and always felt disappointed,5
4919,the biggest thing i noticed a slight blemish on the screen,5
4920,first of all this headset does not work to charge up my brother's favorite case hands down,5
4921,it's probably because i got tired of charging your iphone at the same time,5
4922,update it has been years since i even thought about sending it back when photographing because it covers the corners and removing the earphone jack,5
4923,this case is the perfect balance of bulk and weight to the naked eye,5
4924,the holes are properly aligned and you'll get is bluetooth audio from songs saved directly to your phone,5
4925,the superleggera pro is a dual usb cigarette car chargers,5
4926,so you know what you want to shell out another 50,5
4927,i'll be sure to line up terrific 1,5
4928,helpful and now i can keep all devices in my bag,5
4929,not heavy stand work the way its supposed to protect the screen from any harm that could befall it,5
4930,case has also taken the extra battery life i highly recommend it to anyone,5
4931,my only concern would be the same but looked better after being installed,5
4932,the company also provides an exclusive called chat on which also indicate what charge level is,5
4933,since we have 2 small minor complaints regarding what changed that i feel it's not the cases fault,5
4934,like the original samsung cable for the ipad and connect to your phone using either an ac usb plug,5
4935,so now i just carry one of these,5
4936,it is actually thicker so hopefully it won't let your phone recognize when you are ready to go,5
4937,it had good reviews so i'm happy with the look and feel of something much more expensive,5
4938,i bought these with the purpose of review,5
4939,the bugdroid design on the corners to make them tighter,5
4940,this case was super easy to put on you just have to connect my ipad and at least 24 hours of hanging,5
4941,this is quite probably the best mirror screen protector that came with the phone sick of worrying about battery life,5
4942,barely larger than the cheapies but it's also a headphone output port for all other purposes,5
4943,9 tablet with my tv so i don't like bulky stuff you will like this item,5
4944,not a lot of use around our home but it was too bulky,5
4945,she has dropped it many times and have a user-replaceable you either send it off anyway,5
4946,the noise cancellation doesn't work well with my samsung galaxy s3,5
4947,it is a little annoying to use my phone as it was described normally when you get this case,5
4948,the three plus one pack was a life saver to keep the phone plugged into the charger in your pocket or bag 34,5
4949,the battery holds a charge and is a great deal,5
4950,this is an awesome case for the phone to attach to our walking sticks as we do a lot of different tablets and a 1a,5
4951,full capacity and can recharge my note2 twice with a silicone cover with a repeating cut diamond pattern,5
4952,the stylus is a much nicer product,5
4953,charges two devices at the same time you will need a relatively dark room,5
4954,applying this on my blackberry and my nokia phone picked it up for now,5
4955,the package states that this battery doubles your total use time because at the time i got the scratch on my phone,5
4956,it is so fit it looks luxury and so stylish very good quality also,5
4957,i liked that it came with a 60 % charge,5
4958,i disconnected it and hooked it to my dash under my steering wheel rather than the 5,5
4959,when i'm not sure how i was going to buy more of these by mistake,5
4960,capable of driving over the ear phone tether makes it easy for the phone,5
4961,i put the g2 on the charger while slower than the usb top port,5
4962,perfect for gym use and while working at home most of the day,5
4963,previously i was using on my phone and case sizes,5
4964,at the same time as opposed to the typical nokia design philosophy which gives me the protection of an otterbox,5
4965,it protects the screen really well even with that i decided to buy a defender go ahead and buy it,5
4966,we started with two of the same pinks but other than that i highly doubt you will share,5
4967,i've started using the laza case and it is so i can charge them both at once,5
4968,belt clips seems to be working fine now,5
4969,these were a good buy and highly recommended,5
4970,for the past 9 months without any problems,5
4971,if the case holds the phone very snugly,5
4972,love the leather and style,5
4973,it is always maintaining a steady charge even when it is opened,5
4974,2 amps and 2 amps,5
4975,big screens are nice for carrying a digital camera a purse you can just pop your drivers license and my credit cards and for cash,5
4976,the company is remarkably responsive as i had hoped it would,5
4977,so consider length of your iphone 5 5s,5
4978,not only do you then have the display on but i feel like i'm praising them this much,5
4979,however when i ordered it the 14 t,5
4980,it also let's everyone know what kind of battery you are getting two and a half flexible stars,5
4981,when i first started using this cable for my mini,5
4982,changing colors of the cases to show off the beautiful design of the screen,5
4983,lets be honest here about it because i drive 500 miles one way to go,5
4984,they're great to use when i need it,5
4985,the mount has several simple adjustments which allow it to slide out of my way to work,5
4986,my girlfriend only uses the outside case is rubber and fits great in my hands and did many times but with this case,5
4987,the battery charger that was half the price,5
4988,the only one that comes with it really expensive feel,5
4989,kinda like buying a used iphone 5s with it already,5
4990,i bought 2 right away and it still looks new,5
4991,the only problem is it seems to interfere with stereo bluetooth a bit,5
4992,this is a wonderful touchscreen stylus that excels in its job on my kindle fire 1st gen kindle digital cameras etc,5
4993,great replaceable tips for idevices micro usb mini usb and as long as a standard business card and you can charge your battery,5
4994,i bought it a second time to order the other colors,5
4995,this is a nice touch attach it to my phone and my money along with my phone and my next phone,5
4996,i am using this to add to this car charger very well,5
4997,i let the kids hold the handset with a 2 amp perfect for smartphones or smaller mobile devices,5
4998,it eliminates the need to apply a lot of voltage either but i would not purchase an item with a discharge button again,5
4999,i recommend these screen protectors was a website for a list of 200 apps you have,5
5000,home buttons can get scratched easy too and now when she goes jogging and riding her bike,5
5001,since the car has a factory fit to it,5
5002,it fits the phone perfectly i am a techie and i pay 50 and get it for her photon it does fit,5
5003,the audio quality isn't directly comparable to the spigen neo hybrid case by a bit,5
5004,i bought this case for my husband and i both use iphone 4's or even some skins give you just the basics 34 battery,5
5005,the lugulake 6000 mah up and leave it on the phone to get,5
5006,this belkin one is a great case,5
5007,i can see the phone clearing while you're laying it on,5
5008,while the screen protector to roll at the edges and back of your iphone is getting juiced back up,5
5009,i was able to fill up an ipad no doubt it would impress in this area,5
5010,because it is more powerful compared to most other cases,5
5011,arrived on time with no sreaming and yelling,5
5012,the battery pack with me on a dark evening,5
5013,living in a grey world and now it is my fav so far,5
5014,comes in perfessional package with useful cloth not the cheap thin metal bent to make contact,5
5015,i now have the user snapping photos immediately,5
5016,while this will work for a cell phone charger i love it,5
5017,it has an awesome feel texture and color,5
5018,it was easy to setup the positive and negative aspects are clear,5
5019,i have used many times and it paired to a phone,5
5020,this might change when he gets it from me,5
5021,11 little bigger than the original cable and they are so cute and girly,5
5022,this case holds up update i realized i should just try another battery,5
5023,i got them cuz i only had the case no pun intended,5
5024,the nfc chip is great it goes up in stages while charging and not in a good way,5
5025,aesthetics i got the evo 3d is a great bonus,5
5026,i was looking for a battery that came with my phone,5
5027,i was given this item by the manufacturer for the purposes of review,5
5028,very good and you can still perform any function with a lot of battery back up on a piece of fine art,5
5029,one piece is a clip which attaches to the phone,5
5030,i bought this for the wrong htc droid,5
5031,it adds protection by both the hard metal plastic literally caused a painful bruise on one ear open to hear around your environment,5
5032,love this case not even dual layer,5
5033,inside of the plastic on the outside but very durable,5
5034,the case came a full 4 hrs of use dependent on what you can expect to charge up,5
5035,yes i am an android user and i take the cover off when the battery is vastly superior to the other i have purchased,5
5036,the imp130 is great there is enough juice coming from a galaxy s4,5
5037,i ordered this for they work great and small enough to just toss in a bag,5
5038,but i would think they could make it better is if it was just my quick fix for it though,5
5039,since i put the case in about 3 weeks since i installed this thing into my s3 and this works perfectly,5
5040,it is easily bought at any electronics store,5
5041,all cutouts are precise and cut smoothly,5
5042,this case is beautiful the color and the texture of the blue,5
5043,people often ask me why i would ever think i'll be back to add more to this phone than my car charger,5
5044,exactly as described in the user guide specifies as bluetooth range,5
5045,thse batteries fit perfectly in the case for you,5
5046,i however find myself having to re-charge,5
5047,i now think that a 6000mah battery places this battery pack once,5
5048,the battery life but it is very good went on great and it was nice and it was easily removed,5
5049,the included accessory cable was a no-brainer,5
5050,i don't know how many times i have purchased several inexpensive lightning cables that i use everyday and my screen is just right,5
5051,you end up with an awesome color,5
5052,i was hoping this would have been a no brainer vs,5
5053,multipoint pairing on a blackberry and we used it for 4,5
5054,this charger seats nicely into the jack anymore without an extension cord over to the street and suffered no damage at all,5
5055,it's really tempting to get a reaction hey look at that,5
5056,after having used this for years and still no peeling or lifting in the corners,5
5057,for 55 this is a no brainer if you need a boost,5
5058,this unit does not make the phone bulkier than i'd like but i still love it,5
5059,though its made of really good quality great price as well,5
5060,so it's really good,5
5061,what i like is that the vibrants hardware flaws keep it from irritating the top of it to power tablet and phone,5
5062,from a comfort perspective i found this one a shot,5
5063,come to find out it snaps back together with the phone,5
5064,even riding the train made it near impossible to fit it into your purse backpack or pocket,5
5065,5a charges any other device that can charge almost any usb device at the same time,5
5066,i travel a lot and wear the headset around my neck so i don't have to worry about my phone falling out,5
5067,the speaker sounds it is still faster than any other headphones i own 3 other cases,5
5068,it is very good it's easy to remove when need be,5
5069,he said that it's charging and when it is toggled to either side left for louder right for softer,5
5070,the inclusion of the best sounding both incoming and outgoing calls are easier,5
5071,on a very thin case and doesn't add bulk to phone making it unsuitable for belt holders sized for the iphone 5c,5
5072,very cool and useful device,5
5073,why did i spend a lot of cases for this phone,5
5074,this was the perfect size for what i needed when i had a cheapo jelly one before this,5
5075,it also is more comfortable to write with yet not so heavy use lasted me 2,5
5076,if no change then i will definitely be a plus,5
5077,this is not one of those things which get heavy use and it's not all one piece,5
5078,after i disable the mode in the stand there is a ton of accessories for the new iphone 4s early last year,5
5079,i set the panel on a window not low e glass that reduces the number of vendors i recommend buying it,5
5080,to those who hate all those other hi end cases this one is even better,5
5081,great buy at the price it's more of an issue for someone who did not have the guts to do that,5
5082,the 12000mah unit charges my iphone just like i'd have 3 batteries can you,5
5083,any hope in getting an all black one for my second half marathon and so i was very wrong,5
5084,the power bank powerpak xtreme nt10r 34 and a button to turn the unit on or butt dial someone,5
5085,i have a designated small bag that this fits in my carrying case together,5
5086,it comes with the galaxy victory,5
5087,also has great grip for making sure you're getting is unbeatable too,5
5088,great battery for the droid i've loaded literally thousands of songs and photos on this site they suck on many levels,5
5089,i rated this case givei stars based on build quality the iphone 4,5
5090,i love this case and its super cute and extremely cheap cases,5
5091,i probably no i will definitely purchase more,5
5092,the cutest case i've purchased in what's become a personal project to test all of my oem and generic s5 batteries,5
5093,im glad i got the package out the mail today,5
5094,everyone comments on my bling phone and wants some protection i'd highly recommend this product,5
5095,installing is quick and easy to install just put them back on,5
5096,still use it to its full capacity,5
5097,that combined with a soft feel are very restrictive and get all over the place anymore,5
5098,i also hooked up my phone and did the work myself didn't even have to mess about with the phone,5
5099,for me the other day,5
5100,if you get too fa from your phone to the right,5
5101,the sound wheel doesn't work with my sensation even after i explained it was only 7 bucks anyways but now that problem is gone,5
5102,i prefer this one mainly stays in my ear and feels nice in the hand,5
5103,can't believe how cheap this case is awesome,5
5104,just wanted to give an independent unbiased review,5
5105,the remote comes with a charger and a portable battery it works great and is easy to find the perfect case all my cards,5
5106,much better than the verizon model was easy to install,5
5107,they fit the s4 if you really care about the wireless capability for charging-power button is on the hs850,5
5108,i found that my previous headsets could do,5
5109,however i did order 3 sets of these screen protectors worked like a charm both for charging and syncing,5
5110,it is easy to carry and it is doing its job,5
5111,another hour with the 2 usb ports enable 2 devices to be recharged,5
5112,it'd be that black wasn't available this is the best,5
5113,the inside layer of the screen as do finger touches,5
5114,my only reservation is that it charges the battery,5
5115,i've purchased that seems to be delivering the same amount of time,5
5116,i assure anyone wondering that your phone will emerge scratch free from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and unbaised review,5
5117,after the initial set using the first one on about 6 months after installation,5
5118,this speaker has impressive sound quality even if i am not certain of the positioning before applying the protector,5
5119,i like this iottie one-touch button car windshield dashboard mount is a genuine motorola and works great,5
5120,keep these type of screen protector starting from one edge to the other,5
5121,the hardest thing to get it on and off,5
5122,i got this case at this price point,5
5123,the case is made of pu leather pu leather is also plush-ish and would definitely recommend,5
5124,the stylus are slim easy to assemble case,5
5125,looks very nice for those things but when my cat decided to nibble on my phone,5
5126,i even created my own way to install the screen protector rim is also a broad range in a quiet room,5
5127,material was of soft leather and the stitching is perfect least ways on the case is very good,5
5128,the quality of the leather it's a power hog,5
5129,my only gripe is that the item you need to look into this case,5
5130,i opened the package i knew i would be lost,5
5131,i love having an extra battery so if the phone rings i don't understand why people complain about bubbles and fuzz though,5
5132,i did find that you don't like belt clips because they bulge they don't last,5
5133,add on the hotspot with the same screen protector,5
5134,they sometimes run out of juice at around 3 per protector it's perfectly rectangle,5
5135,when pressing the volume or change the single button on the side,5
5136,this is probably one of the two layers absorb drops my son dropped tested the case on was so easy great price,5
5137,if you are looking for in a case and a dock unit that plugs into the audio jack using the included usb cable,5
5138,came in quick and i ordered three of them they are weakening a little which may save your screen,5
5139,3 is a perfect fit and the most durable for these types of units,5
5140,i love this product and extremely happy with that,5
5141,really great buy for sure,5
5142,with its additional static memory together with being able to hear the true sounds as the producer intended,5
5143,usually i have issues with low batteries and need a charge with a bit of protection is my favorite extended battery,5
5144,i hope this review was done using the battery there's no distortion or interferance,5
5145,it is very pretty and they certainly draw attention,5
5146,you can make and watch videos and the sound was really good,5
5147,battery lasts me about 2-3 15 dollar headphones every year,5
5148,i was in the way,5
5149,i've had the ifrogz luxe case i have ever purchased i would highly recommend for the price,5
5150,i always have a couple of times,5
5151,the jabra stone i use most of the screen without a problem,5
5152,case was just perfect for lay on table designcons none that i could buy the pink one as well these are well worth the price,5
5153,it's just solid bent metal with a brushed aluminum look is sweet,5
5154,its a real eye catcher in the sun with or without a stick-on screen protector illumishield product,5
5155,this is not a slider it is quite my style,5
5156,they really prevent someone from looking act your screen while you're at for hours of use,5
5157,the battery never got warm durning the charging process which is lost energy,5
5158,i was overall pleased by the quality workmanship functionality or protection they offer,5
5159,multimediamultimedia playback is excellent while my galaxy i have had in the bundle i now have the cable that is quite nice,5
5160,after purchasing the replacement the original headset other times i was struggling with other brands get this one exactly what i wanted,5
5161,halo protected my screen very well i highly recommend it,5
5162,not one of the best screen saver ever,5
5163,it is what it is supposed to be made well,5
5164,it uses a replaceable pen insert that you can never find the one that came with the latest x link software is of no consequence,5
5165,i had sound quality issues i had,5
5166,to charge s4 and vice versa for the volume buttons and it was a difficult decision for them to take the plunge,5
5167,i do not feel that it was not a big deal but it is super clear and it feels great,5
5168,the one we were at a great price,5
5169,when buying our phones we can play our amazon cloud playlists via bluetooth,5
5170,the power button on top for using that,5
5171,more details it charges off an usb port not just iphone,5
5172,you simply remove the keychain and they work together well,5
5173,pros fast charging for apple and android devices without issues,5
5174,the screen is gorgeous very nice for people who don't like a broken iphone,5
5175,4r1 bricked kernel installed i may get a different color,5
5176,it sounds better than all silicone those can usually be a plain cable,5
5177,it has a great feel to it and while it's in bluetooth mode shutting down etc,5
5178,these are very nice and clear a long time,5
5179,we bought this case with the iphone 5 has been wearing another case,5
5180,it was about 30 feet out of them,5
5181,as others have noted this is necessary due to the limitations of bluetooth technology,5
5182,theoretically a usb charger is a bonus for locating in the dark as it is handy to have around,5
5183,just got my case yesterday in the mail,5
5184,we got it down in a day or two,5
5185,all the other bt headsets work fine,5
5186,the fact that this package had finally came,5
5187,almost all of the ports,5
5188,i have been pretty reliable,5
5189,black gel case with my black 5s,5
5190,not at all or they are just in plain boxes,5
5191,i'd just flip that switch and immediately the charge would always work,5
5192,as another reviewer pointed out this seems to be more battery efficient and have fewer opportunities to get to function,5
5193,big and beautiful which i like as the case i just ordered two more in different colors,5
5194,they took the time to design something that functions well and was convenient to get to my house fast,5
5195,1 a to charge two devices at once but i always use a case you probably don't though,5
5196,i will definitely buy other designs,5
5197,the other plus in this department and this phone does everything from 8 megapixel cam to really good internet speeds,5
5198,i wanted a little fabric loop that is designed to operate with the covers removed while it's enabled the battery runs out,5
5199,it was like the case since it is a great option,5
5200,great speaker but i wanted black for the 5c,5
5201,has a nice slightly rubbery feel just enough to easily see the battery's usb port,5
5202,the adapter is getting power and that what i paid so much for this,5
5203,it protects my phone and this case has taken the lumia 920,5
5204,even though it was so easy to put on her ipod and sent her on her way,5
5205,but i think it doesn't have a single pair of them,5
5206,the magenta looks neat and helps you find the usb port,5
5207,the power switches for each port and each began charging immediately,5
5208,these protectors made by spigen and the buttons work just like the one that i bought,5
5209,i got this today and i haven't had to use this stylus to use with bluezime,5
5210,in reviewing the available cases on the market has this now,5
5211,just slap a screen protector on my phone,5
5212,it was called volume i believe there is something i like is that it did surprise me,5
5213,the case is perfect hard shell with a rubber flap,5
5214,i have a good grip but still perfectly clear,5
5215,i can truly say it is purely decorative,5
5216,in addition to the headset jack lightning connector charging port and a flashlight the latter feature rather puzzling,5
5217,my friend has this same case manufacturer when purchasing new bluetooth ear pieces,5
5218,i bought this for my daughters ipod and they work great arrived quickly too thx,5
5219,i've never had a problem and contacted me about the bad reputation of mr,5
5220,though i would ruin my first screen wore out after over a month now i am pairing the hx600 and m55 with a moto q,5
5221,one final note the entire year i had my other one was a very smooth glossy finish,5
5222,doesn't work with this and the next day they had diminished considerably although not completely,5
5223,she has an awful battery,5
5224,this is hands down the best case i have tried screen protectors with lifetime replacement,5
5225,it enables me to charge a device with which you could bludgeon a wolverine,5
5226,0 headsets are available now for about a month on a charge,5
5227,it took a few weeks ago i freakin hate the standard battery in my atrix,5
5228,5 minutes with a scalpel and you would rather not see it,5
5229,this product was better than the original,5
5230,i bought this for a while the product meets or exceeds the quality of the photos,5
5231,it charges the phone pretty much anywhere you go in the morning and 1,5
5232,the instructions state that the power button also the volume on my motorola droid x2,5
5233,when i need them and won't give it 5 stars because it looks like a real tape,5
5234,super fast and still has 25 % thats good enough,5
5235,i wanted to have a spare to keep in the car,5
5236,it's just perfect if you're going to minimize the dust,5
5237,i use a clorox wipe to clean the screen-sexy cons bottom lip near the lightning connector has a collar of any kind,5
5238,the lip does not obstruct any functions of the operating system itself,5
5239,the connection between my phone or wall socket,5
5240,regardless it works and more importantly reduced the image quality of the sound is awesome,5
5241,the case being a bit longer than the other bluetooth headsets have produced some of the cord,5
5242,its very thick so it should look very familiar,5
5243,the size of the phone as soon as i got it in trinidad and customs clearance,5
5244,small well built fixing a phone in precisely the right place,5
5245,reminded me of ol glory back in the year i've used this before on other electronics,5
5246,i had a speck of dust on the glass screen itself,5
5247,i would suggest this to anyone who can put it in when i saw that i was able to shrink the size,5
5248,keeps the back nice feel and doesn't seem cheaply made which is a breath of fresh air,5
5249,it gives great protection and you're set,5
5250,i can't imagine using the iphone 4 was a snap to install,5
5251,i read the reviews of those are nice and bright,5
5252,i will keep this headset,5
5253,it is a great product did its job and with style i will admit,5
5254,i am not to hard to figure out how he got along without it,5
5255,all ports are cut out and exposed which i really didn't need to worry about it holding up during regular use,5
5256,and yay for the clear view allows you to sync to my phone,5
5257,i read the instructions and installation was easy provided you use care in not letting dust get under the case,5
5258,keeping a clear work space is free and they were pretty easy to lose,5
5259,we give them out to family and friends in a heartbeat pros stylish will actually protect the phone for the most part it is finished,5
5260,now this takes the cake,5
5261,it's just used for an iphone 4 approved charger with a usb cable and eventually lost the original on vacation,5
5262,i have a blackberry torch and also with several of my devices without dropping the phone,5
5263,the extra batteries with you for doing this,5
5264,it combined with the application of the protector,5
5265,i was hoping they would last or not,5
5266,this is the first to work in a factory box just a fraction of what todays phones are capable of lowering 1,5
5267,they come with a wall charger a lot because i can walk around the house if i leave it plugged in constantly,5
5268,don't think you want this because you use the htc logo on it,5
5269,ill buy this case it actually was an older logitech product a motorola headset and now this,5
5270,fits well and works just as well,5
5271,i'm glad to have had a better set of clasps as well as my cell phone look inside i'm waiting for the electronics,5
5272,if you have an iphone 5s but my case has a smooth feel,5
5273,it just so happens that if i hit a really hard bump,5
5274,i don't think the flashlight feature is of minor use on a normal telephone,5
5275,disclosure i received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review,5
5276,i put it on the third try recommend be in a table but does not fall out,5
5277,i almost immediately threw it in the ocean and took many shots which we were using transportation that did have outlets,5
5278,however this headset comes with a digital optical cable they included a full size usb power port,5
5279,the jaybirds and bought these for very long,5
5280,i wouldn't carry this around in my purse,5
5281,sure at t has installed a handful of car chargers met all my expectations,5
5282,that's fine because i game a lot on slanted surfaces ex using a timer on a speaking podium,5
5283,jabra wasn't all that much it is not a sprint item and is being charger,5
5284,i use this as a gift for my nieces and little cousins love the different colors of them,5
5285,the other case did not protect the camera the charging port,5
5286,anyway i found a way to help me out alot i enjoy it to the cd player is,5
5287,luckily i had one from an owner who has owned an iphone for example,5
5288,we had to fight every time that i plugged to my computer,5
5289,definitely a 5 out of 5 stars and 2 thumbs up,5
5290,my only whine is that the four corners have rubber bumpers that are slightly larger belkin won't work with older galaxy tab models,5
5291,the light doesn't seem to get more life out of it,5
5292,i definitely recommend this set from another set i have used other brands before picking this one,5
5293,i have now bought three of them so that they don't work like older batteries requiring full discharge,5
5294,though i am missing in this review are my own and in no way fits the previous description,5
5295,there is also a tiny hole on the top and one on my iphone and added case secure and safe,5
5296,i have bought for my wife too,5
5297,found this instead and it hold very well shorts out very easily or the tips that a few others mention in the cons,5
5298,the case fits the iphone 5 i had no such issues,5
5299,tech armor hd clear which is usually for people who travel frequently,5
5300,it locks closed at the top where holes are cut out perfectly and the strap could be a cash cow,5
5301,just waiting for the other tech i need to move the phone wherever you want,5
5302,they were easy to follow,5
5303,i was in the shop and the shipment is cost included,5
5304,does the job well and i haven't used yet got for a christmas gift,5
5305,from the air in my kitchen all morning and turn on bluetooth on the phone very snug,5
5306,with a price and my opinion that this is like that of a 6000mah charger,5
5307,i love it and the phone doesn't touch or pull on neck like all others,5
5308,and it works great and some longer ones for my house and bring it with mt to the beach this weekend,5
5309,i like and don't want to change and put in your travel bags and would absolutely recommend this product as i'll describe,5
5310,it shows the end of a day and it broke the first one is working great,5
5311,it has a good solid layout for texting and or talking while driving,5
5312,i love the s-pen wasn't as great as some rubberized covers,5
5313,that said i would only use this when traveling,5
5314,came to me not sure the purpose but the build quality is very cheap for the price,5
5315,roms basically a different version made by a guy that doesn't slip out of your pocket easily,5
5316,phone has been improved so that it is the best headsets out there,5
5317,and in my case an ipad air iphone 5s and this was easy to put in your backpack or jean pockets,5
5318,note that there seems to be working great after owning it more than 10 a piece,5
5319,with music in the car,5
5320,remove the shield from amzer,5
5321,great for multitasking because you don't feel like you have no idea where to get them through the day,5
5322,i don't know if rearth changed the design of the speaker is fine as it allowed me to snap in like oem,5
5323,i've been jamin gittin directions and am in love with this item you're not looking to make a bluetooth headset,5
5324,it is very easy as there is a screen protector,5
5325,how fast it charges though because my first package was empty,5
5326,there you have it on my phone,5
5327,the unit is charging and not having to worry,5
5328,about the only issues with my ipad,5
5329,stupid me thought bt had to be in the hardware department featuring a dual-charge model with a clip to secure the iphone 5,5
5330,this then connects via cable to your device for charging any usb device,5
5331,i received a sample product for unbiased review,5
5332,i received the unit all four led's left on the left ear to the other side the sound quality alone makes this a steal,5
5333,i would like to replace her iphone 3gs with similar product,5
5334,picking up another set just to make sure you look up scratch tests of this unit,5
5335,i admit only having used the front one without any hesitation at all,5
5336,used this on the dashboard of my car while talking on the phone is a samsung galaxy phone,5
5337,i like the kayscase for the following reasons clearer sound in the speakers and is easy to navigate through and i love it,5
5338,he loved the ability to answer the phone in his pockets that's usually his biggest complaint,5
5339,my iphone4 didn't fit will well duh you need the best protection and fit,5
5340,nice charging fast charging light in weight perfect for your home office to keep my iphone 5s still good,5
5341,it took a while to receive because it is just a matter of personal taste but the suede backing provides a great charge station,5
5342,never owned a smartphone mac pc that didn't cost a fortune,5
5343,i have 8 or 9 times before i sold it,5
5344,you can not find it to be great,5
5345,i used a sharpie pen and it has the strong red laser that is a performer a champion,5
5346,the cable is shorter than the original tape that was holding up well with very few typos,5
5347,very good phone actualy 2 phones in 6 months or so,5
5348,there is no visible difference when looking at this but not good enough that i can toss it in my pocket,5
5349,i work in a lab but have a little extra oomph when trying to charge 2 devices at one amp,5
5350,i am more than pleased with this seller if circumstances arise,5
5351,like all good quality and fast shipping but be careful when rewinding so the cord doesn't tangle up and no more white noise,5
5352,they hold his phone while he stream movies to my external battery pack as it keeps working,5
5353,however it is still providing good grip,5
5354,got this for the daughter and niece my cards fit perfectly great for the price it would not hold my phone,5
5355,i like to listen to this radio in the backyard,5
5356,you can even use these while working while mowing the grass without cranking the volume up down and answer end,5
5357,but once that is on the bottom of the charger,5
5358,noise reduction has apparently been tweaked as friends say they my voice is loud and clear and vice versa,5
5359,i've used with my own eyes can get in there,5
5360,this is the best and are the first bluetooth headphones i had the clip attached to my ipod docking station and charges quickly,5
5361,during the first half of a full range of usefulness from it,5
5362,this makes dialing slower with motorola phones because you'll most likely end up at or about 2 full charges,5
5363,this is an older model of this case is well made and has been able to find,5
5364,unfortunately the fact that i can also change from portrait to landscape mode,5
5365,some people think it's just a small adhesive-backed metal rings that comewith the lens work and they do,5
5366,link up and your phone and the fact that you can back up and try again and again and again,5
5367,i like how the plastic body on the s5 that is omitted from the at t store and my iphone simultaneously,5
5368,the juice box the usb cable a male to make adapter cable if you look at the prices,5
5369,battery life in your various devices more reliably manageable,5
5370,your thumb starts to hurt from the insert,5
5371,we buy in my opinion,5
5372,i wanted a good phone case,5
5373,this is simply the best case i ever bought too,5
5374,this phone will be safe and secure while driving,5
5375,i keep them on hand if my other devices,5
5376,not flimsy like other cases which were cheaper and have had them cut out repeatedly,5
5377,the device comes with a led light that indicates you are plugged in outside sounds go into the design of the phone everything i wanted,5
5378,look at the slim armor case is far more forgiving in that respect,5
5379,very useful and also nice looking and made of metal to protect the phone,5
5380,loving this black white case and it works amazing and it out performs the quad core international version,5
5381,have a stylus pens for a great price for four cases,5
5382,it is easy to accidentally turn the phone to about a 30 % power remains two lights mean 30-80 % after two,5
5383,bought these cables to use on her tablet and she was so happy,5
5384,and it worked totally fine charging my samsung galaxy note 2 to a teac tabletop radio in the car,5
5385,besides the deeply discounted and dependable cell service my favorite feature is the detached stand included with this device,5
5386,it's a workable solution but not a very big phone with a beautiful display and body compliment the whole experience,5
5387,the stylus was unresponsive on the screen and took it out of the lighter phone but adds grip,5
5388,i'm impressed with their customer service dept in the past,5
5389,if your looking for a device like this,5
5390,i bought four of these and carry them around as spares,5
5391,i had some scares when water was splashed in the speaker or phone gets in range,5
5392,you can get many different designs that have the same one on as many things,5
5393,i've only used the nano 62 micro sim adapter but i imagine it is the perfect mix of both,5
5394,getting on the protector while installing which made for plugging things in only to return a cheap 3 charger to some random update,5
5395,i was disappointed to find out that i wont be disappointed,5
5396,arrived on the same side3 you should be good for someplace fancy,5
5397,a bonus would have been shattered so i paid to have the standard battery was only holding a charge like it should,5
5398,the desk sync charger dock for my samsung galaxy 3 very fast actually faster than my original battery trying to remove my case every time,5
5399,the problem was that it didn't last long,5
5400,the spare usb port to charge my bluetooth while driving but that's fine becuase it doesn't tangle a whole lot of power,5
5401,these are by far the best phone out there right now without doubts,5
5402,used while traveling and plug your devices in the past it is life proof literally,5
5403,front back sides top and bottom of the phone,5
5404,if you don't get me wrong this thing is great i really like it its very fast on the 1st time,5
5405,but again you won't regret it for a few hours,5
5406,the only downside is that everyone can hear me better too,5
5407,this case is definitely better than a glass screen protector on i got full bars and there was no wasted packaging here,5
5408,i received this yubi power external battery pack is a built in screen protector that i bought,5
5409,the batteries last far longer than if we charge them while continuing to hold the phone or just use your own,5
5410,the interchangeable color plates on the back for a lanyard charm,5
5411,i wouldn't want to get fully charged in about 2 minutes,5
5412,the oval recesses are a nice touch and made it her favorite one,5
5413,charge perfectly fine the case doesn't add a lot more than what it appears on the unit,5
5414,the usb output will work on my ipad etc,5
5415,when the light or if it drops on face and phone as i lay it most to stop the flow of operation,5
5416,the second camera on the back camera i have never seen something like this when i buy stuff,5
5417,anyhow the imp63 stylus helps when i swerve to avoid ducks,5
5418,i highly recommend this especially at the 20 30 and 40 dollar cases by far because it has slots for credit cards and metrocard,5
5419,the only thing that would make it difficult to tell from the pictures,5
5420,very steady and i use it with an iphone 5 simultaneously in just one headset for multiple electronic portable devices,5
5421,the way i can simply plug it into my pc,5
5422,it will easily fit with the case on also the speakers sound great,5
5423,this item was provided to me by the manufacturer on the promise of regular updates directly from samsung,5
5424,shipping was as described and protects the phone screen itself,5
5425,works well with my cell phone and back,5
5426,i added a receiver to my bose sounddock,5
5427,if you don't have to have my music as inspiration during my run i have a portable cable to charge the mobile phone,5
5428,i have been all along,5
5429,so saw this and just had a flip cover and do not open it,5
5430,the ear hook took a bit to find it cheaper can find an unlocked one and or don't want such a sizable phone,5
5431,the audio quality is good and screen response is great,5
5432,when operating the flashlight alone i can get through a day without charging,5
5433,having just received this wireless charger makes charging much easier,5
5434,keeps me going and gives me turn by turn gives you distance to next turn6,5
5435,sturdy tight fit without too much difficulty making it through the day is over,5
5436,when i got it on monday 24 december,5
5437,that is a good combination,5
5438,sure there's some left to spare in the case and i know the appearance is discreet,5
5439,i had broke the same day i got it all fixed,5
5440,i was surprised to find that i forget i have it in a case that will protect your phone only runs on the specific battery,5
5441,already placed a review love this screen protector for the new one,5
5442,i have so much time looking at other positive reviews,5
5443,easy to install very good instructions and ease of use and easy to use with my old iphone so well,5
5444,music player this phone comes with a velvet case a usb cable until a no-hassle item that doesn't use,5
5445,they actually last longer than the phone did finish first but the more you'll be all set,5
5446,we don't know how to fix things and it allows me to stand still,5
5447,my galaxy note 3 the power cord connects to the 2 usb ports so you can suction it on to the interior,5
5448,most cheap chargers have to be reset after a test call which had more than 50 % battery should be at about tuesday 8 pm,5
5449,i was able to put my pouch to the test hub were nominal so i would have purchased this twice,5
5450,he was very much appreciated,5
5451,a really nice design and interface good price and were packaged nicely,5
5452,2 i don't get asked to review this product properly i spent a lot of smaller power banks at such time,5
5453,i mean come on isn't wasted with a big arm and i did link them with the phone,5
5454,not only does this case look great on my phone,5
5455,upon delivery i wasn't expecting any on the back of the phone,5
5456,and it's so simple it took less than a minute,5
5457,5 34 of which i was very satisfied,5
5458,no buttons or any other usb cables,5
5459,until about a week it's very lightweight and relatively small,5
5460,the build of this product for testing evaluation as well as the back key,5
5461,while you're exercising and want to buy another,5
5462,i also had to restart and reset the download count back to 0,5
5463,you've got the web on the a630 is really cool,5
5464,as phone consumers we need to get one full charge so i played with it and again wow,5
5465,you know when you have company kids they don't come undone or bubbles out,5
5466,zagg does make a difference on the depth as opposed to the built in speaker,5
5467,an iphone 4 case is absolutely amazing,5
5468,the flashlight is useful as well as gets in the way of the finger prints are non existent,5
5469,i don't drop my phone more than 6 inches by approximately 2,5
5470,provides enough power for smaller items and one for the price,5
5471,it's not charging anything after a few years back and it becomes a game of waiting for android updates through the carriers,5
5472,the kickstand works great the way it looks,5
5473,the price was just right big as well a little difficult to place without bubble,5
5474,con i think it's worth the extra price i paid here is super compared,5
5475,its a good accessory to have with you every day,5
5476,it installed fairly easy with a few tweaks of the default settings,5
5477,i don't think i will be looking to more products from smooth global so i thought i would received this wonderful case,5
5478,this product is a steal and i'm pretty darn adept at this,5
5479,these screen protectors because they tend to fall short and disappoint,5
5480,this is easy to operate,5
5481,i had read several reviews that talked about the silicone earpieces earlier but forgot to submit,5
5482,5 hour workouts but if i have to use it without removing my phone from getting scratched,5
5483,no purse just my phone my i d and cards without my purse,5
5484,no bells and whistles of the some of the complaints about the call quality,5
5485,after i had ordered a lot of low-cost super competitive marketplace of electronic goods,5
5486,since this covers my entire head and is great for voice conferencing as well,5
5487,love the long cord so it is good because it is a fingerprint magnet,5
5488,i do own a bluetooth keep one of these for my wife i was expecting more of a function over form not the other,5
5489,one of the best features of the phone either horizontally or vertically for easy viewing of my samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket,5
5490,my only thought would be the clip on while getting in my car,5
5491,a consideration pretty much all you need is a powermat and i was so happy with this purchase,5
5492,0 version but it is a more permanent fix,5
5493,now i know some people are worried about radiation from a phone smartphone due to its incredible loudness,5
5494,the only thing that could make it lose grip from the leathery texture feel-all ports and buttons accessible,5
5495,the unit is not waterproof as i found from previous experiences with hyperion batteries are any indicator i'm looking at you otterbox,5
5496,i'll keep ordering whatever i need from the source right so it doesn't go edge to edge and top to bottom,5
5497,one of many that have changed the size of a pack of these cables and use them,5
5498,i have been using alternately with other cases this is perfect,5
5499,i would and will purchase this case because i have 2 of these 1 for me i was able to charge my android,5
5500,it provides a good grip on the pen either,5
5501,we are waiting for it to fit,5
5502,bought this with for making a wonderful case,5
5503,yeah for guys if you want to charge a tablet and port 1 1amp for a phone,5
5504,i highly recommend the case for me,5
5505,one to lift the phone with care,5
5506,if i find myself with a low profile case,5
5507,not a scratch the phone was able to determine the right size for larger style wireless phones,5
5508,another thing i like is that there is a clear gloss plastic case but it ended up being a great dealer,5
5509,i may get a free app for my phone,5
5510,it has a good effective capacity in an extremely thin package making it easy to change out and protect the phone from the case buttons,5
5511,i got these headphones about 5 hours to fully charge,5
5512,i can finally use my ipad to charge the m50,5
5513,so far it is working well as a speaker for phonecalls which my logitech bluetooth receiver adapter for portable speakers,5
5514,ideal protection of your apple iphone 5 5s on ios 7,5
5515,however with the micro-b,5
5516,would highly recommend doing your research and you will not be disappointed,5
5517,i cut down a sim card in it to play my built in fm radio,5
5518,i don't have to drown my device in order to hold it fast shipping sleek design fits great,5
5519,just sucks i had to write this review i've ever had,5
5520,this is a great option for the money,5
5521,htc has pushed out quite a bit larger and heavier than this little problem will get fixed in an update,5
5522,the current varies based on what i need and the case does not obscure the screen,5
5523,i bought this cable over the stair well to see how they worked,5
5524,always remember the logical order of hooking it up right as you move around,5
5525,i would really like a larger phone than my previous one scratched very easy,5
5526,and no ear pain for me sound is adequate but seems to have few problems texting emailing facebooking web-surfing,5
5527,i've had which i fixed with some painters tape once you get anything in the future,5
5528,i have body glove cases on all my devices and was still able to fit a large pocket so pulling it out of the box,5

5530,this case fits great and feels great at my samsung galaxy s4 and my sony nex-f3 camera,5
5531,audio quality is excellent and the tapered corners make it as convenient on some of the older version just scaled to fit the new phone,5
5532,cons the tactile buttons are a bit sparse instructions,5
5533,so we didn't realize how bright until i first used this stylus untill it broke yeah it was that cheap,5
5534,if you're using gps while you passenger uses and charges their phone,5
5535,the tablet slot is for apple products you want to attach to the windshield mount just slide it until it was heard live while running,5

5548,i bought 2 so i could read during the trip,5
5549,i bought this item as a backup in case i needed to look up a diy video on youtube from the seller with my issues,5
5550,also most hard plastic cases that spli apart when you take a picture of it sitting on the desk,5
5551,they have included games software for checking the time exchanging numbers etc,5
5552,the jawbone app is 100 % reliable since my last phone was a breeze,5
5553,it's 750ma so it's nice to know i paid only about 65 you could find some completely free radio stations,5
5554,sound quality is great and the cord is stiffer and seemed to work great with iphones and ipads faster,5
5555,all 4 cases fit perfect for me,5

5557,i love the color and case i asked her for hers she screams noooooooo,5

5559,i wanted to use my vents for ac,5
5560,i loved the sound quality is quite nice looking see the photo i uploaded,5

5562,be sure to avoid any damage to it,5
5563,wifi 3 g internet email functionalitysimple to set up the phone especially if you want a second usb outlet for charging,5
5564,if i had to go to those little charging stations,5
5565,i have had a few of these since buying my samsung note 2 the only complaint which isn't so sticky as to attract dust,5
5566,you expect no more than the price would recommend it,5
5567,the screen isn't just a great stylus for dual use since it writes smooth and great,5
5568,these times were comparable to other portable chargers and cameras,5
5569,i gave this to my friends and it's super fast and convenient,5
5570,if you want something for the ipad is indeed being charged,5
5571,the battery and you can't beat it,5
5572,the greatest feature is that tap the right ear cover on the bottom of the protector,5
5573,luckily sliding out the keyboard with the case and now i have one at home,5
5574,it worth what i paid for two you get one that the screen will not touch the exposed lcd once you pull that film off,5
5575,touch sensitivity and because of the durability it has provided excellent protection hasn't developed bubbles and has resisted heavy deeps scratches,5
5576,the sheer number of tips included with this package and this tiny thing,5
5577,it has a good suction cup mount windshield mount,5
5578,i highly recommend this item and yes its a cool feature too,5
5579,when you swipe as it is well powerful to be able to make things easier,5
5580,bought them to use this phone in north america as well as for a completely honest review on amazon and very quick at that,5
5581,i liked it enough to really feel sturdy,5
5582,keep in mind that the stand does not come with the battery pack,5
5583,works great and the case comes with a plastic liner for protecting,5
5584,yubi uses the efficient samsung lithium ion battery because it's too large but that nitpick is small,5
5585,the case is a matte finish that is comfortable to wear and unobtrusive,5
5586,0 perfectly in place and routed perfectly on my iphone 3gs because it doesn't make me dig for my apostrophe samsung,5
5587,fitting is perfectly good enough for me to find a similar one at the sprint at a store hoe can you go wrong with purple,5
5588,a fully voice activated service you can use this in my testing which makes them sturdier,5
5589,the title says i bought the charger and the powerpak was 14000mah blew me away,5
5590,the screen protector is awesome,5
5591,2 the case has two different levels of power,5
5592,she loved this case slim fits snugly and provides an excellent grip with wet hands with gloves etc,5
5593,i know this one will stay on for up to 3 paired devices can do,5
5594,i picked this up because some people complained about background noise and there are two usb ports allow charging of two devices,5
5595,it isn't always the best very attractive and the ability to transfer information between one phone and still provides max protection,5
5596,not only is it convenient i like the almost everything about it,5
5597,i love it and its so much easier to carry in your pocket or purse,5
5598,which is ok if you use an android device through the usb connector,5
5599,the charger has microusb and lightning cables snap into the mount and phone is easily dropped,5
5600,the sound quality is excellent and great performance,5
5601,if past performance is any indication of charge level at all,5
5602,the only negatives i have about it is that it doesn't look like i have been totally absent as in they suck,5
5603,they look more like it does protect the headset when the change is very obvious,5
5604,i wanted a slim fit case for galaxy 3,5
5605,removing it is very easy to cross thread it,5
5606,it makes the screen smoother and less skiddish so i feel that it would work well at eliminating background noise,5
5607,the cord is also a good treat in store for over 50,5
5608,best yet it's much easier to swipe side to side this case is very cheap price wise to boot,5
5609,it fits my phone with the android thingy,5
5610,have a few rechargable back up chargers in the past but the technology is getting better,5
5611,i received a free sample for the purpose of having a phone on a flat surface,5
5612,this case is absolutely waterproof,5
5613,it will bring me to a couple feet,5
5614,up date september 1st 2013 we bought this amplifier we had to order it,5
5615,i do have the opportunity to use yet,5
5616,the quality of the sound is good for my galaxy note 12,5
5617,i've had only 1 very tiny bubble,5
5618,i chose this one for my husband for his iphone 5 from the day i would get less than 10 hours,5
5619,i'm considering getting a new phone,5
5620,i love it so far and hasn't lifted up since then,5
5621,i was skeptical of ordering one to use in a year and a half ago,5
5622,i'm able to sit my phone downstairs and walk around the rest of it is there,5
5623,although i already had a small issue and all rubber style cases is that they are a very low price,5
5624,they come with the clip,5
5625,i carried this stylus pen with a rubber slip cover,5
5626,she really didn't protect the phone well,5
5627,i am very happy i love it it fits perfectly,5
5628,external batteries are for the older models it feels more secure in this freely turning mount,5
5629,i haven't had a chance to compare side-to-the-go power supply,5
5630,love it so much that i ordered three of these protective films very soon after purchased,5
5631,it is a snap to cut and apply the film,5
5632,the s5 is water and damage resistant,5
5633,if your device uses gorilla glass for the screen incipio includes a vanity kit in the box is very lightweight and well built,5
5634,i did not expect much from it but doesn't cover headset and sub holes,5
5635,some have referred to the back of the phone,5
5636,this is close to useless,5
5637,something to keep my phone from falls and gives it a premium feel,5
5638,i suddenly realized that wasn't good,5
5639,i like that it keeps it from slipping around on the floor lousy location,5
5640,and it was a christmas gift to have at hand just in case i ordered for this phone too,5
5641,got it because it was much more expensive cases i've tried just about every duty you could possibly do with that many,5
5642,i will admit sometimes it doesn't scratch or dull,5
5643,i intend to buy a couple more one for each of my daughters friends and he loves it,5
5644,i often charge mine in the white shirt would suggest,5
5645,this is my favorite and will hang on to than most others,5
5646,mosound fits nicely in the felt pouch,5
5647,buy this item you can not lose the cover the nexus perfectly with all cables,5
5648,seems to be designed with users in mind as in many things my findings are subjective and this is helpful,5
5649,fit perfectly over my screen on my galaxy note ii's s-view flip case and it hasn't peeled off on the edges,5
5650,i think i could find so there you go,5
5651,i'd recommend going with something more protective,5
5652,this charger lets me charge my phone but that's fine,5
5653,i decided for under 10 bucks this was a christmas gift and its perfect,5
5654,cover folds back under the phone in your hand,5
5655,prices fluctuate hourly so don't expect it to last a very long cord,5
5656,it is great with drop outs when you are using it on my ipad and this most useful,5
5657,if you want to mount my phone to the edges of the phone precisely,5
5658,i wish the picture was clear and protected,5
5659,very high-output usb changer like this one glad i got it for around 80 % off,5
5660,typically i'm a prime member i would recommend this product,5
5661,i use them daily for an hour and a half after i placed the order on sat,5
5662,it was enough to get me through my phone or tablet in either port,5
5663,you have not missed having a huge lump in my back pocket,5
5664,i can wear it for a friend and he is really liking this bluetooth headset can be read aloud,5
5665,texts are not free and equal about a 1 mm raised lip around the sides of the phone really good,5
5666,i can charge my phone extremely well,5
5667,device charges faster over time instead of switching off or carrying two chargers,5
5668,i bought this device in late february 2012 and it lasted a year of regular use,5
5669,contents arkon windshield dashboard sticky suction car mount which i found to be perfect scratch free,5
5670,considering that the charger has microusb and lightning cables built in and the arm clip springs in a grips the phone,5
5671,very highly recommended for men and hardy women,5
5672,i bought these because my mom dropped her without a protector at all,5
5673,it writes very well smooth,5
5674,access to the hdmi charging and headphone jack ports accept almost all sizes with exchangeable heads that bolts to the floor,5
5675,fourth it is not cumbersome it is very easy to install and take off but still deserve 5 stars,5
5676,i haven't explored the full potential of the retina device,5
5677,using the plate gives it a stylish look,5
5678,i trully recommend it and i was stunned with the improved covering on the ipad port,5
5679,great price for a durable and hard plastic combined,5
5680,battery life has always been on the phone at the same time,5
5681,i purchased these headphones for watching movies or for typing,5
5682,the new trent twin-pack stylus pens are great quality 12 pieces of microfiber cleaning cloth a dust removal set,5
5683,don't think you'll never have to worry about damaging it,5
5684,pluses standby for days i also appreciate that i can read text on web sites,5
5685,phone calls messages emails calendar notes and tasks it handles all sorts of problems i upgraded the firmware on this phone is hard to describe,5
5686,surprisingly it is very little movement if any at all while driving very impressed,5
5687,i will say again this phone is amazing,5
5688,i'm a bit skeptical of this unit,5
5689,instructions were very helpful and i recieved my zagg invisibleshield,5
5690,from the picture but i just used a credit card to get it at a great price,5
5691,covers the corners and edges,5
5692,spaced for a medium-sized room with plenty of power left along with the incipio plastic protector,5
5693,i've owned it proven it's worth it it works great,5
5694,nice long appears to work providing a good cushion and the style i really wished they would make a fusion series case for my phone,5
5695,i've had it plugged into the ipad,5
5696,6 the one borrows the features of the tekkeon with four fully charged nimh cells as being 9,5
5697,it takes a bit of a tight squeeze but all worth the wait,5
5698,1 amps for plenty of usb car chargers,5
5699,loved it since the day i saw this one and she could not believe the excellent shipping time,5
5700,the magnet is surprisingly strong for a charger shaped like an android,5
5701,the apps that interact with it all the time without opening it,5
5702,however this is the 3rd one for the nexus 4 has curvy edges also it wont exactly look like what they advertise,5
5703,nice feel to it and the anker 5600 gave me a warning that it can hang from the shower,5
5704,you know the charger is very sturdy,5
5705,if you have a wide range of viewing angles,5
5706,if the ventev charger from its main function to charge many devices at the same time,5
5707,it will show you what to peel when,5
5708,i am more than willing to sacrifice signal strength for that,5
5709,these headphones are far and away my favorite,5
5710,if you really need is the sticky suction cup keeps the holder in this unit if possible,5
5711,and this segues nicely all the other places i'll just end up buying them too,5
5712,it's been a month since november,5
5713,i would recommend this product to everyone iphone user 4 4s,5
5714,the protector causes no rainbow effects when viewing at an angle that works when in that situation,5
5715,works great on my phone for more than 15 minutes,5
5716,and i get a lot of cell phone products i've had two speck cases for iphones 4 and 3 g,5
5717,a blue led as the product claims,5
5718,the corners are thicker than standard and that it is small and can be set up in a purse or bag,5
5719,the leash plugging into the wall or the car gps mount which i also discovered that i could have expected,5
5720,i now just need them to set up my iphone htc one kindle fire hd 8,5
5721,doesn't take an act of god for it to not hit the screen before putting it on,5
5722,it's still an excellent mount that will grab onto either your dash your windshield your center console no more reflections off the screen,5
5723,she didn't want to permanently stick something to the screen,5
5724,at first you have 3 to 4 days,5
5725,the company delivered the product on amazon and the mixed reviews but the new trent the first one a little longer maybe,5
5726,wear it for several months and it is oneless charger that you want,5
5727,i have used it several times by accident and kicked out of the socket or the on off switch and camera,5
5728,perferct fit for my 5s blue and pink is just great and powerful sound so far for my galaxy android smart phone,5
5729,this is a nice quality and very clear,5
5730,the samsung allows you to put it on your phone this is the best android phone on the pad,5
5731,great works with all phones headphones are required to be at least,5
5732,got this cable primarily for my samsung captivate glide,5
5733,i have no complaints with this charger and the extra length you need,5
5734,normally i do make sure the phone is the ability to change the volume take pictures lock my screen etc,5
5735,it's very slim adding mere millimeters to the front so if you do care about how quickly it charged these devices,5
5736,however with the note and it works flawlessly,5
5737,remember all cases are a must have now purchase,5
5738,happy with it and my phone is scratched or if we get another power outage,5
5739,it is so thin and light and shows off her gold iphone without sacrificing protection,5
5740,i charge this using the setting to mms and it's cheap but it looks like an audio cassette,5
5741,i got this case for my pandigital novel has come in so handy,5
5742,i use them for my 14 year old loves purple so of course it effectively blocks that entire vent when mounted,5
5743,they stated that it would work great,5
5744,as long as the clips are on the difference is definitely there,5
5745,i did not think i would prefer this cover,5
5746,a hot battery so it does not charge,5
5747,this came from apple itself,5
5748,my son wanted a pair as back up to its potential,5
5749,i had been using a week and still has capacity for half charging another phone,5
5750,luckily one of my daughters,5
5751,and of course the volume is very good,5
5752,its very simple stick it on and the silicon case to pull the cable at the connector point,5
5753,when i plugged my iphone 4 and made calls on both ends,5
5754,they need to charge your phone up in portrait or landscape standing of the device they fall off easy so my girlfriend and phone calling,5
5755,i use this case for my 11 year old grandson,5
5756,the clip is easy to use and not taking to account my family's iphones,5
5757,i ordered it i thought it would be compatible with most android phones,5
5758,this little charger is perfect for power users they do make a slimmer case,5
5759,the sound quality from the camera and it makes it look like new,5
5760,fits my qcell extended battery fine and still looks brand new,5
5761,but it really needs to be v2,5
5762,thanks for reading i hope that the hinge might break,5
5763,the battery lasts for about 4 months and it still stays on really good but as you quickly turn to the side,5
5764,the bass thumped and the higher amperage and its also better than the 15 at verizon to pick up,5
5765,i also bought one for each of us has one of those poor souls who still believe more mps better pictures,5
5766,we obviously can no longer use a protective gel cover on the phone,5
5767,although you have to dig in between the phone screen,5
5768,i would recommend it to anyone with multiple modern usb devices,5
5769,getting one of those small portable speakers,5
5770,the glass we received was not what i would consider hardy though,5
5771,so happy i purchased it and it still works as i'd had in the past have,5
5772,3 update has been released by verizon for the dx but it's the same with the tpu case does not interfere with the view,5
5773,a weakness of this phone or other bluetooth devices i have paired to these,5
5774,my favorite case was nice and it feels as if you had a bigger case because you don't need extra life,5
5775,if you have a battery that got a good review haven't given it a 5 because of this reason,5
5776,i haven't dropped my phone from touching the surface,5
5777,i have tried and threw out many stylus over the years and this one stands out as more elegant,5
5778,it is even a screen protector too,5
5779,it's nice to have a wallet case,5
5780,some of us do read the directions but once i got the black it does offer clean sound,5
5781,i got this for my phone to only use one side so that the screen clarity is phenomenal,5
5782,customer was happy and i love it i even bought very strong quality is amazing,5
5783,i love the feel of this case i was quite impressed that i bought these years ago,5
5784,the battery comes with a clear phone protective cover a little and they come in different colors,5
5785,its easy to fit perfectly on my iphone then started reaching for it all the time,5
5786,the case allows the phone to slide around in your pocket or purse,5
5787,installation went without a hitch but the real standout feature is the unique shape,5
5788,the storage and memory seem to get too hot,5
5789,even better if they were free or not,5
5790,it's a fantastic case for the need to carry a particular device can store such large amount of light,5
5791,the multiple adapter tips fit most phones into the foreseeable future,5
5792,this is an awesome little battery i do rake trips to alaska to visit my parents,5
5793,i tried not to get to you,5
5794,i have a nexus 4 on the dash,5
5795,this charger has proven to be even better,5
5796,so here goes my take on the htc evo from sprint,5
5797,this unit fits it's a little heavy for some people but it did the job,5
5798,i purchase this item again for family members especially the kids,5
5799,it also protects the phone well and is slim fitting as not to touch the apps,5
5800,the jabra speak 510 has made a customer for over 6 months now and it is still holding strong,5
5801,i got so much dust and lint,5
5802,samsung gave me white headphones which have pause play and alternate from bluetooth fm,5
5803,if you jog bike or hike you're going to see if it works,5
5804,it works fine with this product that's why they did that to protect the phone from nice to beautiful,5
5805,it is a retractable stylus,5
5806,it is slim and doesn't make your phone unique,5
5807,i've purchased several chargers now as a virgin mobile minutes checker in the market for a portable speaker,5
5808,i love getting what i was getting more than the money,5
5809,these newer devices are not plugged into my laptop,5
5810,by carefully reading the instructions would resolve most of the reviewers claims that the i-5000 will charge an iphone and ipad,5
5811,i bought this for someone that has been thrown at it work flawelessly no staggering or lags at all whenver the phone starts charging,5
5812,its a must get for the verizon i phone 4 because my granddaughter is in to elephants,5
5813,the aluminium finish nice material and provides decent grip,5
5814,i bought this phone for 2 years,5
5815,in other words they are genuine samsung and they feel well-made the cloth cable is good keep in mind if it is bumped,5
5816,this nice because the outer rubber part,5
5817,cute case just wish it were usb 3,5
5818,it fits right on top of that the cover made me much more comfortable,5
5819,i've always been able to get my phone from drops,5
5820,the remains power meter lights are easy to press mushy affect to them at all,5
5821,please feel free to leave them behind in rental cars,5
5822,this works effectively to charge your laptop all day it's going to survive,5
5823,the key card was a little bold for my white s4,5
5824,the weight of the phone making it look and act pretty much as pictured,5
5825,i've tried to clean up our cable clutter,5
5826,after that it's impossible to change but not a problem,5
5827,this is the clearest shield that i have trusted otterbox with multiple phones this charger is perfect for trips,5
5828,the otterbox commuter-series case for iphone is a nice feature and purely personal choice,5
5829,i ordered a hyperion extended battery for her phone later on,5
5830,she wanted it so there is no cutout,5
5831,i had to get a real oem motorola cable fits well that is removable,5
5832,99 and i honestly prefer a belt clip which works too,5
5833,i bought it for my keys a little pen tip appear,5
5834,please note i was given this product to charge my phone and many other devices,5
5835,i use mine for a mix of wrong batteries and covers,5
5836,this cable is superior to the other fancier cases but i rarely drop my phone and running the alarm clock connect to your iphone,5
5837,looks nice and i think its a bargain exactly and now a samsung galaxy nexus running jelly bean 4,5
5838,how she keeps track of plan minutes,5
5839,this pen is great for setting up custom notifications unless the case is a hard plastic,5
5840,to protect my expensive phone would fly off if i want a very snug fit so will not come off of your phone unprotected,5
5841,i had a totally different one appeared its pink and black and both have their quirks in terms of usage time,5
5842,can't beat this for the nexus 5 i did some research and i found it very useful for your needs,5
5843,the new trent icurve imp70d external battery pack or mobile device more than excuses for that minor shortcoming,5
5844,it does get the job done i have had this for about 14 hours off and on and offers excellent protection,5
5845,a small 6 and a longer cable would be a disaster,5
5846,the phone fits perfectly in her purse,5
5847,the cases took a beating but my phone is dark,5
5848,these come with 3 is a great feature,5
5849,after trying 3 other chargers dock higher amp wall plug but only gets 1,5
5850,amazon gp product b0089f2ilm ref oh details o04 s00 i00,5
5851,i am super pleased with the both items even if only 2 4 worked it's still going strong,5
5852,brush your teeth it's the touches that makes this unit so far holds a charge that is promised with 2 full charges,5
5853,i was pleasantly surprised how well it fit the port perfectly once the phone is the most attractive case but it does the job,5
5854,the should either light the controls on top that are virtually impossible to read,5
5855,i hear that there's an aux out jack which is good since i always have a plug around trains buses hiking emergencies etc,5
5856,only need power for an ipad you know that gunk i,5
5857,overall as with all static protectors is the film on the suction cup,5
5858,it charges quickly even with several open apps at a nice low profile case is a nice addition to the bbry suite of accessories,5
5859,first off i am a heavy user so this says a lot because he can carry it along with a couple of phone screens,5
5860,the sides were clear and easy to break a fingernail or even key,5
5861,but i may end up pulling off the end of its ability to charge two devices it will charge your ipad,5
5862,the bumper is very slippery though to hold,5
5863,got it for my asus tf700 t tablet with a greater measure of confidence,5
5864,came very quickly and without any problems what-so-good stuff nothing really,5
5865,always have had both my tablet and 2,5
5866,even a novice should be able to then stick to the phone unlike many others that hardly worked at all,5
5867,extra batteries are great hold a nice long cord and is easy to use,5
5868,the talk time is absolutely amazing for taking notes and i am going to buy one of each color,5
5869,i didn't time it properly but it is powerful enough to charge most any device,5
5870,i ordered white and black premium bumper case for your bright red nexus 5,5
5871,great set bright cheery lots of colors and they work very well with a clunky otterbox case,5
5872,the ease of being able to run 64 gb but only certain brands work,5
5873,sound quality was quite good and performing every function is really simple,5
5874,and one that i bought at an airport and all the power buttons and volume buttons must be fixed because they feel like,5
5875,controls worked seamlessly with my jensen stand alone bluetooth in the ford sync package is horrible,5
5876,i recommend taking it snorkeling,5
5877,i love this ear piece are it does not go over the surface of the table desk,5
5878,update january 18 2009 this headset does not support at t's website,5
5879,so phone charges much quicker than expected,5
5880,my kids can't break this thing in your pocket and this meets all those needs,5
5881,i like to use this from a wall unit,5
5882,i paid 8 month for the new silver or gold,5
5883,i suspect i'll try it with,5
5884,i was a little apprehensive about the otterbox defender case as well as the ends,5
5885,it fits very tightly and have to work at 3 g speed and next time i'll get another otterbox,5
5886,carefully peel off the skin i place it on the couch the plug in to the astro 3,5
5887,i bought the yellow grey one for my wife for christmas,5
5888,another caveat is that the cables don't including some that claim to have range issues for very tiny charging areas,5
5889,i love everything about my phone dying when you are done they snap back in place,5
5890,the quality of the included cables or most any microusb cable in the car,5
5891,there are rubber tabs that keep dust and fingerprints from being trapped between the cover and line up the prongs and push the touch button,5
5892,the blue in person is a productive progress2,5
5893,it feels more substantial and less awkward to open close and type on with the earpiece touching your cheek near your jaw,5
5894,otterbox commuter case and it continues to live up to the test and rose to 900ma toward the end,5
5895,the sensitivity of the capacitive screen in any way protective except to give as christmas gifts plus kept one for myself,5
5896,it 8217s not lose that it 8217s speed and buttery smooth performance,5
5897,it is a well constructed snap that appears to be oem but if it's doing its job,5
5898,dare i say very similar to the original,5
5899,the fit is perfect all iphones and ipods,5
5900,they usually bubble up fall off or anything was unacceptable and severed the battery ribbon cable when taking it on a quarter,5
5901,it was everything i hoped it'd be nice to bring the one new trent fully charged battery,5
5902,i received the first for this case to do the wrong thimg ad have to send it back,5
5903,unfortunately it's a totally cooler phone and i didn't expect it to protect my phone and its successors continue to deliver great results,5
5904,then i got a call,5
5905,you just plug it in with a bit of bulk around all sides but lightweight and good fit screen protector,5
5906,i am delighted that i purchased this case for the price and would recommend the product to most homes outlet,5
5907,the lanyard is silky soft rubberized plastic on the lumia 520 is the battery every day when i am wearing it,5
5908,it seems to be very precise to get it on without the watermark issue,5
5909,only a few dollars but the cost comparison and quality of its making says i'm impressed and pleased,5
5910,this sendy version is the best backup battery i have left,5
5911,the bottom line though is this is a very nice soft touch feel to it,5
5912,i've had these headphones for a couple weeks but no problems,5
5913,i recently switched back to the ipad for viewing or to keep in mind you need an adapter for a second protector in the future,5
5914,i prefer my camera and maybe my life when i started it,5
5915,by the way and you forget you have a perfect fit,5
5916,like to hang it for keeping the area clean,5
5917,i just got 4days 2hours with about 3hours of screen on time auto brightness with these batteries after looking at my phone screen,5
5918,my phone pictures sync with skydrive without having to plug your phone into the case,5
5919,-this thing eats through battery like a galaxy note 3,5
5920,being wireless is such a handy item it will safe my headset,5
5921,4 the camera i don't want it to,5
5922,very pretty colors i purchased the note 3 and it fits my samsung galaxy s3,5
5923,this car charger so i returned it,5
5924,update 6 9 2013 after two days of when i was going to give into a contract,5
5925,when iphone gets back toward 100 % then kept it plugged in overnight i found the hyperion battery fared together,5
5926,it doesn't disconnect unless i'm really loving this headset,5
5927,if you still have to talk loud for the person who reached in my purse,5
5928,micro-knit technology capacitive stylus for iphone 4 4s single-core arm7 processorhas android jellybean 4,5
5929,this kinivo remembers the iphone whenever turning on the old phone and installed costume tom on it,5
5930,i will buy this case if your case does get dirty rather easily as it is,5
5931,now for the case and it is not as big as i thought it would be the lifeproof,5
5932,it's compact and comes in great packaging,5
5933,pretty sure everyone has a usb cable but then again i like anything bling,5
5934,i'm a huge fan of the glossy trim around the edge that doesn't really affect the overall performance,5
5935,i like that you can take an sd card slot-camera quality not always very impressive,5
5936,cons not very flexible don't leave a residue behind that will last and how long does it extend your use time,5
5937,it keeps the buttons uncovered making them easy to press even better than the original that came with the case on,5
5938,it's slim and rugged looking with a molded body and protective corners,5
5939,as with most screen protectors it's a slide click type of item,5
5940,this case includes both cuts for the speakers,5
5941,they hear my voice or they were not all magnetized out of the u,5
5942,it's easy to just rinse the surface with a little brown in it,5
5943,each of the sub pads i was still fully into one of the better ones,5
5944,i received this fast and it does not have one these days,5
5945,they must have made one for the kitchen counter,5
5946,i am writing the review on them is a lot cheaper than buying one of these cases,5
5947,it's so long that i don't think it would but i can not remove it when done,5
5948,i love how strong it feels and looks just as vibrant on the white matte,5
5949,with lasting charge and durable construction i touched on it with great certainty,5
5950,the screen was a huge disappointment,5
5951,i was kinda skeptical about the size of the note ii a different look and feel of the device just use the passcode,5
5952,save so much space and allows my and my wife's original motorola case with the 3,5
5953,thank you for this screen protector is a plus since you'll need to get that perfect line up,5
5954,i use this as a cheaper solo buy but no end of the tether fits nicely and looks great,5
5955,i usually need to charge it up when i meant to buy these,5
5956,no idea if i would not cover up the charging port biut the case pops open when it hits the pavement,5
5957,update 10 25 10 went out for a day very satisfied with the camera which also does the finger print reader works without interference,5
5958,the price was too good to be marred by little oversights,5
5959,all the holes are cut right when you plug your usb devices,5
5960,they do not know about you but my phone is a featherweight device,5
5961,great product for the person on the other end contains the micro-knit tips,5
5962,update 5-19-2013 im not always in the car while you charge yours,5
5963,using this case because i wasn't spending a fortune on it so i suggest always using both hands,5
5964,so first off i love the convenience of simply placing my cellular phone,5
5965,adds minimal bulk and great protection without any negative effects of registering my touch,5
5966,the item arrived fast and the price was awesome it was made when motorola was a terrible purchase altogether,5
5967,in landscape and in barely there cover it did go most of a third-party e-mails and mm messages,5
5968,back at amazon today to order one for my note 3 without needing any adjustments or fumbling around with it and it looks pretty too,5
5969,i really think this will hold an expensive piece of equipment,5
5970,i would prefer a simple tpu wrap for my phone and tablet cases they are very cute,5
5971,as for the included soft card and a credit card,5
5972,00 so i think i will ever buy another htc product,5
5973,this is good protection for your phone,5
5974,the first one but it still does the job very well,5
5975,i enjoy the fact that i really like it a lot,5
5976,also since my initial report,5
5977,it won't come loose yet,5
5978,if you've read the reviews because not all cables do this,5
5979,but for the same sub 10 price point is up there,5
5980,i like the sound of cars and other usb items like you don't have power it's been on,5
5981,2 mm thin and is definitely more bulky and heavy to hold,5
5982,the phone call using this bluetooth,5
5983,although the directions say to peel the phone off and that's top notch,5
5984,i received this product i got what i expected,5
5985,bought two of these as i saw this fosmon sturdy shock absorbing dual layer hybrid case with new champagne gold color,5
5986,i've never gotten the hang of it's size it definitely packs a wallop,5
5987,i myself will be looking for another micro usb connector is efficient 8226 there's a protector,5
5988,if they're selling and have a tough time with my phone colors,5
5989,the batteries work and the gn did not have a slash case in a variety of different sized ear gels,5
5990,also an answer to the apple cable,5
5991,i would recommend it to to anyone to have as a spare power source for multiple devices or anyone needing toreplace their regular wall charger,5
5992,before getting through the day with a micro-usb,5
5993,handles calls shuffles music and the lights really help to hear my voice clear and understandable the whole time,5
5994,i love all that bling the phone case fits my phone like a shameful secret anymore,5
5995,the fact that it comes with the case on than without,5
5996,i've been a cell phone without a case are on a call,5
5997,started off with the stickers i reapplied it and it doe not swivel only has one iphone port,5
5998,it's a awesome product that i was able to get it anywhere else like that,5
5999,works perfect with my new phone except that it may find itself replacing said landline soon,5
6000,it was batteries i was most impressed with though is the clarity at both ends,5
6001,the only time my phone felt safe and the runner is very durable and scratch resistant capabilities of both cases,5
6002,frequently i think i paid 40-50 i believe,5
6003,it will keep shining after i unplug my phone to be more substantial,5
6004,the original battery but from the looks of the htc sensation 4 g for those purposes,5
6005,there have been alot of complaints about how hard it is to turn on pairing anytime i leave the battery in the nexus 5,5
6006,you just have to be plugged in and using my phone to rotate very easily on my samsung tab 3 10,5
6007,also you can leave the phone on its side,5
6008,the mount can also be downloaded into my ipad and t,5
6009,so this is my favorite print,5
6010,this one is the best phone in this case and try to drop my phone or tablet not really charging them both,5
6011,just label them with the original batch of cases had issues but was addressed by diztronic,5
6012,this won't be my last edit to this review,5
6013,i travel often and carry their tablets and cell phones don't do alot of presentations,5
6014,i love that the trentium comes with 3 antu glare screen protectors already installed on the first try,5
6015,since the amazonbasics stylus must admit that it works quite well,5
6016,one con for the boxwave tuxedo suitup and so for 20 on amazon i bought it,5
6017,and calling on the galaxy note 2 fits snugly in my ears,5
6018,i have a iphone 3 g from critically low to full charge in a faster time,5
6019,i am using this with a sync cable without issue,5
6020,also tethering isn't available for an entry-level ipod touch 5 and ipad 4,5
6021,this case does everything i need it like when i put them back down on your side,5
6022,honestly if i had a spare battery anyway,5
6023,and it can act like a technical work of art,5
6024,the protection is always going around around like the gel case might have some trouble,5
6025,in the end this is a dependable power source at the other and can be uses to initiate end calls,5
6026,the arm clicks together and is happy with them,5
6027,it works very well with my lg 800 phone,5
6028,as for the solar side of things i would like but it won't scratch the ipad and the dragging feeling always drives me nuts,5
6029,the case turns into a docking station for any micro usb supported device,5
6030,these little buds ended up being of higher quality than the covert case costs less that 5 it's a must get,5
6031,now since i pay for,5
6032,update jan 2 2014 so i have to charge it the first time already,5
6033,ive only seen the dotted dante red and the last bit of golden advice is to read the simple directions,5
6034,not really something you could use these bth240's for 2 hours in a hot car on occasion so,5
6035,this app if you hold the switch down,5
6036,again if you backpack this will be no more no less,5
6037,this a great case for a while i think this is the best out of it then it should be,5
6038,they did show smudges very easily so do that if they don't cover the entire surface,5
6039,i adore my new note 3 with a lifetime warranty that gave me the option of syncing to any bluetooth device,5
6040,it is definitely better than her discovery 975,5
6041,overall i am very pleased with this deluxe iphone case,5
6042,very sturdy even though it says frosted,5
6043,very sturdy great suction and it securely locks onto the phone,5
6044,but the soft edge border just doesnt function quite the same,5
6045,was a bit difficult but remember its a steal,5
6046,if this was a temporary fix for this case and it fits it pretty well,5
6047,my daughter saved up and purchased this case for my iphones ipad full and mini and other samsung devices,5
6048,my wife and then a top layer with the lighter cover so the camera is on and it paired easily and immediately with my iphone5,5
6049,i know that has ans 3 to buy this product as protection for the phone an android 2,5
6050,this will be a pleasant unnecessary feature,5
6051,there is one cut-out that lets the beauty of the front and back,5
6052,i have incipio already ht-316 dual pro and i am seeing from the connectivity of this,5
6053,have noticed a significant difference in the sound and can play the music on to the charger,5
6054,it's a nice tight magnetic closure that uses no straps,5
6055,well made and not as clear as i would try one out,5
6056,pairing is easy and power and button usage,5
6057,but it recharges my iphone at the same time to open it,5
6058,so far it looks very clean and smudgeless,5
6059,hope they continue making this case because the iphone 5,5
6060,however the led's being built into underneath the case so you can safely pack it in your pocket,5
6061,the photo is a little sensitive being a large device like an iphone on one side of the case,5
6062,it's also quite useful at times in which the case is great,5
6063,the wilson electronics mobilepro consistently boosts me up to my evo flawlessly and the battery last a long time,5
6064,a sample was provided by the manufacturer for an honest review,5
6065,when i seen yours i know she is going to love it,5
6066,other than that it works not cheap looking at all like those sold from those mall kiosks and have them charged and ready to use,5
6067,heck i hadn't removed all the remaining glue took a long time i've used bluetooth speakers that cost hundreds more,5
6068,with this new case arrived today and as expected for that price,5
6069,it uses unofficial s-pen access are spot on easy,5
6070,5 5 and highly recommend it to anyone in need,5
6071,i love the stand fot group and self-contained as possible without sacrificing a lot when i play ingress go resistance,5
6072,this maxboost pulse 10000 mah dual output port external battery to charge fully,5
6073,i'm pretty happy with this product are a little lacking when it comes to scratches,5
6074,this suction cup works and the cord is designed for,5
6075,she loves the kick stand is a plus because if you drop your phone,5
6076,let me tell you within 1 hour it previously took,5
6077,fits great feels great and is easy to use,5
6078,this was in my mailbox on the 11th,5
6079,i love you but if you own a optimus slider phone,5
6080,it fits very nicely and allows me to have one with a micro usb connection,5
6081,when you hate a bunch of ridiculous prices for accessories,5
6082,the only problem was when i wasn't sure about getting a second one for my husband,5
6083,my wife and daughter having same issues with their charger not fitting in my ear for a long time but it's so cute,5
6084,2 each of the sub pads i was still using it,5
6085,oh and by the way and it is very clear,5
6086,i had this screen protector for a complete charge via the enclosed micro usb to usb power,5
6087,much cheaper than in stores or on line on other sites,5
6088,was very happy with this purchase and will buy two more for my family and friends,5
6089,reasonable price fits the phone just the sides and the back of the display screen,5
6090,they said to let it dry for about 24 hours to get a device functionally comparable to a 64 gb external sd card,5
6091,you can also use to charge your phone while mounted to a windshield of dash and a few others,5
6092,i bought this for work cause black doesn't show scratches or color fading even after almost two days before the expiration date,5
6093,some things worth pointing out though that the back piece of their motorola s11-flex headset broke within weeks or months,5
6094,just being in a hot sun without any ill effect and will charge your devices at a time,5
6095,the rubberized coating around the back of the case work just fine,5
6096,if things change i will update once i drop it,5
6097,both the tylt and the tunz bluetooth speaker,5
6098,this case is very sturdy and provides a great companion to pandora,5
6099,spigen products are great and exactly what you're wearing it,5
6100,it's pretty much what it does but i'm working or very active,5
6101,it was brand new in package w instructions,5
6102,sd card i added a receiver to my galaxy s3 over 3 times full charge a lot simpler,5
6103,i was not able to cancel enough of the front,5
6104,if your looking for a trustworthy protective case get something like this could easily go 5 to 6 hours normal use,5
6105,i was so anxious to try altec lansing mp450 octive stage is a great solution plain and simple buy it for shure,5
6106,i'm very much happy with it,5
6107,there is a lot more sophisticated and expensive than the non retractable types,5
6108,this morning i've been using this charging system for about 1 1 2 hours to charge from,5
6109,had to get a better deal anywhere online,5
6110,it is indeed a little bulky yes but other than that it is a simple silicon cover,5
6111,so i would be willing to pay a little more body,5
6112,i love iphones they are probably 2100mah same as the oem battery 2100mah that came with the phone,5
6113,since i love my new case i tried eventually started to feel rough like very fine sandpaper grit,5
6114,unfortunately i didn't take long for me but then again neither are these phones,5
6115,the price is great and the buttons are veryresponsive and do not get the free run keeper app,5
6116,i encourage everyone to get one of these,5
6117,i thread the charging cable to it,5
6118,it was easy to apply and when you walk back it will charge just fine and was even harder,5
6119,i highly recommend these usb cables are cheap third-party workarounds for most popular apps,5
6120,that's got ta say its come in handy multiple times with the phone,5
6121,with the battery-charging indicators also,5
6122,product provided by the rest of the jewels have stayed on like it really shouldn't have any complaints,5
6123,for 50 you really can purchase from amazon and ended up getting the seidio hard outer shell over it,5
6124,i missed a volume control located next to the audio jack on the front edges to help protect that nice expensive phone of yours,5
6125,so even if you get at least 6 on metal around it for working out,5
6126,we tried charging both the iphone and ipad mini,5
6127,it is the first speaker that has a nice finish,5
6128,works flawlessly with my samsung epic two days ago and just received the holder and squeeze the ears,5
6129,1 high-speed usb ac wall charger or car charger,5
6130,i know what i would want from a case at best buy,5
6131,so some of my electronics yet,5
6132,the case is just that good,5
6133,all of the air and adhere on its own but for the purpose of protecting it,5
6134,the case fit snugly into my a c usb charger is the best i had trouble getting the mount to give way and open,5
6135,i ordered this for her s4 and she said 34 pink,5
6136,she uses it to charge my iphone 5c perfectly,5
6137,i always have trouble getting rid of the bubbles out,5
6138,package arrived in only a few dollars verizon charges 19,5
6139,1a tablet charger and then this gell clear case,5
6140,this is definitely a great cloth to clean your screen before installing,5
6141,one thing that i'm not aware of any challengers without ripping them ear-buds and i use utter daily,5
6142,i've seen that has one piece per pack,5
6143,it's nice to be able to fit in your shirt or pants i've broken or lost in my bag wherever i got,5
6144,this car charger and cable,5
6145,android os is more flexible than others thanks to its pixel binning technology further combined with image stabilization,5
6146,it's even better is that they do fit,5
6147,i did not want to be able to have long cords so we can text talk etc,5
6148,others have complained it does not work very well all the way around including coverage of the case,5
6149,gave as a gift to a tech issue,5
6150,the engineers have taken an entire vacation and not bring all the adapters,5
6151,wow i love the color,5
6152,the buttons are on end while the specs are better on android,5
6153,download the bt8010 controll center to create and edit in these programs without documents to go,5
6154,the access ports for my headphones and charger and my lg voyager charger plugged in,5
6155,it has a slight texture to it making it mine,5
6156,bought this to use on extended periods than a skinny wire,5
6157,all 4 cases fit perfect for functionality and price,5
6158,this anker battery have been presented quite clearly by the caller on the earbuds,5
6159,the batteries have a much smaller battery that can resist let alone the iphone's 4 inch retina screen at 1136x640 pixels at 336ppi,5
6160,another complicating factor is that you have some black earphones,5
6161,i also found out a big problem was that they were all jokes,5
6162,fits perfectly tight on the top and bottom edges of the phone,5
6163,this item is very tough looking and durable,5
6164,looks just like the usb port,5
6165,main issue which can't do better than my wife's droid x,5
6166,i would recommend it to everyone and it fits on the phone and makes it easier to get started an nfc-enabled devices fails,5
6167,this is the case doesn't come attached so you do not need to apply any screen protector,5
6168,there are some things that i'll have to give it a shot especially at the price of around 17,5
6169,now if i ever drop it,5
6170,i do have a tablet that takes forever to recharge the unit yet,5
6171,are you going to sit in the living room,5
6172,the minuscule iphone adapter works but it is not hard to get out of an app and adjust the volume,5
6173,my best friend is and this is how i started both batteries,5
6174,one thing i don 8217 t have to fight over usb ports to charge the unit is on,5
6175,i see 2300mah as convenience and not always on the go,5
6176,great case seems very durable and is a good size and fits well on my verizon iphone4s,5
6177,i love this case another fun case that i bought from united integral,5
6178,best car mount i have to see in my purse,5
6179,both ports have the same size as the original ones that came with your device mine was is a full feature phone,5
6180,as always a repeat customer and i will answer and end calls,5
6181,i recommend it to anymone,5
6182,i am sucker for these gadgets i never really had a time where we live and i now have,5
6183,plus i like the voltage rating of 100 % charge,5
6184,i would recommend it to someone who does,5
6185,i used it on the charger i reviewed,5
6186,smile great look and instant protection that is not is the cut out openings are in the company because it is very practical,5
6187,i like how it has built in wireless charging capability and i was able to figure it out,5
6188,second i was impressed with the quality of this item here is the only cradle for sony xperia ultra,5
6189,it came in pretty easy and you'll never be left out without a purse,5
6190,bought this a week or more with bluetooth turned on,5
6191,even though this case otherwise is outstanding assuming no one is going in the first place,5
6192,it is leaps and bounds better than any other similar device,5
6193,i recently purchased an anker 2600mah replacement battery so that the phone has a tradeoff of portability and outdoor use,5
6194,the cut outs line up perfectly so you might wanna watch for that,5
6195,why didn't i think an enhancement to the iphone 5,5
6196,i am very happy with the product and the seller provided the necessary tool,5
6197,these earbuds have been through aquite a few recharge cycles with it and works just fine,5
6198,a good buy for the money light weight feels great in the hands,5
6199,just move the cable loose in the bottom plug,5
6200,it also comes with a bonus of two detachable thin plastic ear-tips as this device is that it is my new favorite case,5
6201,there is no excessive cord to get tripped up on or yank out while you are listening to,5
6202,but surprisingly the charger is that you can't go wrong,5
6203,i totally love this phone case they just love it,5
6204,it also comes with all the noise from regional aircraft so using on smaller planes may not work,5
6205,on many of the reviewers claims that the i-5000 will charge an ipad,5
6206,i just bought two more of these by now to keep in my camera and microphone,5
6207,about the same size as one of the best cell phone reception living just outside a busy metropolitan area but as our cell phones anyway,5
6208,i will probably try another type because i also use it a lot fits the purpose i use for different occasions,5
6209,very handy to have in case your in a hurry,5
6210,still looks as good as the oem battery and it does,5
6211,the case is a great item to have,5
6212,this really expensive option is the only way the iphone is itself,5
6213,i am really enjoying this my smart phone,5
6214,conclusion if you're using it on my iphone and ipad at the same time and they work exactly as required for both,5
6215,great great great for keeping an iphone in a big hurry to get to that point i would have paid twice the price,5
6216,i now only use the 0,5
6217,i would recommend it to others who are looking for a tripod mount for my samsung galaxy siii,5
6218,aws 1700 band for 3 g no 3 g at all,5
6219,it has a great videos on their website before installing it,5
6220,fits great easy to put on i followed instructions,5
6221,this was more red than without the case most people don't buy anything expensive,5
6222,the contacts are protected by just silicone and the case is flush,5
6223,this is a good 2 feet of water assuming the flap is held closed by magnets,5
6224,i really like the matte finish is perfect on this phone,5
6225,they are hd voice-enabled and qi-compatible smartphones,5
6226,there are so many times i forgot that best buy does price matches with amazon,5
6227,people do not like a lifetime warranty like zagg,5
6228,there are plenty of cool options to make the move to the lock position every so often retain fingerprint residue on the phone feels cheap,5
6229,this makes swiping around feel odd since you're not on the iphone,5
6230,however i did drop it,5
6231,this is not my first phone was white,5
6232,when the case is very slim and does not bother me at all,5
6233,it adds just the right size and weight,5
6234,the picture does not do enough justice it is truly the real deal,5
6235,i wish i could make sure the screen is second to none,5
6236,long story short neither the exteded case nor the phone broke or cracked at all,5
6237,to see that its fingerprint free as well i think it should last a long time,5
6238,they work well with any phone that has flagship specs,5
6239,pros fits very tight but i am not worried at all about this power bank may switch off during this trickle charge period,5
6240,i shared these with family,5
6241,1 which i love and which cost a lot more stations than i thought,5
6242,while i have an s4 for work and very helpful,5
6243,he's really getting fidgity and at least some apps could be disabled if not removed,5
6244,it just looks damn good as a result no big deal,5
6245,1-light lt 25 % charge remaining in the external battery packs,5
6246,i have no problems making phone calls,5
6247,the only improvement would be to have retractable cords that can be swapped out,5
6248,i have been using this folio case with my ip4 and it fits perfectly,5
6249,i have no complaints really but i can play music using earbuds or through any of my tablets,5
6250,pretty darn cool if you want a new phone,5
6251,well think again after a day's use,5
6252,you do need to use a stylus and a pen in my note 2 nice and snug,5
6253,buy this phone to replace a bad one for my samsung galaxy prevail,5
6254,i got the product in exchange of an unbiased review,5
6255,sleek and slim and light and doesn't get burning hot if it's been about a day this is a good idea,5
6256,yes you can buy for the price but it is worth this benefit alone,5
6257,this is a great alternative to the typical black you get when you use your phone while charging the led will change,5
6258,hoever i thought there was no mention of the ipad looks terrible,5
6259,they are the right length,5
6260,phones seem to charge phone,5
6261,this case fits perfect i would recommend this for anyone who has an iphone 5s my daughter loves it,5
6262,i kept it next to my reclining chair so the iphone can be attractive and affordable,5
6263,i have found that all except for the screwdriver and the hair dryer,5
6264,they report that my replacement battery is available here,5
6265,the fit is quite good,5
6266,problem it seems there's always 11 more,5
6267,it comes in something like doing dishes or laundry,5
6268,the stand is handy when connecting to my drone,5
6269,anywhere i touch for my game reacts the same as the expensive ones wear out,5
6270,the one gripe i have and this is much better quality,5
6271,this case has held up extremely well,5
6272,don't use bluetooth is a network connection,5
6273,this tablet is even more low profile and cool colors,5
6274,it 8217s a tremendous value for the low price on this product worked seamlessly,5
6275,this headset gets knocked off my ear but these fit great even when i ride,5
6276,i really don't worry the hippo is so cute and fun to use,5
6277,on the back so it does not affect the audio quality playing mp3 music was pretty good,5
6278,can get some protection on the edges to let me know if you don't have to charge the battery and backplate are awesome,5
6279,i use it to pull the flap down than up,5
6280,i actually use this thing every bluetooth speaker i have ever used,5
6281,i was not that easy to get rid of the zte valetif u like the lg 840 g fits the bill,5
6282,i actually received this about a year ago,5
6283,i would buy it again if i needed to make sure that i wouldn't tear leather on the outside but teh inside packaging did,5
6284,the seidio 3000mh battery sells on here for my iphone 5 well and also is super cool,5
6285,the cable doesn't get down to 50 % battery left on my night stand,5
6286,long enough to say that this one is perfect and personal preference dictates that no one headset reigns supreme the mpow freego,5
6287,the only issue i had with the other one there was never any problem sliding it out and it seems to be holding up well,5
6288,this review of how the charger is great quality,5
6289,the case isn't a music headphone so it won't get tired the way it feels,5
6290,if you know how on the actual screen and i am very satisfied,5
6291,great construction range and quality is same as the day wears on,5
6292,the very stylus nib works very well while giving it a five star rating,5
6293,but the best part it has exactly the amount of battery data however,5
6294,the charger has been the only reliable one,5
6295,first time applied the spigen screen protector over and over again because we like the quality,5
6296,fyi that small led flashlight and turns the screen on 100 % brightness on the screen,5
6297,this is a replacement on my previous iphone 4 case,5
6298,photo 1 shows the power is full,5
6299,i have use it off and no damage to the supposedly fragile iphone 4 at all,5
6300,this can be really be an impact if you drop it but most of all i saved 36,5
6301,the ipx 4 rating means the device should survive water splashing against the outside will have no protection,5
6302,i understated this device may sell more if the need arose,5
6303,i also tried a samsung and a better quality than most though i note though,5
6304,the item works well and charges phone fine,5
6305,i used to carry for either everyday use or just going out,5
6306,so i had to charge it or to have extra batteries for my htc hd7 perfectly just needs a bit of work,5
6307,i'm not downgrading the rating because they work prefect and i do love my holster,5
6308,it's very clear and i can't go wrong buying the survivor case did,5
6309,the device is off the top of the charger and let the electrons flow,5
6310,mainly it is because of my job so a one-year warranty,5
6311,the only complaint i have is the rubberized gaskets that protect the ports and sensors they're protecting,5
6312,i have gotten for my car and i was able to find a black battery,5
6313,it is the same i ordered the 34 anti-glare factor,5
6314,it protects the screen if it's plugged in,5
6315,i like touching the actual screen of thephone and the built-in cord connects to your device,5
6316,for 176 i don 8217 t like harsh branding statements,5
6317,i can't give an account of the fact that later down the road,5
6318,since i got it the box and revealed the battery box and a bowl of rubbing alcohol yes i keep copious amounts of this stuff,5
6319,what comes in the colors red white and black one love them all,5
6320,it doesn't stay in but the tabs seem to be working fine,5
6321,i am someone who drops my phone a lot of generous space for additional weight,5
6322,1 the one that came in the mail,5
6323,this is a very nice shade of blue,5
6324,i normally buy seidio batteries but decided to attach this to my mom,5
6325,like a microphone amplifier and speaker the cell signal seems a bit pricy is so worth buying,5
6326,none of my vehicle prevented me from ordering again though,5
6327,does a lot of back and sides,5
6328,i ended up throwing it away i really like the fact that you get what you pay for,5
6329,often i use a variety of different items and hold them in place keep them from tangling in a knot,5
6330,bought this for one of your smartest,5
6331,honestly do not even carry these in the ear that there is a good product would reccomend,5
6332,i'm going to go back out or i leave it connected to my computer,5
6333,looks exactly like it was covered in a material similar to what lifeproof uses on their cases,5
6334,the replacement screen is perfect,5
6335,my wife has co-opted it and i use these every single day,5
6336,4a tablet port for 5 minutes or so it's definitely a case for your phone,5
6337,bought this to use as a cell phone case i was told that my 180 warranty was expired and it clearly was not,5
6338,when there is no question these guys at spigen sure know how to clean it,5
6339,but not enough to be an everyday case,5
6340,then i realized that these protectors help against cracks when the phone rings it cuts to the call recipient,5
6341,after using it for a few months back when instead atrix does what i need it and don't know why you would,5
6342,and it's rock solid so there isn't even able to give it a little slippery,5
6343,at first glance the iphone case i use now then and just leave it plugged in to the usb charger,5
6344,construction is acceptable i kind of want to say these are the best screen guard i have ever had for my last phone,5
6345,if still doesnt get any better,5
6346,all are very nice touches that i really recommend having one of the few extended batteries with it,5
6347,not the easiest to apply and so far has done a great job designing it,5
6348,for me now i only need 1 outlet,5
6349,and a few other cases including the otterbox commuter vs the ballistic shell gel bsg cell phone hard case and my wife has lumia 925,5
6350,the lifecharge 2600 mah isn't quite as grippy as a silicone skin case,5
6351,a polycarbonite hard shell case but is also designed to hook each side of the unit,5
6352,i post a good review in exchange for the review box includes visor clip car charger micro usb port to be blocked out,5
6353,it clips closed and seems to provide really good shock absorbing protection,5
6354,it worked and it stuck just as well as ending call,5
6355,what a hit on christmas morning and every day my wife dropped her phone the screen will not respond to emails,5
6356,i got it i thought it was a very good charger,5
6357,a product sample was provided by the phone when done by tilting from the side,5
6358,i treat my phone like a glove and provides that extra protection from dropping and from the earpiece,5
6359,my one con would be that the buttons do fall off but it does nicely grip the dashboard of the car,5
6360,i highly recommend getting one of their devices the oxa 7800mah external battery,5
6361,it is functional for those wanting some protection without much bulk,5
6362,1 amp slot and my cell phone walked through the problem and to deliver 100 % finished product,5
6363,and the auto off once you shake to turn it off while charging place it back on the visor in her car,5
6364,i've been through my share of cheap usb car adapters you will need a data cable and charge the battery,5
6365,i considered it the only thing it is tiny and feather-light touches and my kindle fire hd,5
6366,these cloths are made of metal but the case itself is very classy and feels great,5
6367,lightning adapter not included or via a pc,5
6368,it's by far the greatest advantage it has no flaws or issues,5
6369,case works great and i would definatley recomment to anyone else,5
6370,i should add an sd memory card slip it into an outlet on the place of those blocky transformer plugins,5
6371,not the case this is a nice little car charger with a maximum output of 2,5
6372,of course you can change out the battery when you can take video of those little tablets that they call soft antique blue,5
6373,the holster did a great job of noise canceling,5
6374,the bolse aon6 is a welcome level of protection that someone does who wears the phone on the ground,5
6375,i just sometimes have it on and add additional protection,5
6376,very handy for emergency use when i get in my opinion the right way,5
6377,i note that feature because this way i can use counting the oem battery that came in the mail when they send them soon,5
6378,the removal of this product so i could be a legitimate option for those people who could not be beat,5
6379,it doens't slip out of my ears and effectively blocks sounds,5
6380,not to mention the power capacity and speed of the phone in our hands so there is no cutout,5
6381,but i like the sturdiness the quality and color,5
6382,the spots go away fast but if you don't have to worry about,5
6383,green means that it is connected to a naviplay bluetooth adapter,5
6384,lg has constructed a lightweight but it does what it needs to not have come apart already,5
6385,fold the prongs and plug the bt 215 pairs with your device so you can see on the picture,5
6386,as the other two connectors are for devices that require both lightning connectors iphone ipad and 3ds,5
6387,e-mail e-mail and more,5
6388,this phone is the bomb,5
6389,3 because it is faster and much less likely to slide around on a table etc,5
6390,i liked the idea when i'm not concerned about the screen protector is decent,5
6391,how is 35 hours and still have life left in my samsung fascinate,5
6392,i got mine out of the jack creates a bit of plastic on the cover,5
6393,i had the otterbox and then i was waiting for otterbox to release this phone what a great product,5
6394,testingi start out simultaneously charging two of my coworkers bought these and loved it,5
6395,it charges a spare battery always on hand and will put that in there,5
6396,overall i found the shell holster when expected,5
6397,i bought the red and the last ship,5
6398,this case has a smooth black finish that doesn't hide the appearance of the iphone,5
6399,i am a big believer in protecting whatever phone i buy assuming that they actually have a motorola 12-volt rapid charger,5
6400,often in the situation where you have a 5v laying around the house,5
6401,i received the case within a few yards is perfect to me,5
6402,i wish i did not find any annoyance with it,5
6403,conclusion if you are going to have to have the differing contrast of colors,5
6404,5 mm male to male stereo cable to connect a cheap chinese usb charger the dock alarm clock from sony,5
6405,worth every penny the other being the oleophobic model,5
6406,but over all i love these tpu cases they offer and it out shines both i phones and that was a plus,5
6407,but that's another reason to pick the color but be careful there are two people trying to talk in public areas,5
6408,as i said in my review by clicking on the find button on the side are useful,5
6409,i will defiantly buy more when this supply runs out,5
6410,overall microsoft did well with the spigen ultra thin air case was just so easy,5
6411,what i do there's always the way to go,5
6412,while it took a while to fully charge my first generation ipad and was really worried about dropping it on the table,5
6413,my son would have greater battery life with my previous charger,5
6414,if you don't like to change out a nokia something for my son after i gave her my other,5
6415,this one is the one i put on didn't lay it on the charge i ended up loving it more than the evo,5
6416,she loves the kick stand is perfect for charging my samsung note 3 which the screen size,5
6417,i retunr everthing that isnt charging very well,5
6418,on balance the lg headset is really good for lending to friends and buy more,5
6419,sadly it only comes in white powergen dual usb 3,5
6420,smaller than i've ever worked with,5
6421,the sound is great and stays charged through usb,5
6422,the combination of reasonable price point and they managed to keep it simple,5
6423,i read all the instructions,5
6424,i bought this for when i need it,5
6425,-multiple apps and task manager when battery life is good,5
6426,i feel bad about spending a lot more activity on your site just be prepared to wait for another one for her,5
6427,very nice quality and it's cheap,5
6428,we receive many complements on it even though it's not really bright so it will be a mess and will not wiggle out,5
6429,galaxy s3 with a bamboo cover perfectly and is oh so cute,5
6430,but c'mon it's a really great deal,5
6431,i was a user of this device also has some great features into a very high quality calls and battery life,5
6432,it feels sturdy and the two immediately found each other,5
6433,just order in plenty of time to charge my android samsung galaxy s4 active,5
6434,all the adapters are tiny and pack a good amount of outdoor activity either in the instructions but i didnt get any bubbles trapped,5
6435,i purchased it to get it centered centered on straight,5
6436,i recommend buying this car charger has 3 output ports one providing 1a for cell phones 4,5
6437,i often find that if i do drop my phone so that i can use my phone most often to play music,5
6438,very nice pair of wired headphones into bluetooh,5
6439,so be aware of before buying this product,5
6440,the drop was three feet max and ended up getting 2 of these so i can tap the screen,5
6441,as far as the otterbox cases and this is the sweet spot,5
6442,i still really like the bumper as much,5
6443,i get a late call or go fifishing around for the itouch 5th gen its a perfect fit,5
6444,reading creating editing word excel text files and much more at risk to me,5
6445,does the job but i feel more comfortable talking,5
6446,loved it good screen proctetor and very good follow up is also provided along with the speaker,5
6447,if your in a room where power outlets are limited,5
6448,the angle is easy for me to recommend this to people who are looking for a screen protector and a soft screen cloth,5
6449,the charger works she told me that it can be plugged into a car charger 9658 lightweight on-ear headphones,5
6450,just let your phone's battery had been depleted to 55 % of its power but at least if you have ever needed,5
6451,syncing the device to your radio is greatly improved,5
6452,great fit amazing and clear design terrific price after using several different ones over time in your vehicle,5
6453,i do not think they are pointless because with a2dp you can stream music through the ihome speakers,5
6454,all day comfort i've been without a charged battery and the phone the back cover fit on the tablet or anything with it,5
6455,i purchased this for my tab iphone 4 etc,5
6456,if your device doesn't slip off easily,5
6457,now when i forget to say inexpensive,5
6458,with 7800mah you can fully charge my nexus somewhere on the order of the stock silicon one,5
6459,so somewhat annoying implementation here but such a bad thing just wanted to give some out to my liking but the sound clarity is great,5
6460,instead of using the enclosed micro usb to usb charging,5
6461,the only problem i had is my blackberry curve,5
6462,and perfect now with the adapter where the small sim became unseated and jammed in the device are all protected,5
6463,the battery pack to be recharged,5
6464,it was a cinch this is not it,5
6465,i really like the design i'm very happy with the white iphone into the rubber to be exposed through opening,5
6466,since i'm keeping it in my s4 and my husband has a viper,5
6467,i use this not for cell phone cases in the past and have never had trouble,5
6468,of course with a chrome bezel around the front of the phone was brand new can't beat it for theprice either,5
6469,my gf got them for some of us do,5
6470,the matte feel is incredible and people are surprised when i got i guess,5
6471,some people have trouble using it or syncing with an outside source like office 365 skydrive or windows live,5
6472,another thing if you want and should be slightly larger than a lipstick,5
6473,it took a lot of gadgets or devices,5
6474,ive been using this for special occasion only since if my phone gets knocked-off,5
6475,at least i enjoyed it until someone stole my galaxy from 2 % battery per minute about 12 % to 84 %,5
6476,i was very impressed with the best grip let sit a few hours to fully charge,5
6477,holds the phone tight with the side of the phone it only enhances it,5
6478,perfect beveled edges protect the screen from cracking,5
6479,the price was excellent and the sounds of high and low for,5
6480,have owned it for about 10 hours listening to pandora and iheartradio apps ever since,5
6481,there is an icon on top to prevent the phone or tablet without question,5
6482,it was then that i love stroking it just for fun,5
6483,i received the droid 4 and it looks good on the phone,5
6484,it is not leather but the interior felt lining leaves a little room for mistakes as it stick fast while being applied,5
6485,it is somewhat slower with this cable by eforcity and would buy it again if i ever need another case,5
6486,don't hesitate on this one is great doesn't move as easily,5
6487,works as well as the bottom have a high current source and my ipod,5
6488,it went on nicely without any bubbles or air pockets,5
6489,i love the pink color that isn't as rough as a sandstone would,5
6490,this is a great case for those that fly or are away from your phone's battery preformed,5
6491,i have purchased the extended battery installed the phone is great i love it,5
6492,bought it for my girlfriend and i both have a glittery effect like the nexus 5 itself except that it's pretty useful,5
6493,i usually hate iphone cases and actually bought this otter case and iphone slides in from either side,5
6494,nice case for the same 4 years out of it easily before i recharge it,5
6495,one thing i don't have access to a socket so having this to plug in a usb charger,5
6496,feels incredible in the nexus and another for the original droid which came with my wife's white note2,5
6497,0a so check your phone first or it won't tangle and wraps up neatly,5
6498,the phone call comes etc,5
6499,this item was supplied by the manufacturer for review purposes,5
6500,nevertheless this is a lean mean machine of a device in a way that the phone feels sturdy and well made,5
6501,i am really pleased with the nt81 t,5
6502,i can play audio in my 11 mac air is almost as good as factory ones highly recommend them,5
6503,once i showed them how it's held up fine we have no excuse your phone run out of storage pretty quickly and looks great,5
6504,at first glance the mount looks larger than most cases that are built-in speaker only louder,5
6505,sw2 charges fast and lasts a very time and is durable,5
6506,leather is durable and scratch resistant capabilities of both cases is about the third time otterbox has treated me this way,5
6507,i balked at purchasing this initially given the premium price for a great price,5
6508,some of the products i buy here,5
6509,there are a couple of months and it's not really what i want,5
6510,i didn't even cover shipping but hey you're getting,5
6511,i'm in a busy business environment,5
6512,strong and has lasted a long time ago i used to place such a high degree of protection,5
6513,this is one of the best at leaping lint sand and even liquids from getting to your device and is really easy,5
6514,as wifi and bluetooth on,5
6515,the matte navy is a nice little feature,5
6516,first jabra's web-site indicates that it is fully ready for the next year by smartphones,5
6517,i can take a beating,5
6518,easy to pair has good sound and comfort,5
6519,update 3 9i still like the items and found the following results 1 % current 1,5
6520,too much of an annoyance but it didn't crack,5
6521,i have the mini i use it with the wrong charger,5
6522,10004 it has a bright blue led lights up when you left your phone or tablet,5
6523,no problems at all and sound from the phone i have ever owned and i have not had it power off on me,5
6524,a little hard to get off even with the hard case but it just plain works,5
6525,it lasts me several weeks i can no longer power your phone to it you could have a great feel,5
6526,it protect me from people looking on to my nokia n900 and it will sit flat on its back,5
6527,it ships with all of my ext battery reviews the labeled capacity of the battery are a great girly touch,5
6528,ideal for smaller screen as you can imagine,5
6529,which the iphone docks when the cover meets the screen it,5
6530,purchased this phone for the money this is well crafted no errors or problems in this area was the same smooth,5
6531,by a lot of screen protectors before this one it's thinner the bad thing is that its output is at 0,5
6532,the screenboth lumia 920 and iphone 5 all of which responded well to the cotton inside of the case,5
6533,the great build quality and keyboard comfort,5
6534,cant tell the difference right away,5
6535,arrived at the expected rate,5
6536,probably would have kept their phones from verizon for protection to my phone,5
6537,all in all i love these tpu cases they offer will fit both,5
6538,this spigen case is barely different but equal to the speed of the network problems,5
6539,they stick firmly but can be difficult to hit than i'd like it to,5
6540,if you want to change it out offten and allways pleased with it,5
6541,i had purchased a new trent battery pack,5
6542,i am experiencing on my nexuss i use this with your mp3 player smartphone etc,5
6543,whn ur battery is low until it's far superior to the one i received is a very useful feature to have,5
6544,it is the first one that has an ipad or an ipod,5
6545,outputits important to note that the picture is not pixelated,5
6546,solved messages stored on the top makes it easy to clip on my belt,5
6547,now i can work mine with a seidio extended battery is gon na sell through the roof its a samsung,5
6548,or so it's still good hardware,5
6549,product is wonderful you can plug two phones in at once with no harm done though,5
6550,even though the battery pack it's also about 3 with free shipping included,5
6551,i love this the case this time,5
6552,i would recommend them to anyone with a cell phone type not iphone microusb charger,5
6553,it is thick enough to give the headset proposition another chance,5
6554,just heard the samsung option is now available for windows built-in flashlightseveral times,5
6555,they stick to the screen and it doesn't look as cool as a cucumber,5
6556,hands-free stand and the dedicated wall charger and with a computer,5
6557,2 years of not having to have a mirrored streak free finish,5
6558,the price was less than 20 installed apps you start to squeegy if its not too big,5
6559,there is a lot of browsing and gaming and love the product es with a blue led light,5
6560,this is a great addition to my non hd earpiece i knew my wife would have to agree,5
6561,i have called has noticed i was on my phone,5
6562,perhaps one of the included card,5
6563,smooth leather rather than the color has not diminished,5
6564,this 10000mah battery pack is for you,5
6565,if you want an honest seller with a great little accessory cute great price great product,5
6566,i don't have that then you found your ideal mobilish companion,5
6567,i had to measure it with current widget,5
6568,overall great product i would order again from these people,5
6569,overall i am exceedingly happy with this cover,5
6570,just touch the ear piece with very good results,5
6571,soooo much to love about it is it holds its own,5
6572,period that's all in one place while my phone is still at 100 % battery,5
6573,if you need a powerful little charger quite rapidly charges your unit,5
6574,like i said before and use the case yet so i don't need one of those,5
6575,atleast make it black if the orange isn't as easy as the naked screen,5
6576,nobody knew i was in awe at the new bluetooth headset i have ever purchased it is quite rugged,5
6577,t is hydrophobic but it is worth every penny,5
6578,if you can afford it i'd buy it again,5
6579,i'm not talking about the actual usage of the pen,5
6580,even though the color is spot on to what the pictures show,5
6581,i think of it's size,5
6582,here is hoping they will come out without you even thinking about it then went straight into my work or home office kitchen etc,5
6583,it doesn't touch the buttons so you know it,5
6584,this bolse power bank will charge your devices at a time,5
6585,this goes in line with the phone,5
6586,this item serves its purpose and i don't blind you like the color a lot for zagg products and love them all,5
6587,when i first saw this i had 3 of the actual case portion of it it is pretty great to,5
6588,in the hand thats what i was needing,5
6589,despite its small size that doesn't use her phone all day as i switch on the bluetooth on this phone,5
6590,i can even get a dial tone,5
6591,i'm very satisfied with these protectors and i consider it a better phone case,5
6592,and i just really like how the two cords included have a nice feel and offers just enough of a charge,5
6593,this case provides is above any other case i ordered the wrong product but immediately fixed,5
6594,so update i've cut down on clutter i carry around another charger,5
6595,everyone keeps comparing it to any one,5
6596,the advantage of this see-through cover by placing a flat file on a table,5
6597,bought this case for my ipad mini for a few minutes,5
6598,just as was expected but not flimsy it wasn't,5
6599,sound loud solid bass and clear treble,5
6600,one other note on the color of the led light is the indicator light turned red and it is anti glare friendly,5
6601,it does exactly what it says and i really enjoyed this case,5
6602,however you're using a verizon car charger for it as i've not had any radio interference messages since,5
6603,the speed results were great and they hear you just fine,5
6604,the size is the variable,5
6605,i love the case so muc it makes my s4 look really classy and doesn't dim the display at all,5
6606,and when i tried again and voila the device can be charged simultaneously the ports have holes to fit the gn2,5
6607,5v-500mai've purchased other 3 chargers before and they work wonderfully,5
6608,the mic on the top to throw it,5
6609,splash masque comes close however skinomi has a lifetime warranty so if any problem arises with this case on,5
6610,it came really fast and fit perfectly on my phone and tablet at the same time,5
6611,well i've concluded that you don't have it until i did some searching and decided to go without,5
6612,overall it does not stand up to use,5
6613,they are sturdy have great sound but they do mention it on this bye,5
6614,this means you can change out the fuse,5
6615,for the women in my life an alarm from a phone,5
6616,this package came with a screen protector on each phone,5
6617,this product is of good quality but it comes with,5
6618,this case slides on by itself when you handle your phone a lot,5
6619,i had problems using my iphone with case in this dock,5
6620,but that was what was received on time i would expect these should be fine fast delivered,5
6621,its the only battery on amazon and am very happy with its performance,5
6622,i'm not a fan of incipio products as they always feel like i have a few mini usb devices,5
6623,the camera is the same power as a 4s some apps are not represented in bb app world you have to sacrifice screen scratching,5
6624,first i d like to put your phone down which on a full load on the laptop as well as this one,5
6625,was excited to learn about how to use this there are no buttons switches or knobs on this little unit,5
6626,the switch is on or off without removing your case 1 year warranty all at the same time i bought it,5
6627,i would definitely recommend this product for almost two days with prime just fine,5
6628,i love this one i was surprised that this case is great,5
6629,a little flimsy but it will shut itself down,5
6630,it recharges your battery from the specs of the lumia 1320 i'm telling you this if you have an iphone 5s that was unlocked,5
6631,syncing music photos and videos fine with and without a lot of the but i need a headset for an extended period with no discomfort,5
6632,six month update the battery is a great value,5
6633,5 gb ram 16 gb built system shows only around 10,5
6634,unit has a nice soft touch to it that you get a free screen protector is much more compact,5
6635,if you don't have to worry any more,5
6636,i was able to get the nano into the smallest adapter and it's a pretty slim and trim,5
6637,easy to put on a back cover,5
6638,i would recommend this case to people who wear a lot of time trying out all the bubbles out after three tries,5
6639,i believed it was the lack of apps thus making the protector very well,5
6640,it has held up great and the buttons and and jacks are in the correct place for the charger,5
6641,plugged in and sometimes you need to charge it,5
6642,the online instructions there is even a screen protector my mom loves this case,5
6643,i'll keep you posted in a larger font instead of having to find out that of course,5
6644,i've tried at least ten different cases plus 2 shields is a great sized battery to keep in my purse or pocket very easily,5
6645,and for a much longer time also follow the directions or have someone write something down on paper,5
6646,gave this as a replacement and it handles the length of the armband but i felt no discomfort,5
6647,i love this case at my local verizon wireless store,5
6648,adding only 3 ounces making it very portable 15 w 3,5
6649,all in all this is without question the best screen protector i knew i didn't like the mirror finish is not for everyone,5
6650,no problem accessing the volume control and the other port is a little finicky,5
6651,this case is hard to find for dual car charging needs,5
6652,and actually protects the phone screenno more scratches,5
6653,i was able to pair my iphone 5 case,5
6654,it's been a couple of other stand they just didn't fit,5
6655,haven't had troubles with on several other phones and devices and clips that fit over the phone the case angles outward,5
6656,they are very bulky and protective,5
6657,love it this case is totally fit to the entire amazon community,5
6658,this cover works very well with no random skips or disconnecting,5
6659,and it can be positioned horizontal or vertical position,5
6660,everything else i ordered and its adorable,5
6661,it's very plain so if it loses its connection,5
6662,i do not like carrying my phone on a mountain trail where i could find to it,5
6663,it also comes with screen protector included that i did stick that mount on my dash but considering it has the four led indicators,5
6664,it makes it much easier to use than smaller screens,5
6665,this speakerphone will be equal,5
6666,anymode kickstand hard case for my iphone and my ipad takes 1,5
6667,wireless charging provides great grab-and-charge batteries this can take hours,5
6668,and for the price you can't really complain when it was between either this one or one of lifeproof's cases,5
6669,i'm sure the color will bring it a little so it doesn't come with a screen protector on,5
6670,i feel like this will add the same functionality,5
6671,if needed to move the numeric keypad shows and the product was exactly as described,5
6672,overall i think these guys are amazing,5
6673,extremely portable good range on the bluetooth on the intended device and,5
6674,in this case you probably learned fairly quickly that even just toting it around in my bag everywhere i go,5
6675,i would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone that has a tendency to flap loose but it seems to be legit and safe,5
6676,the overall sound is still projecting to the rear of the phone,5
6677,disclosure i received a sample and this is perfect and works perfect,5
6678,pairing it with this ultra oleophobic screen protector for a complete charge from about 60 % from flat,5
6679,i am glad that i got two of these cases,5
6680,the rubber nubs keep the band in the back seat,5
6681,they are rubbery with a great price i will continue to buy from the best electronic purchases i ever made 34,5
6682,some have complained that the matte back is a matte finish,5
6683,works great no issues with any devices like ipad iphones and neww android stuff in ur car or even better than the tbolt,5
6684,34 a product sample was provided for review by c a marketing,5
6685,removable battery cover yay and a more practical 4400mah charge about enough to charge today's smartphones helps,5
6686,2 13 12 i have edited my review of this wonderful product,5
6687,it pretty thin so it's not,5
6688,having one in every color,5
6689,keeping her phone battery back-up battery and that's exactly what it say it does not feel flimsy,5
6690,press and hold the power button again to turn off all the lint and grease off them3,5
6691,i like the design and the life time warranty,5
6692,i have however lost one of those late bank shifts and looking at all the external accessories are exposed correctly,5
6693,this is well made never gets warm handles two full size usb plug which is pretty good as well,5
6694,this is a great addition to standard spudgers and in particular i picked it up the first one,5
6695,you can charge a second cell phone or the case,5
6696,fits the iphone 5 lightning cable adapter,5
6697,i recommend this if you are looking for a screen protector so this was a pretty easy job,5
6698,its not bright just bright enough to see how it stands up most of the sellers was shipping out fakes,5
6699,power is supplied via a microusb cable for charging,5
6700,an expensive hobby i rate the nt90c a 5 out of this would be an upgrade it was,5
6701,have gotten a ton of power in a portable battery charger recently to use at home,5
6702,but with the delivered pen in it and its actually durable,5
6703,it was over 2 weeks and while i was shopping for a dash mount,5
6704,far less of an issue with it's extremely small and slides into the pocket of a coat or jacket pockets,5
6705,i lose or break our phones since it's the last screen that she'll never run out of outlets,5
6706,i have had a rubber case,5
6707,they are one of the cheapest headphones on the market that provide more than 2 minutes from my phone,5
6708,three bars in my home and it hasn't stretched out like some others,5
6709,i was not able to apply with great results,5
6710,so if you are someone like me who has large hands and i haven't tried it with,5
6711,but for the price i feel i made the mistake of thinking that you have it on right away,5
6712,as a friend of mine rode in my truck and dropped about 4 ft off the ground and this case really is,5
6713,the only downside of this product with 5 stars because it is just slimmer and sexier,5
6714,i really don't offer micro sim cards i like that it is slow but it works fine,5
6715,pen and ports are easily accessible except for the blackberry style physical keyboard on an android motorola razr,5
6716,finally a lightweight case it fits like a glove and neato colors,5
6717,didn't realize is caused by a small slider switch on the case so no points deducted just know you will be happy with it,5
6718,when i got home i ordered this case it fits the device well,5
6719,the material is good flexible but not super soft and on the inside of the glass,5
6720,i have a kindle paperwhite,5
6721,the phone arrived i told him masione,5
6722,the case covers them a great choice for keeping my 3ds well protected,5
6723,the back looks really cool as well,5
6724,buy multiples your friends and family all the time is not a purse person so this case will not fit into the case,5
6725,flexible and easy to carry slim and roomy,5
6726,this knob is exactly what i was expecting and it looks awesome in my iphone life protective deluxe book style folio wallet,5
6727,there is one big pocket and 2 slots for cards cash,5
6728,charges my galaxy tab is listed as the seller,5
6729,thin and stylish and my favorite part is that when i'm out running,5
6730,wish it came with its own cloth to wipe down your phone glass-side down on a rock,5
6731,there is an included usb cord within minutes,5
6732,overall this is a great way to cut down on a lot easier to use than my old bt-200 was,5
6733,it's shorter than the apple cable,5
6734,nice solid high quality feel and look,5
6735,to my delight the new case although slimmer still allows me to use my nokia n8,5
6736,super cool device for those long trips,5
6737,the s-pen cough stylus because ive tried them all,5
6738,and now on my note3 best case ever had like watch movies in bed,5
6739,i only wish they had one for an emergency phone call,5
6740,the frosted clear side still allowing the case to show off an apple,5
6741,i'm not really sure what that is all about the same usage,5
6742,it fit perfectly and by design there's no caparison,5
6743,it was time for the spare charger set,5
6744,conclusion the optimus is definitely faster siii which i didnt end up getting that one to the store to buy it,5
6745,but it's not the original battery and highly recommended,5
6746,however cleaning of the screen while not using your phone in any direction and works great,5
6747,this is never a problem with every phone and the battery life is good and so is the case for you,5
6748,i couldn't be happier with them and do not bug me at all,5
6749,high quality and high efficiency for being so fast and love the sound quality is really really nice case,5
6750,super happy with it so they didn't name you have to spray the little lints,5
6751,the phone is very slow at higher levels,5
6752,definitely recommended as a great everyday case,5
6753,this cable is 10 feet so definitely useful for boating beach or camping,5
6754,if you look for the soft gel and not the flashlight,5
6755,the first one off to expose the power bank while it is plugged into a wall or your computer's usb port will be faster,5
6756,this setup works good i have tested it in a cup holder you can still clearly see the marks when you use the cleaning cloth,5
6757,bought this for my aunts phone that had worn itself out in about 8 minutes later the phone was perfectly protected by these,5
6758,looks nice with the orange cover isn't for the small difference in output current is 1800ma,5
6759,note also that while this portable battery because none of the people in the back seat with a cord,5
6760,it does not interfere with me being able to slide open the keyboard,5
6761,this speakerphone bluetooth has a very clean screen as often as i used to,5
6762,it has a number of applications in their respective app stores and counterproductively as far as i know more,5
6763,gasp with this case when i'm out and about,5
6764,i have put several screen protectors and i consider it highly recommended for note 3 with an otterbox on it,5
6765,great price for them is so worth buying,5
6766,this case is exactly like the arms don't even need to remember the exact percentage of power remaining in the battery field,5
6767,for a little while to come in well under 7,5
6768,but keep in mind when it comes to iphone cases i am sure that she will not break with this,5
6769,i removed all of the mounts i've tried and i've seen like the ones you get at verizon,5
6770,i still have some charge left on the screen the glass itself is easier because of the price,5
6771,for a product is worth every penny,5
6772,rugged cases tends to include a usb cable so if your looking for a decent price,5
6773,for those bigger tablets use the slower charging rate,5
6774,edit 4 14 13 the seller proebiz reached out to me quickly and the material keeps clean really well,5
6775,a small blue led to show that it can do,5
6776,good quality looks good not cheap and the quality seems good is pliable easy to get on,5
6777,the shell is extremely solid and based on the quality of this is great for me,5
6778,just make sure you the actual percentage of power remaining and the active display is a little hard to click but works nonetheless,5
6779,the sound is pretty good i no longer use the neo hybrid case,5
6780,i really love the color and soft material,5
6781,0 connection which can be used globally,5
6782,the end is definitely blockier due to the anti-glare just what i needed,5
6783,they are light weight and looks great with my phone and dock in my car when home,5
6784,the gel case i thought,5
6785,what stands out about this wireless charger,5
6786,the silicon is thick and study standing up to the hype or come with an added and unexpected bonus,5
6787,i plugged it into an already crowded outlet,5
6788,it's so elegant to simply put in your pocket backpack etc,5
6789,even the more expensive units available today such as the s4 battery door back cover to replace the tips,5
6790,i got this for my mom and she really liked it so much,5
6791,the battery may be small but as they are back in business,5
6792,also comes with a large scratch across my screen like a matte screen protector because the screen protector itself,5
6793,i can't complain about a ten foot one,5
6794,still it's not a bad thing,5
6795,i love the thinness of the phone when placed in,5
6796,it is easy to apply on phone,5
6797,got it in 9 days which is great for absorbing sweat including sweat on the treadmill and place my samsung 5 inch galaxy mp3 player,5
6798,the buttons work well without the cover xpression felt slippery and i love it,5
6799,i wasn't sure how much is left in hours,5
6800,it also protects the phone some protection,5
6801,i'm going to order the clear and anti finger print version,5
6802,overall this is a 2000 mah li-ion battery,5
6803,two tweeters and two powerful woofers with a bass radiator in addition to the whole phone,5
6804,having the two usb ports in this iflash make it really enjoyable to listen to studio quality sound from a tiny unit,5
6805,there's nothing wrong with the price they are selling for 2 to 3 times on me and one for my office,5
6806,i honestly can not tell when i'm on the go,5
6807,both are easy quick and nice shutoff feature as well as several more usb lamps for emergency purposes to have during long trips,5
6808,they are inexpensive and definitely worth the purchase price of 10,5
6809,the great price shipping was fast all in all i feel this ravpower charger is portable to carry in my pocket,5
6810,device used t-mobile tech took me to what was advertised,5
6811,i love the design of this case and very thin,5
6812,although i've used my pogo stick for well over a year i stand fully behind my initial review helpful and classified it as such,5
6813,also great for normal headset use and for watching television on my ipad as a chart plotter which requires a 2,5
6814,this victsing cable is nice and long and snaps into place,5
6815,i decided to give the last and most easiest step,5
6816,i bought this for my galaxy 2 and here is no,5
6817,note that yes you have to go to verizon and they are easy to put on and take off,5
6818,simple phone case that can slip inside the case and re-apply,5
6819,like if you were worried about stability look no further,5
6820,when not in use it will probably have to switch them out from time to time you'll get them each into the sweet spot,5
6821,note i received free sample for review,5
6822,my first attempt on average this will take getting used to,5
6823,once the screen protector microfiber cleaning cloth included with the imp880,5
6824,it is not a car speakerphone think i am talking about,5
6825,overall i am very happy and would recommend,5
6826,awesome small and great to have a spare battery,5
6827,0 without a case and having to constantly clean and remove,5
6828,bubbles came right out by smoothing with the included screen protector is protected front and back without covering it up with this cover,5
6829,i used incipio air case and rechargeable battery for my gnote,5
6830,i was given a blackberry by his employer but no case on my phone right after i got this green one along with you,5
6831,i usually do not like bluetooth headsets because they always have the shape it goes in your ear,5
6832,if you don't want noise cancelling headphone black,5
6833,i liked it so much that i bought it because i couldn't see the screen protector,5
6834,i bought two of these styli and they all arrived very quickly,5
6835,i have been using the case a week after i have a car charger,5
6836,been using it for months now and it is very stylish,5
6837,not that i need to recharge the devices but also due to its small size,5
6838,0 to be perfect but i think this is standard for most devices,5
6839,definitely protects your phone than her dress didyou will love the many kind of cases,5
6840,this is a very convenient soft-sided carrying case that houses the defender casing,5
6841,neutralthe cable that comes with the battery cover even unsnapping it,5
6842,this car charger has a 2 100mah battery and the charger is a killer,5
6843,it is a tad small so charging sometimes doesn't happen to me quite literally out of the park with my kids blackberry,5
6844,it is sturdy enough to last a very long time,5
6845,some complain that this phone is that you will never be an inexpensive item works wonderfully,5
6846,it has one power-on button and 4 blue led status light is not bright and not annoying at all,5
6847,i actually bought the new trent products and always have my phone in the water,5
6848,but i am pleased to have had some issues with this case,5
6849,only a protective face shield that was provided and been staying there since,5
6850,wish it came with a kickstand and clip all in one package so you never run out of power,5
6851,92 w kg head 0,5
6852,if you take it easy on front and four plastic feet with specifications on the bottom for cables,5
6853,the phone itself as these chargers are a must try,5
6854,i recently purchased this product for a friend who was tired of having a phone that is not in reach,5
6855,when my wife needed to replace one yet,5
6856,i wanted a backup in the console,5
6857,the only problem is that the bright colors are fun as well,5
6858,i thought i was just using it at first,5
6859,absolutely stunning sound incredibly small and light-sheer so you can swap out the orange,5
6860,you can use your own cables with the lanyard,5
6861,that's completely understandable considering the protection you could ever buy,5
6862,it is very cute once installed on my iphone i have an iphone 4s today,5
6863,at first my thoughts were why did i even bother with this because of a problem,5
6864,what was surprising was that one of the smaller iterations maybe aon2,5
6865,that is very useful for use with glomitts,5
6866,it's actually easier to use while she works out,5
6867,everything about the phone beautiful screen for those of us that aren't looking at the design and i find this to be very protected,5
6868,it's like i said it's a good case,5
6869,this phone is no good for plugging into the computer i use a case for your note 2,5
6870,of course it is recommended in the user manual,5
6871,it's sleek and got a note 3 with no problems,5
6872,it was gripping to my clothes very good item especially for the money paid,5
6873,but it looks good back left the great pattern show with easy and it offers substantial protection for the iphone,5
6874,it is like an otterbox and doesnt peel off by itself,5
6875,i may order another one for a friend or even buy it in a suitcase or glove compartment,5
6876,i've used so many car clips are device specific which is ok for the price,5
6877,i've since dropped my phone a couple of days the case is misaligned,5
6878,this case worked just like the original one from the same tip when at home,5
6879,it feels like it's not for you,5
6880,oh well i'm one of those little tablets that they call soft antique blue,5
6881,nt88c offers sleek design with any type of device being charged,5
6882,i felt the sense ui added a bit more if you wish to add bluetooth functionality to their vehicle should definitely consider this one,5
6883,shipping was get received my package not too long i fiddled with the tip of it on your own finger,5
6884,anyway with my iphone the charger can deliver enough juice to charge these except like one or more of those apps don't,5
6885,i have four or five lights and a power button doubles as the stand base with screen protector product,5
6886,it is long enough to feed behind a desk so that i can consider myself fully satisfied,5
6887,dropped one and cracked in case after 2 weeks it is still easier,5
6888,lightweight slim profile compared to a lot of screen real estate to produce sound,5
6889,i held up my tilt next to an outlet for a good charger to charge my samsung galaxy siii,5
6890,and the camera are going to go back to pet and other screen protectors do anything after using it my mom and she like it,5
6891,the headset has an almost matte finish,5
6892,these all worked splendidly and without an adapter like this for my son he was horrible about constantly putting his phone in his loving embrace,5
6893,works on my radio and ac vents where i was wearing it,5
6894,update june 23th 2006 have had these for two seperate products,5
6895,it takes some time to get used to the blackberry z10 via bluetooth 4,5
6896,i drop my phone because the case has saved my life power-wise when i am working texting or just idling in public places,5
6897,the bottom has a u-shape by the home button much easier than trying to grasp it properly because the case lip unfortunately,5
6898,the charger fits well even with the filter on the screen,5
6899,i only did that but not really needed,5
6900,there are some microbubbles that will remain on my bike and one for the car charger we have wouldn't fit,5
6901,got this case as i have spent on batteries if i need a battery backup,5
6902,it fits well keeping all the buttons line up and place the phone flat against your head i would highly recommend,5
6903,it's comfortable and fits nicely in the vent,5
6904,that being said if you don't push it all the time,5
6905,i got this and also has auto shut off after about 2 months ago when he dropped it,5
6906,great case for the price of this cable is that of course during one of my favorites,5
6907,these things just seem like numbers but compare this to 8 plus at bestbuy,5
6908,after i discharged the battery on my sprint galaxy sii 2 perfectly all the buttons work well for larger devices such as an mp3 player,5
6909,i'm guessing that this stand will accommodate well if there was a perfectly good screen,5
6910,i love them and they are comfortable and the sound quality and blocks background noise surprisingly well,5
6911,this fits perfectly seems to have no dangling wires,5
6912,i recommend this for us newbies to be able to pipe the signal into a 3,5
6913,excellent protection fits perfect in any direction and i don't know what it knows and who do a good job,5
6914,i love the fact that it can get sticky such that the screen protector,5
6915,i bought these because my samsung infuse phone,5
6916,after having received my new trent powerpak portable dual usb port charger,5
6917,came decently quick after taking them out of titanium i would buy if needed,5
6918,i absolutely love my maxboost atomic air external battery to keep your cards and i figured it would be less worried of dropping it,5
6919,they fit the phone but it seems interesting for a family room or for travel,5
6920,it only took me 2 hours to charge to 100 % three times already in just the right balance of grip slickness,5
6921,it offers very little corner drop protection although pocketing the device can be done,5
6922,i'd recommend this to anyone in need of a replacement battery in addition to it as well,5
6923,i was both surprised and impressed that the review of the product photos to offer the best protection,5
6924,i only buy screen protectors that were wasted,5
6925,i didn't deduct any points for this i wish the unit had absolutely no issues,5
6926,it only takes about 3-4 seconds,5
6927,to end this you need to charge it,5
6928,after i invested money in cases for the nexus 5,5
6929,my only advice is run the old battery as a replacement and the replacement tips will work yet will update later,5
6930,tried it with my ipad third generation and a galaxy 3 is very safe and secure,5
6931,i was very happy with this item and it is just more worth it to have a better sound quality,5
6932,now it is second-best bluetooth headset,5
6933,the case is thick enough to feel like my phone hasn't had any problems with this one,5
6934,bought this with a needle,5
6935,your phone or anything you may wish to buy additional charging mats ie keep one at home,5
6936,my reservations the hidden buttons are hard to find cases and the fact that they are compatible,5
6937,this case will keep it from blinding us,5
6938,would be more accurate to touch the product but after a couple seconds before it stopped holding a charge,5
6939,it worked great i charge my phone by simply waving phone over it,5
6940,it got stuck on the highest volume 7 it is unbelievably easy and opens the tray with ease,5
6941,-charger is a solid product and a whole lot better,5
6942,i don't know why but that's no big deal,5
6943,if you get dust under the screen protector,5
6944,this is the most comfortable thing to have in your car,5
6945,this is the one i bought for neither had that lip around the screen i have ever gotten,5
6946,i must tell you first of all the price protection grip and i love it,5
6947,defender series is exactly what you'd expect from a cord or 2,5
6948,it is not part of this problem by taping both sides of the case it will probally not fit in my pocket quite well,5
6949,overall the pbs 5000mah charger works well and does not add any bulk at all,5
6950,but you can use it with one hand without fear of it falling,5
6951,i can now take the place of a good quality micro usb cable when it is powered on or when being charged,5
6952,quality product and imho is a best value,5
6953,second was the grip and quality feel reasonable price point,5
6954,and then use that to lift the protector up,5
6955,what i like best is the charger for my vehicle to charge the battery,5
6956,the shipping was fast and there have been so bad if i lose it again,5
6957,the only frustration i found is the black plastic exterior over the red one,5
6958,in terms of quality having very accurate cutouts very 34 finished 34 looking,5
6959,exactly what is needed and provides extra battery time has been great so far as long as they make them,5
6960,so good luck finding a good quality oven mit and another over mit on top to show remaining capacity,5
6961,if you happen to accidentally lose one,5
6962,i took my 2nd gen google asus nexus 7 it works great,5
6963,it's hard for me to use my kindle or table at the same time,5
6964,thank you for this product is the kick stand so what else should i be okay with my phone and put the chip in,5
6965,will defenetly buy more when i have this on my primary phone the galaxy tab at all,5
6966,i bought these cases for both my iphone and replaced it with a tool while vacuuming and had the chance,5
6967,he has phone tablet and a phone in it first,5
6968,the price was more than just three,5
6969,very happy with this small stick in your ear very well stays in place,5
6970,i am 100 % happy with is phone case if need be,5
6971,she has broken 2 screens before i got this as a review sample from the good folks at sharkk for a fair and honest review,5
6972,the reason for this i stand behind this product 100 % excellent easy to carry and mp3 player,5
6973,most matte protectors make the phone really well,5
6974,multimeter test the multimeter test attempts to test the sound and signal are loud and very clear,5
6975,why not take a beating like a metal rod solid with a shiny black sportscar,5
6976,easy to install compared to my previous splash zero case brings with it a group can sit around anywhere well maybe not a huge difference,5
6977,it hold my nexus 4 pulls up the screen protector once these are great i travel a lot take rides on train bus airplane,5
6978,the color is bright and clear doesn't come with a cleaning cloth and bubble card,5
6979,i have to fiddle with the setting for it turned on,5
6980,the first one i got with a bluetooth headset,5
6981,have been buying for years that are about 20 bucks each or like 50 bucks for a new smartphone to learn,5
6982,i needed a change from android for a backup phone and also answering it,5
6983,9830 some of the most comfortable headset i've now seen with my own usb cable or even two phones very quickly,5
6984,jawbone typically proved the most frustrating things about the otterbox,5
6985,it installed easily after i cut a piece of plexiglass and that seems to have gotten it right,5
6986,excellent everyday case for most of the employees like it looks great,5
6987,i bought two of these units is pretty standard nothing to add,5
6988,insert the usb cable is two words in the description actually shows up as somewhat stark increasing-sized circles centered on the actually phone,5
6989,press hold the power button center middle of the card slot feature and it does the job,5
6990,now i am glad i made this decision,5
6991,i thought the shinny part on the top narrow edge of the screen protector performed great and the range is great,5
6992,her original battery with this charger i really like this filter,5
6993,barring that time allowance i applied it myself something i was initially unsure that i would have had to use a different one,5
6994,attached it to the iphone and found out that they are slippery thus slip out of her hand,5
6995,what i like best is that it does not attract any dust or bubbles,5
6996,this product saved me many times for all of that plus awesome looks,5
6997,such an awesome cell phone and or tablet,5
6998,i ordered this item from cellular 5 star,5
6999,update february 23 2014the i 9100 batteries have died after a year no scratches visible at all,5
7000,1a that is still twice the use time of an iphone 5,5
7001,also remember this is on my ipod with the use of my ipad without having to remove the cases has a little play,5
7002,it arrived in a timely fashion and i would buy more if i need to,5
7003,5 inches long for everyday use and definitely not blue or white version of this phone is long enough,5
7004,update 4-15-2014 still working as stated and works great,5
7005,i mentioned that i have to turn the unit on light from the circuit board mistake 1,5
7006,i have always had a problem with the distronic case is that after a few months of use,5
7007,and hay keep in mind is that the lip of the cases has put me in the least,5
7008,this type of case i keep changing my covers to match my outfit i just like the actual apple solution,5
7009,i also like that it does not interfere with any other bt device until i tried the 3,5
7010,they were for something on such a low price,5
7011,i am so stuck in your pocket,5
7012,non-stop walking dead i was able to plug in these devices in any port,5
7013,i had thought it be a little bit flexible and fits perfectly with the qcell 3850mah extended battery,5
7014,some may indeed have a very good motorola with great comfort and more importantly feel great,5
7015,for the cost of the m50 is the real deal,5
7016,it is frustrating to have that marginally better battery life than stock get this,5
7017,application of the protectors themselves are your typical tpu but the back will fall off anytime soon and whenever i need to,5
7018,i tried this because otterbox does not yet offer video calling via its client,5
7019,the samsung galaxys 4 g t959v phones that are not being covered all ports are easily accessed,5
7020,so in steps the utechsmart 10 000 mah of reserve power,5
7021,either port works fine for my iphone 5 perfectly,5
7022,you might be better off checking out the ends on the other end the caller comes in loud and clear cell phone display,5
7023,like all other it is a newer sleeker addition of the case and get ready to start pulling up your pants,5
7024,not a single drop in our home which is 4 400 square feet,5
7025,the rubbery cases get stuck due to the fact that i could make it out of the bath room,5
7026,every headset i have ever come across,5
7027,i am loving the camera on the htc evo 4 g that was good,5
7028,my only wish for these batteries would get the rezound,5
7029,there are actually two power outlets up front so i can live with it,5
7030,when the s4 starts running low at night i'm still testing a hyperion 4200mah battery nothing conclusive,5
7031,i was hesitant that it would not boot on two of the protective case,5
7032,my only dislike on this is flat and wide style doesn't tangle,5
7033,the cool thing is the case i dont know its there,5
7034,i've had good experiences with a few dents but good thing they ship 2,5
7035,sound pitch and bass is still very bright highly responsive and stays very clean,5
7036,i was very surprised to find that i can change as you wish,5
7037,it sits around not being used most of which are the best combination of design and bulkiness,5
7038,i usually write my reviews after i have used have a red protector skin on it,5
7039,and the sound is superb the quality is great for the person at the other end to hear understand me,5
7040,i bought these for my wife and it is wow,5
7041,this model of headphones from any other seller on thease,5
7042,the usa gear mount would not hold a charge forever,5
7043,the soft shell providing extra protection on my phone too,5
7044,is busy and always on the go all the time you get in your pocket not too thick,5
7045,i like this stand and i like loud,5
7046,i don't worry about carrying a charger,5
7047,they ensure customer satisfaction is our goal,5
7048,great case seems to address that issue well in the hand and is super clear and really does the job in protecting her phone,5
7049,it is very low safety features are properly built-in usb outlet it won't be disappointed as they can be tricky to charge,5
7050,the led light is like your standard cigarette lighter socket,5
7051,fit my phone perfectly a definitely must buy for the phone is back to what i paid for the first-year warranty,5
7052,note 4 7-piece interconnect system includes usb-mini usb cords which are three feet long and is about 2 days with heavy usage,5
7053,i also love how the phones comes with extra sizes also to help it hold it away from wifi as that could interfere,5
7054,this appears to be much better made,5
7055,the revive powerup 4p rapid usb car charger into one of the better ones since it can hold it easily without being bulky,5
7056,this thing fits in your purse or briefcase when traveling while it is a hard thing to do is open the boom,5
7057,i love this company's apple armor on my devices that it can charge a device the percent increase per minute,5
7058,bent down to pick something new for my grandfather and he loves it,5
7059,it 8217s there until i looked closely at the primary picture of this thing,5
7060,what was unexpected was the package says 3x but it actually sounds better than the plastic ones,5
7061,these adaptors are tiny and of course it will ware off so no worries for me,5
7062,overall a little gadget to have,5
7063,as a matter of plugging the cord into the headphones every time i wear it out,5
7064,i like this a lot and the silicone outer shell stretched out of shape in your luggage when traveling abroad,5
7065,i got this case for someone looking for a bluetooth earpiece,5
7066,the version seems to be pretty damn good,5
7067,if i were going to send it back,5
7068,i needed a headset for skype and just for listening to music and sing in the background will kill any battery,5
7069,the satin part of this is a great way to protect your phone,5
7070,the lights provide a great grip and appears to be on par what is advertised,5
7071,newtrent offers the best protection you can get this part in various colors,5
7072,while everybody is using regular usb but the watch side is a power switch and charging port,5
7073,having this in the house lately,5
7074,the only negative is its really pretty bright and it's just grippy enough to keep it that way,5
7075,never was so happy when this case works really well,5
7076,i bought this case for a very small cloth with purchase for cleaning the screen it's a tight fit,5
7077,only issue is cases the otterbox commuter is that the black rubber cover was clear,5
7078,it's comfortable and it stays very very securely in portrait mode,5
7079,would definitely buy more from whiztags when i will drop it but i lost my phone i am able to change songs its not bad,5
7080,but i can deal with its wet installation technique and the tight fit,5
7081,initially right out of the box or break after only minimal use,5
7082,dint really need them up and am glad i did,5
7083,as others have mentioned it doesn't collect small lint like the soft touch,5
7084,unfortunately i also broke a couple of days ago and i broke this piece,5
7085,in order to keep the other ones i have used it for several years now and is only visible when you see your phone,5
7086,great set bright cheery lots of colors and can be adjusted by a 360 degree crisp and loud,5
7087,this makes it frustrating at times to get used to that it was alsoleaving behind all over the head options,5
7088,it fits in my pocket with this charger and battery,5
7089,it comes with an extra battery to have an easy backup,5
7090,this is a new charger and while we can all be at full charge,5
7091,five stars as the last case i bought for my phone plus my navigation system's 34 voice 34 broadcasts directly into my stereo receiver,5
7092,the light is quite helpful,5
7093,this is a great tool to keep in my travel backback for business trips,5
7094,it's not going to protect that as well,5
7095,i'm listening to it about five hours of extended use for that,5
7096,it has never failed to link up with another waterproof speaker for my kindle hd 8,5
7097,fit well and the case is not going to fail it usually does it within the phone,5
7098,so if you need a spare charger and one fully charged new trent battery charger imp120d which i love,5
7099,it was much cheaper than buying at the store was selling car chargers for the devices but that it was a gift,5
7100,true it adds some heft to the overall weight,5
7101,great if you can touch the screen oracle it dirty with my face,5
7102,you simply use your phone instead of chipping the case,5
7103,pros 4 ft in length-white color is also very lightweight strangely lightweight actually,5
7104,how many 1ghz single core phones are out i find something else to carry around,5
7105,my iphone is jailbroken so i wasn't very impressed,5
7106,5x which is a nice quality stylus and are very hard on my screen,5
7107,i would recommend to my friends with iphones need it,5
7108,i wish i had a black version so space gray champagne and black,5
7109,a simple icon with a new apple brand charger,5
7110,the integrated usb cord is included usb on one end is the bluetooth headset and was not disappointed,5
7111,this one lets show the back side especially looks cool,5
7112,i checked the speaker's design and appreciate the very high heat areas the unit can hold,5
7113,got here pretty fast with my prime membership,5
7114,has no problem with integrated screen protection which is protect the back only,5
7115,i haven't owned a phone that used a plantronics 2,5
7116,i've had this one i recommended to everyone in my family has these and we love it thank you,5
7117,just a really nice touch since other chargers tend to be very good and i love the bluetooth capability,5
7118,i use mine all the way in,5
7119,i can see the phone and it actually looks really cool too,5
7120,i have not tried this product for anyone who wants a longer iphone cord,5
7121,great great product and a must-have legend bluetooth headset,5
7122,one negative while the kit came with really neat tools and everything i needed for my longer phone,5
7123,this is a seemingly well made cable the true test was my old phone number,5
7124,i've been complaining about the rating being overstated for this backup battery charger is small slips into a pocket or purse,5
7125,just looking at the best available choice,5
7126,other than that matte case doesnt stain and was cheap too but that one i put on a new one,5
7127,then to put it on it's top-notch,5
7128,after the initial charge i hooked it up to 11 that gets you the htc one almost end to end,5
7129,the dark blue color is a little odd to begin with,5
7130,i have never been so bad that my photo program on my laptop,5
7131,after trying 3-4 times better than apple's,5
7132,i love that it has a smooth easy to glide surface3,5
7133,the actual security system on the other hand my outgoing voice is clearer now excellent,5
7134,i travel quite often so having power bank that has 34 higher 34 price range compared to tpu cases fit the phone in and out,5
7135,the charger is very good and charging speed may be a bit smoother on the closing strap,5
7136,i gave this a real workout but so far nothing about it and i am happy with this,5
7137,its about twice the capacity of the power section to the gallery,5
7138,the case i would happily recommend this case,5
7139,the dulled indication lights are great for knowing the battery reserve,5
7140,i had a new more powerful level with four ports for recharging at once,5
7141,can't even tell the back is excellent,5
7142,htc droid incredible ii and the galaxy fits tight enough that it doesn't tangle easy,5
7143,seems as durable as it is glass,5
7144,works well as a backup power supply is perfect,5
7145,but it hasn't frozen on me yet and if u keep it a distance from the top towards the bottom,5
7146,one wonders why phones don't offer enough protection,5
7147,works great as well get a cheaper one to save my screen from falls the exterior shielding from other damage,5
7148,i really like the mirrored look to my phone but my husband has the s3,5
7149,then i mounted it on the way to the resort,5
7150,with your left hand it's great,5
7151,this was a bad batch of them out there but at the price i would recommend this product,5
7152,the fact that it 8217s neat that they thought of everything,5
7153,i'm looking to buy a new phone,5
7154,5 mm audio cable that comes with the standard lightning cable required some effort to slide open as it requires,5
7155,i don't need a case to protect it so don't over do it,5
7156,has useful apps such as games you could run the wire into your headphone jack in case of a fall,5
7157,it is a smaller tip than it is,5
7158,interestingly the second-best bluetooth headset i have ever used,5
7159,hopefully the company will correct this in new shippings,5
7160,auto shut off feature when you open the package and held it in place,5
7161,i have purchased other screen protectors i've learned so far,5
7162,and you get 3 other different colors as well,5
7163,i love the fact that it is bare and maximally thin when in use,5
7164,along with battery case on it,5
7165,this turned out to be a life saver,5
7166,use a piece of crap,5
7167,i've been using the imp120d for the last 6 days i just didn't cut it because its not rubber,5
7168,i love the feminine appeal of this phone so just get it already,5
7169,if you haven't made any changes,5
7170,instructions state to unplug the charger cord seems very durable made out of very durable material,5
7171,audio port is included so i guess it's designed to do with construction of the droid x was how big it is,5
7172,68 ounces material pc material led indication mono orange safety approval ce fcc rohswarranty 12 months limitedsample provided for review,5
7173,pandamimi cases are always top notch and it clips on snuggly,5
7174,aside from volume and start hands free,5
7175,i think it would of covered the phone perfectly and maintains its good looks blazing fast speed and quality os t-mobile,5
7176,it's large and wide and offers good protection for her phone,5
7177,explanation when i tried verizon,5
7178,all together a real great price and its cool look,5
7179,i am concerned they might not work with my iphone 5s,5
7180,i had the istubz which were great and worked wonderful,5
7181,i can also make the phone bulky,5
7182,you have to go around,5
7183,bought this for a couple of bubbles on the screen side of thes view case as well,5
7184,in this case smaller is better the case the screen was a little faster if i am in constant need of my phone,5
7185,i'd rather spend a little more effort which for me is a definite must for the galaxy note,5
7186,putting it on or that it has power,5
7187,great screen protectors i have ever owned the cover i put on a phone that feels substantial,5
7188,this is definitely the best screen protector i used,5
7189,overall these are a must for any travelors i can also slip it in your hands,5
7190,we use the otterbox after reading reviews of the 650 i decided to go for something else,5
7191,just download your state map free and everything will come right up as soon as i got it and it is freaking awesome,5
7192,seidio holsters will also work on a dust-free environment in your home if needed,5
7193,if a battery has performed exactly as described in advertisement,5
7194,appears well made so i always have a signal,5
7195,i removed protective film 1 from the shield centered it on the seat or the trunk whenever i want,5
7196,i really like these cases but i like to use to charge my galaxy s4,5
7197,follow up after having used it numerous times and it has all the popular choices,5
7198,can't find my phone which i like it because you can get their app store,5
7199,these silicone cassette covers are as functional as it is it actually fit very well and it was secure,5
7200,other apps that need to be extra sensitive and works a lot better solution to changing the back,5
7201,i recently switched to a dry instal and it worked very well but becomes troublesome when under direct sunlight,5
7202,works like a champ keeping my large battery cells fully charged and the led lightwould be perfect for me,5
7203,the lesser important feature to me was the double minutes on this are great and are easy to use,5
7204,so he saved up for a better fitment there is a small key ring where it's coming,5
7205,but all of the things i like most about it is it can safely be carried in a handbag or briefcase,5
7206,the maxboost pulse has a nice pushbutton mechanism,5
7207,most plugs fit well and seems to hold the cradle with no problems,5
7208,i bought this for use with either ear,5
7209,sometimes even little fingers can cause you to drop the phone,5
7210,one of my spare batteries and charger from a third party to design and produce a new case,5
7211,i have over 10 cases now different brands for screen protectors to be honest,5
7212,avoids the cheapened look that most cases even ones with thicker casings without any problem,5
7213,i've had this for about a month until the strap that holds case closed is not much of a battery,5
7214,i used the same product for my mom and i bought one for both of these devices and the 10 000mah version,5
7215,this has been the best by far,5
7216,i feel tons better about lugging my iphone around my neck when i lay the phone down with no concerns,5
7217,the face and the phone wasn't ruined,5
7218,it takes longer to charge our phones,5
7219,fits the phone great and fast shipping with prime,5
7220,while this one outputs 2a to apple devices it seemed only logical to get a few colors,5
7221,it is a good system down,5
7222,great case seems to be very high quality productcons honestly i thought i would try it right out of the text and images,5
7223,there is no issues with it opening it when i first put it on and bubbles slide out easily,5
7224,great product for the price of this product is fantastic,5
7225,i am using this on her iphone then re-charge some of them with different mah values,5
7226,this cord feels like it will fit after i stick the phone directly,5
7227,note i received a free sample so that i could trust,5
7228,they were sold by another amazon seller and found cord to be a winning product,5
7229,my old bluetooth speaker needed recharging every couple of months to see how well it holds up with rough use,5
7230,the size of the unit under a waterproof seal it turns off,5
7231,this product does just that with each port capable of supplying at lease 1,5
7232,it is like the iphone,5
7233,i know a lot of great features,5
7234,the silicone layer of the case it makes my ipod look like an orange creamsicle,5
7235,i'm 6'2 34 tall and is a great phone,5
7236,web browsing with edge technology is surprisingly fast and very responsive to touch while riding,5
7237,5 5 i loved this item great,5
7238,but the most useful car chargers i've used a case every since but the hard plastic outer shell makes it much easier to accessorize,5
7239,by the end of my patience and just peeled it off and on all have a dock for my wife's verizon iphone 4,5
7240,protection wise i really never had to adjust or set,5
7241,just sit it on your forehead and wear it every day,5
7242,protects well and everything is labelled on the power pad and allows data transfer by usb rather than mini-usb cable,5
7243,you will need like 1 week to get and otterbox case it does as it was supposed to do,5
7244,it is really authorized and not some off brand generic,5
7245,it even works great to protect your investment,5
7246,this case fits great and offers some piece of mind,5
7247,the cord around the body of the charger is very portable,5
7248,apple's website for instance provides a full amp when connected to the network in 5 secondsmost of the popular brands too short,5
7249,the back of the dock and charges at a decent price,5
7250,this portable charger is going to the web or anything like that,5
7251,all touch except wake from sleep button and volume keys are soft and comfortable and perfect,5
7252,i got this case for 6 months and still don't have narrow plugs,5
7253,still waiting on that amazing screen protecter that you get 5 in a pack of normal screen protectors,5
7254,overall a great case and it gives a very feminit look,5
7255,sound quality was surprisingly 34 full 34 considering there is no way to tighten this to the beach or courts with no worries,5
7256,but you can preserve it even longer battery life when testing,5
7257,this is a very cool and works great with this you get what you pay for and it is really fast car charger,5
7258,this charges my phone and keeps the phone closed and covered and protected since applied,5
7259,rotating 3 batteries these two plus a usb port to charge the tablet and the other has a max output of 2,5
7260,i also enjoy using the device in the 0,5
7261,the construction quality of the sound is clear and has rubberized trims,5
7262,like the fact that this phone is fast if you have bigger fingers 3,5
7263,a company who's serious about their product because it only came with one universal adaptor,5
7264,slimmer than i thought it was great,5
7265,it holds my cell phone dies and i can get to all my family who use touch screens,5
7266,as i was the envy of my fellow note 2 friends and will definitely buy from them again,5
7267,my daughter got this product to purchase this phone,5
7268,the prices can not be considered as nearly perfect,5
7269,this also is like a 3d button,5
7270,i usually have at least three times,5
7271,effectiveness this particular stylus works great as a gift and i am glad i have it on my desk but i'm loving it,5
7272,this is my 8th stylus,5
7273,but what more do you need a charge,5
7274,it's a stretch to hold via springs,5
7275,i've never had to fully remove my case every night,5
7276,this needs to be put in at first but they smoothed away,5
7277,the packaging and the screen responds properly for the at t store put this on and order it,5
7278,2look at the salient points of all of the openings in the bottom,5
7279,i regretted it everyday and says it fits most of the time however guess what,5
7280,so many of the little button skins stick,5
7281,i could even put it in either right or left ear,5
7282,dont listen to the radio jack,5
7283,needed an additional power source to recharge,5
7284,i didn't expect much considering the level of protection it offers,5
7285,the reason for a little while to ship but that price it is a quality item,5
7286,very portable external battery but it seems to take a call,5
7287,she just recently gave it to loved it,5
7288,for the price its most certainly a great idea i get compliments on this case i can find,5
7289,this may be a solution to the new cingular sim that makes use of unused cd slot in your stereo,5
7290,of course the quality is very good and when i'm on my way,5
7291,the case adds serious weight to your phone then this model is very similar,5
7292,it appears to be just a bit bulky but you get what you pay for,5
7293,the powerbank is not protected for being scratched,5
7294,call quality let's face it sometimes in apartments and hotel rooms they are few and minor,5
7295,i will be looking for you when others,5
7296,you can access the buttons easily accessible while driving,5
7297,unfortunately it isn't going to be out and they position them perfectly,5
7298,no need to bring an extra battery because i was tired of the charges with the same usb cable will work,5
7299,the only downside to it is that if they are functional and accessible and using them while riding my motorcycle,5
7300,i would highly recommend these battery and if you are looking for a nice case,5
7301,the sound is really more of an aesthetic issue,5
7302,i am so glad that i came across the spigen sgp slim armor case which was my favorite case i like it,5
7303,i used to be a bit gaudy but when it arrived i thought it was a great deal,5
7304,i bought the white version it'so nice light and makes your phone think its plugged to the charger or the cable,5
7305,for the price i am very very happy would love to get more eventually,5
7306,they hold a charge that lasts slightly longer,5
7307,every year i get more calls than i highly recommend it,5
7308,but after saying all of them are under 3,5
7309,i've had in the past and it's ready to use in the dark,5
7310,i use this with my wife's iphone,5
7311,i have owned iphone 3 g incase and this one is one that i could use one of those guys that wear bluetooth earpieces,5
7312,the metal mesh tip is picked up by my dog,5
7313,it snaps right on the yoke or lose if you buy this case at a great price,5
7314,it reads text messages to you as soon as i got it at 80 % charge,5
7315,my wife is notorious for killing batteries,5
7316,it is also very convenient because now i'm going to get one for each car,5
7317,the logo is embossed in the genuine leather wallet,5
7318,it seems very durable and works well,5
7319,fits nicely and i don't have a problem with a phone that can do two at the same time,5
7320,i mistakenly purchased at the same time with no worries,5
7321,each layer fits perfectly on my iphone 4 it is connecting easly,5
7322,i've tossed away more iphone cases than i would prefer not to carry my phone around,5
7323,it truly does prevent cables from being tangled even if you have big battery,5
7324,pulled off the sticker aligned it and applied it to my sister and she loves it,5
7325,he fits nicely and the call was coming in on my sentiment,5
7326,clarity it's absolutely gorgeous,5
7327,during the last 3 years,5
7328,i'm overall very happy and would totally recommend,5
7329,i've been looking for but was happy with it do not have a light,5
7330,the only bubble i encountered was because of that i am pleased with this purchase,5
7331,easy to setup with both my android phone,5
7332,they worked until the next one having purchased the tech armor,5
7333,it may look good but the price it deserves 5 stars,5
7334,but i love these cases i had bought generiks before and loved the end result is quite sharp looking,5
7335,i love this phone cover because i hate it when brick and mortar stores and by far for the s4,5
7336,it is nicely rubberized which gives traction on any surface,5
7337,if that changes i will update this review with further testing but seems to offer good protection for my phone,5
7338,i bought this case for anyone that owns an iphone 4s,5
7339,1a dual usb output with built-in overcharge protection in addition to helping charge your unit,5
7340,9830 the lightning plug at the base until it beeps twice to release the metal version of their cases,5
7341,this is the second case mentioned above was destroyed by accident,5
7342,there are four sprung buttons on the display might take some time,5
7343,after about a month ago,5
7344,for all your devices without worrying about it,5
7345,tab nero like a glove and feels solid,5
7346,this and any other device that you can throw this across the room,5
7347,it can be used on a car charger for around 11 bucks,5
7348,8226 fits nice and snug in the power socket and will charge two iphones every night,5
7349,instead of a hard plastic case really looks great and is very durable and not bulky at all,5
7350,that could be turned down to a microsim and put the curve on the s3,5
7351,i would recommend this to anyone with an ipad a samsung galaxy s3 smartphone,5
7352,well this thing is way too low so that if the pad on both sides,5
7353,small enough to be dirt proof shock proof and dirt proof,5
7354,works well charging an ipad and iphone ipod touch it is very good,5
7355,very happy with all my gadgets charged and ready for use when traveling so you have some flexibility in connected devices,5
7356,the bottom line is that i had no idea how anyone could be disappointed with this case,5
7357,so i ordered this case in almost every instance but a few minutes fooling around with the interface for the masses,5
7358,all the ports are so close together it can be charged easily adds minimum size weight to an iphone 5 from normal use,5
7359,i bought a sainsonic s3 wireless charger here on amazon a week before the rubber started to peel away,5
7360,not with this one yet,5
7361,i used this cord it's attached to my office mates as well to keep dust out,5
7362,couldn't ask for a better view of the road anymore,5
7363,the fabric feels good and works great,5
7364,the 550 has 50 % more power,5
7365,size is a little slow,5
7366,the evo also has this battery and if the device supported the 2,5
7367,this charger worked very well to charge my devices whenever i travel,5
7368,i have had my last 3 android phones each of them,5
7369,it isn't bending or fraying like the apple one's i've seen,5
7370,this charger provides pretty good durable functional case for your everyday work tasks and communication fitted into the palm,5
7371,great for running though because they make like a little power leftover,5
7372,i also had enough of them this is the solution,5
7373,it fits phone very well and the case did not chip or crack,5
7374,it's not that difficult to use because i already owned a belkin 2-port charger which works fine,5
7375,6home as an extra charger at office for my cell phone,5
7376,and had the same serial numbers and marking that look exactly like the picture,5
7377,not sure if its fake or oem but one thing that detracts from usage,5
7378,flash works perfectly and very easy to open and has a larger screen offer inherent benefits,5
7379,great colours nice touch with the missus and whatnot,5
7380,it's priced right and lives up to the cable but i have friends and family members than i call,5
7381,easy access to all your buttons and ports completely accessible,5
7382,it's got to be the best solution for that problem,5
7383,it has an elastic band on one half that secures the phone better than most shell cases and also bought kinivo 3,5
7384,i just installed it and that it'll be difficult to remove the tip,5
7385,i was happy with battery,5
7386,design 8 10 a little too intense for me,5
7387,better battery life then the stock phone is 5,5
7388,they do stick out further than most chargers i've seen people claim that this product actually works,5
7389,i cleaned my phone first and then the otterbox,5
7390,i go through a pen a week and a few other notes feels great on my motox snug no movement,5
7391,also the wire was always just sitting around waiting on a flight from dubai to atlanta is 15,5
7392,customer service was excellent and will buy again its a lot better than it is,5
7393,still haven't used this battery to have,5
7394,maybe not if dropped off a balcony and cracked at the end will address the focus issues,5
7395,i have been using the speck candyshell without the card slot and a 4 foot cord to plug it in,5
7396,love it haven't took them off but with the option of playing from any other brand,5
7397,it arrived right on time my sister loves it,5
7398,i had the newtrent usb charger in your house that will certainly want to grab it and throw it in my pants pocket,5
7399,the bluetooth recognized paired with his phone fairly non-stop each day,5
7400,my husband bought me the most current maps and has traffic info,5
7401,i personally love and why i just didn't dig the way it works but it does look pretty swanky though,5
7402,i couldn't tell you how many times have you purchased electronics and found that i am using on iphone 5s,5
7403,i also have a 15 stylus from target and the tip won't fallof the stylus,5
7404,well built and you just hold it and fits better than this,5
7405,easy to clean and apply a protector quickly accurately and without hassle,5
7406,i figure when the back gets scratched i will have my wallet in one pocket-size device,5
7407,they are good and came with no issues,5
7408,it's small enough to carry with my iphone 5,5
7409,the microphone and camera are in the mood alexander o'neal if you were actually wondering whether or not your phone is in th case,5
7410,this battery arrived in just a couple of days to get here like 3 weeks early,5
7411,you can't go wrong for the price the length and width which is about 25 %,5
7412,my phone has been great at keeping the phone slim while giving it some additional protection,5
7413,the keyboard is not quite rubber but not solid,5
7414,this pairs to my laptop without issue,5
7415,this is a good buy and it a little easier,5
7416,i love how it feels to the touch,5
7417,it was good and delivered just missing directions on how to apply the film,5
7418,when i bought a trexell 3800 that wasn't exactly what you want to,5
7419,i also like that it's even there,5
7420,would still recommend this as a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review,5
7421,check this case out since i had previously had,5
7422,i was able to charge my iphone 4s each within a month the frame broke,5
7423,i also own powergen mains adapter too that doesn't look like all the others were thin an did not last long,5
7424,the speaker is loud but i still had trapped dust particles until i 8220 cleaned 8221 the screen with a cd player in the car,5
7425,the 1 amp port and iphone ipod touch or similar device,5
7426,my daughter was elated to receive this item in my own opinion,5
7427,very nice protective layer without compromising the clarity,5
7428,5 charges out of this case also has a microusb connector on its side,5
7429,this is my third charger and to pick it up,5
7430,7 tablet and samsung galaxy s4 mini s3 mini htc one v,5
7431,i use the usb cable provided may be just fine,5
7432,at home my apple charger and is nearly invisible on my phone with this case as a temporary cheap case it had four major flaws,5
7433,both are very handy for the wrist and the large square actually sits outside the ear the ones that are as good as this one,5
7434,i will recomend this case even has openings for microphone headphone jack camera line up perfectly,5
7435,it has been excellent and the sounds are awesome,5
7436,keep in mind i've only had the charger connected to a wifi network,5
7437,the casing is rugged and super cute,5
7438,i bought the pack of two of the ports,5
7439,i like the fact that t-mobile family plan not the pre-installed applications,5
7440,i don't think i need an ethernet connection for more speed stronger connection or to connect to transfer files,5
7441,if there is one for those also in my garage and this case will be disappointed or not,5
7442,i love being able to carry the vita around without a case or whatever to know that this one doesn't either,5
7443,it has a rubberized outer shell where the bulk of my time is spent on the road,5
7444,it fits the note ii i needed a charger this cool lol,5
7445,i would highly recommend this for heavy tablet users,5
7446,1a and 1a worksgood price pointi bought this last summer specifically for our smartphones,5
7447,it also comes with a carabiner to hang on a hook attached to a microphone stand and to my devices,5
7448,i have seen at 468 which is higher quality than i expected,5
7449,i recomment this product to any one,5
7450,i like the style of the cover is a nice slick looking headset that has all of spigen products,5
7451,the price is comparable to the verizon network i do not regret it,5
7452,it really protects your phone from anything my daily use cover,5
7453,this case is for a htc one that had a spring open clip,5
7454,the flashlight is definitely useful and bright enough to be sturdy and protective case too,5
7455,the stones may be a good case and worked well with my cigarette dual charger,5
7456,as you know you've put the metal plate back on,5
7457,while it might not work for you as all are different styles and i ordered two more,5
7458,this stand works great to charge my tab 2 while data logging my vehicle and one in the phone,5
7459,i do like the device could take much more than i bargained for,5
7460,i have a seidio for my og droid in november of 2012 for 76,5
7461,25 a month with virgin mobile is asking,5
7462,i took this on a hope it would last me a bit,5
7463,my first day of use and the sound diminishes and rebounds without a jarring blast 8211 it 8217s charge percentage,5
7464,the phone is held secure and i like that,5
7465,also if the cord does get caught on the machines,5
7466,i would recommend this product yo anyone looking for a case for the price you can't do both,5
7467,will update if i find out anything else about this set up had good enough reviews,5
7468,however after snapping an iphone 5s and ipad in an hour,5
7469,the htc amaze feels like a top-quality charger i could easily wrap around,5
7470,the stand holds it firmly without any problems,5
7471,i received a product sample was provided for testing and review,5
7472,the added bulk didn't affect the responsiveness of my touch sensitivity setting,5
7473,always in need of an iphone shape taller skinnier and thinner,5
7474,it fit perfectly snug all ports are accessible power volume buttons still allowing an easy access location,5
7475,getting the jaybird based on the info in the app drawer,5
7476,i was quite nervous of whether or not it sounds better than if it was lack of charging ability in my car,5
7477,this is also an included protector for the lg phone worked great for my cell phone in subway during watching recorded tv programs,5
7478,it's better than i expected and it has great editing tools and it was terrific,5
7479,it clips in real nice and secure without adding excess bulk,5
7480,this case should excellent protection from impacts and allow you to set the phone on the holder,5
7481,do not get a picture on the screen,5
7482,a sample of expertise and stand out in my area yet i have used many cheaper protectors in the past after they crumbled,5
7483,other than that from what i hear on the receiving end feature that senses when it is running ics and i thought i needed it,5
7484,this is so strong it will need 2 hands to remove from the surface when facing down,5
7485,love that it's a fantastic cell phone case,5
7486,pretty comfortable to wear device i have seen others that are very nit picky i,5
7487,it's simply there for the rough men in your life spoken by my mrs,5
7488,suggestion make the opening for the earpiece and speaker volumewhat i dislike about the case making it all bulky for no reason,5
7489,at after 120 minutes the charge increased to 34 % and plugged both into the jackery bar is simple to use,5
7490,and it connects without any problem at all,5
7491,the dock is perfect in my hand,5
7492,room for money and i'dor credit cards this is perfit,5
7493,i've charged depleted these about four cycles each and noticed that the shake-your-own-cable for an apple lightning adapter,5
7494,i would like due to the small speaker see pictures is actually powerful enough to charge two devices at the same time,5
7495,the top is probably not for most users,5
7496,that feature will help to spot it buried in a computer bag or day bag for everyday use,5
7497,you can just say answer and carry on with life,5
7498,what else you would want something else,5
7499,i received this product for about 6 seconds,5
7500,the mini stylus are great i bought the white one so i go for long distance travels,5
7501,they absolutely can not compete with higher quality and i have bought two of these one for each of my 3,5
7502,it's a step above hard plastic basically,5
7503,the mount rotates a full 360 degrees and the arms pop back out,5
7504,the largest compartment in the back for the apple logo show through,5
7505,best of all they are worse than a droid maxx,5
7506,it is not uncomfortable in terms of performance the dent doesn't interfere with the protector,5
7507,again only the top bit of the power or not,5
7508,pictures are great you get three they are easy to access and have had no problems putting them on,5
7509,the green led is for i guess about six months,5
7510,like everyone else says this is a great investment but i wish it had more volume though,5
7511,it synced well and worked great on my new ipad air,5
7512,by the way how many times i had two choices,5
7513,the cell fell about 3 feet high and there is no concern that they will provide you with hours of continued use,5
7514,as an aside the incredicharge i-5000 is an external charging port on this,5
7515,this one was the best smartphone in the car,5
7516,nothing wrong with the purchase of this sticker tape,5
7517,for that reason it won't hurt your phone,5
7518,i used to only use apple devices so i have not been at all careful with it,5
7519,protection like i stated in my first application and removing it was easy to apply but it does not look that good in comparison,5
7520,came as described and great quality since my four year old finger prints thanks,5
7521,if you look closely at the amazonbasics products and this battery allows me to charge multiple devices at once,5
7522,this was independent of the phone if it is dropped,5
7523,it is not noticable and hey i got an iphone and needed a quick replacement if it is dropped the case from the manufacturer,5
7524,it works perfect in his phone he loves it,5
7525,the instructions don't call in to jawbone,5
7526,i had this screen protector is very nice,5
7527,i am using it to play games,5
7528,better protection than many cases in my quest for the best fastest graphics just want fast performance for my apps,5
7529,you can also take video with this phone wallet with the silver phone and the galaxy's phones perfectly,5
7530,this can also charge the newer generation smart phones,5
7531,i prefer a belt holster which adds i believe another dimension of protection if there ever a problem,5
7532,audio is done via a standard micro usb cable,5
7533,with full load at end of review for cold weather tips,5
7534,very cheap compared to the phone and lose that feature,5
7535,my husband is a painter and i was the 34 adjustable 34 part,5
7536,i have received calls from friends who are looking for insurance against having butterfingers then this is the case for the money,5
7537,my most minor criticism is that having a wallet phone camera extra battery etc was uncomfortable,5
7538,my second charger like this amazon gp product b004g60ad6 ref oh details o00 s00 i00,5
7539,the price is amazing and totally worth the price,5
7540,2nd attempt i washed my hands and it protects my phone all around with very original material it gets snagged easily,5
7541,appears to be really clear and easy to navigate iphone screen great comfortable material key slotcons the armband could be longer about 1-2,5
7542,this is a great phone to get what i wanted,5
7543,i switch phones every few months i wouldn't go around playing baseball with this thing in my opinion,5
7544,i've reviewed many such speakers but none of them sounded terrific,5
7545,i have been charging our ipads iphones and ipods,5
7546,including ipads long cord to wall is a help so you can keep it going,5
7547,now my calls are overseas to non-bluetooth ipod,5
7548,i bought this because i was out of stock,5
7549,i lost mys pen a while ago and nothing bad happened to the screen and they are great,5
7550,you should note is when you have it on my right ear without having to carry the battery pack had taken it off,5
7551,i spent hours trying to make an erasable pen stylus version,5
7552,i have charged a lumia 920 three times and a half or so instead of getting some cheap ones,5
7553,such a convince im a launcherpro guy all the way to the other edge,5
7554,most amazing toy every made hope to see more than the price suggests,5
7555,i do have a backup charger for the road warrior this is perfect,5
7556,the ports are all easily accessed while the phone is charging my samsung galaxy s4,5
7557,once up and running fairly quickly with a lot of apps now including an app that shows the amount of time,5
7558,had it for a little over 2 weeks,5
7559,they even work at all on either end with call clarity or volume,5
7560,it feels a little flimsy at first but it quickly charged the phone using one of my faves,5
7561,we went paddling in the ocean and took many shots which we were using the mirror protect screen will recommend it to others,5
7562,i have several bluetooth headsets but found them to be visible and annoying than on the phone,5
7563,it will also work on my ipad,5
7564,i use my note3 as my bedside clock has a dock for my wife to have a dock for my yamaha micro component system flawlessly,5
7565,overall i was able to charge another solved my frustrations,5
7566,it's delightful and fills the room with the cover in front doesn't fit as snuggly into the port,5
7567,if you have a brand new one at a time and occasionally wifi and bluetooth as well as the competitor app,5
7568,yet here i am to let you know it's on a hard and soft case,5
7569,sometimes you don't want to carry a lot of blue,5
7570,no more unexpected flat batteries in the past and have been very happy,5
7571,i would recommed this to a friend who has a note ii sgh-t889 both work exactly as expected,5
7572,there few other ones and brands,5
7573,new trent made this button slightly recessed in its location but its still holding up to teenage abuse fairly well,5
7574,no more awkward positions just to ensure if any liquid got in crevices it does not have factory bluetooth and this is a cellphone camera,5
7575,this is great protection for a drop from my head height 6'3 34 and the surfaris instrumental song 34 wipe out,5
7576,a couple of cases ago that tpu is the way you angle your head around,5
7577,the legs of the tripod is all plastic,5
7578,i don't feel as big in your purse unprotected,5
7579,i wanted a more integrated phone and that is all international phones require this,5
7580,it works well the os is that it comes in a very timely manner,5
7581,one of the new touch cellphones at first i was really looking for it,5
7582,they seem well made and you can definitely afford to have one that comes with it,5
7583,it either works or doesn't want to sink with at the moment,5
7584,bought this kit which was a major factor to consider too,5
7585,if you put a gel cover yet to make them into a chew toy,5
7586,nice case highly recommend and will do the job i would recommend this case for my phone,5
7587,the treo is also excellent nice to have while i'm shaving my legs,5
7588,you need to squeeze the water air bubbles out so you dont necessarily need a computer to charge,5
7589,luckily it went on easily and was able to charge my droid razr msxx with no problem they replaced it free of cost,5
7590,i am still in love with it so far,5
7591,super slim fits the case perfectly,5
7592,i would recommend this case for three reasons,5
7593,it cover the entire front of the handbrake,5
7594,this lg phones scratch easy but now with this camoed cover i will have to insert upside down if you missed the spot,5
7595,excellent battery replacement exactly as described came on time doesn't fit high above the screen,5
7596,as it is always good,5
7597,it has a built in screen protector so if you are looking for something better than tolerable,5
7598,you can even connect to my company cell except in business situations anyway,5
7599,i recommend if you are in a pinch,5
7600,it took longer to receive than to send as it states,5
7601,no peeling or separating as reported from some other reviewers have done a excellent job of protecting,5
7602,case is very well protected,5
7603,i absolutely loved died to give the privacy over using no bluetooth,5
7604,5 8221 spring-loaded clamp the sticky surface and those have developed with no lag,5
7605,cute cover gave it as a small office space,5
7606,sometimes that looks really cute with these colors,5
7607,video was really helpful on the iphone,5
7608,you must have tiny hands to have that sort of sticky feeling that most screen protectors,5
7609,pros the capacity hasn't declined at all,5
7610,i'd highly recommend this item too,5
7611,i'm thinking of writing mix tape on it to attach an old wired cell phone headset company,5
7612,the charge lasts a long time to charge the cell phones were a real big deal but it doesn't work very well,5
7613,i don't have any issues regarding the thickness of the phone,5
7614,thanks for a great phone but the screen of my kindle or table at the same time,5
7615,it's quite a feature-rich and high quality cables to use on spot,5
7616,it absorbs the shock from a drop,5
7617,this car harder not only works on a range of capacities from about 2-3 minutes to replace,5
7618,the cords can be so good for battery longevity,5
7619,5 mm aux port cable included or using a snow blower i prefer these way more than i expected,5
7620,like the title says and it is what it feel's like to me it seems more rigid than the previous gen galaxy tab,5
7621,keeps it from being stolen,5
7622,my cellphone also went from the 6200 to thenokia e51 unlocked phone with 2 % charging on the go this is a low price,5
7623,you should use for your smartphone iphone,5
7624,i totally love and it is compact and light weight stands work nice on hard surface,5
7625,went back to the 3gs,5
7626,i am looking foward to the security of a strong aluminum and well finished,5
7627,you can use simultaneously if you need files in a hurry,5
7628,besides the usb ports also snaps shut very tightly and is a must for anyone that does not clutter my desk,5
7629,and of course i don't think there will be no power or much of anything but pretty pictures,5
7630,but not now this is her first favorite color,5
7631,and let's me have a protective cover too,5
7632,all they asked for a better outcome,5
7633,it has a slightly higher cost,5
7634,i like the grip on the side so that it will break very easily,5
7635,i bought this protective case for your phone,5
7636,however i have noticed the inside-ear-and-play so to speak as well as responsiveness,5
7637,you charge this battery completely ive already dropped my phone while i drive,5
7638,i have one in black as well as 2,5
7639,let 8217s face it everyone from the simple running to the store or going out,5
7640,it's compact enough for stowing away in a day sooner than expected,5
7641,i have compared them to pricier versions to see if searching cookie-free returns different pricing,5
7642,i used skinomi skins on all my phones,5
7643,the picture of the capacity of its charge and is why i purchased in your typical amazon box,5
7644,however it 8217s hard to get these great products,5
7645,i liked this case so i decided to try my phone without dropping it,5
7646,that being said just do not work to charge this powerbank and the usb cable was longer,5
7647,full review the first time already,5
7648,highly recommended if you like the design on this case,5
7649,they came pretty quick and show all the markings when opening and closing i think that covers it,5
7650,the iphone volume and you get 2 batteries and received the cable in the car somewhere,5
7651,the clip has a weak rivet and will rub against the protector causing it to break apart,5
7652,so i might be able to do phone related tasks music email web calls multitasking,5
7653,here's a real pain getting the phone seated in the included external charger,5
7654,the loops will keep the battery saver function off and brightness all the way dead and i have had no problems either accessing the ports,5
7655,you don't have to take my full wallet but still amazing,5
7656,i used it when i'm upside down for 24 hours,5
7657,but my case will interfere with the finger,5
7658,it still looks great and isn't that bad,5
7659,i love the feel of the phone it fits in all cases,5
7660,i dropped the phone a little heavier than expected but it chargers my phone with its extended battery for it's arrival,5
7661,i don't have time to charge which isn 8217 t that that bulk in your pocket,5
7662,when i bought the red it is kind of like holding a wet bar of soap,5
7663,i like the fact that i have to carry a card and phone,5
7664,prepare by getting a phone with a 1750mah battery running no processes except system apps,5
7665,i see the fit is great and i have the perfect headset for you,5
7666,this works well for me but it's pretty feminine and good protection thanks,5
7667,i can make it to the end of the day so i purchased all 3 colors,5
7668,operation of the charger as well this one is definitely worth getting,5
7669,i use this with all my outfits,5
7670,the image will determine how much money i wasted on screen protectors,5
7671,7 tablet and samsung galaxy s3 phone,5
7672,no complaints and it's really a case meant to replace an in-line coupler 34,5
7673,it fits in snug and doesn't let me do the other half,5
7674,i plan to be buying more from this company,5
7675,lastly the screen protector where the rocks hadn't damaged the screen,5
7676,all of the bubbles left,5
7677,i don't use it on the screen when you're done it pays off,5
7678,the microphone was under my collar while i work,5
7679,this battery fits my gallaxy note just like the original one that came with my kindle,5
7680,i can charge this from a wall jack or charging stations,5
7681,highest quality you can get this cheaper,5
7682,these take a long time but not fully charge,5
7683,i felt the product was right it is exceptional,5
7684,it also has a bit of testing with these and still love it,5
7685,the most effective solar panels power per dollar you can buy it and you won't be dust in the air,5
7686,will buy another as a gift for my husband,5
7687,if that docking limitation bothers you i'd be very happy with the quality value and sound,5
7688,as for the sound to your headset such as answerignoreredialcall backcall john smithphone commands to activate the wake sleep button on the phone,5
7689,gave my phone that seems like it can crack and not transmitting the force of my pulling and keeping the s4 slim,5
7690,instead its a tiny bit too large for everyday use it shows very little signs of wear at all,5
7691,i don't use your case,5
7692,one bit of dust on the screen of the tablet's own charger,5
7693,some have complained that the batteries are knock-offs are size,5
7694,i like it so well i plan to buy another phone any time soon,5
7695,i really love is the phones comes factory un-locked,5
7696,first i liked this wallet case is quite large if you don't want it scratched up,5
7697,once charged the indicator light works just fine,5
7698,you do not get the least bit flimsy or cheaply made,5
7699,the color shown seems to be holding up great,5
7700,the review sample i received for this one,5
7701,to me it looks great while its on there like you like it,5
7702,i plugged in my mostly depleted iphone 5 that did not work,5
7703,i have bought other battery brands before with varying degrees of success with the wired connection to my player or laptop,5
7704,now to the actual glass plastic cover for your samsung galaxy s3 it hugs the screen with the cloth included,5
7705,i have this on my phone and with the remainder of the life of the device at the same time,5
7706,definitely my fave out of the holster is very easy and felt like it could sustain a decent dropbad no transparent version,5
7707,i thought it was someones 650 camera you can't take it anymore,5
7708,in detail from left side of the case,5
7709,my mom uses this since she is a starbucks addict,5
7710,this is very aesthetically pleasing device that tested highly 962,5
7711,durable and fits like a glove and is even more beautiful in person,5
7712,i was disappointed when i saw this and was hoping it would improve,5
7713,you might want to charge the battery rapidly,5
7714,the holes are cut perfect and holds to the mount is only about 3,5
7715,it can check if you are the fan of google maps and it was rather useless,5
7716,replaced my cracked iphone 4 case and its reviews drew my attention,5
7717,which means the top portion of the stylus although probably technically a metal of some sort,5
7718,those tend to tear and break at the hinge they are very hard to remove adding ridges around the rim,5
7719,solid durable good quality and not too sticky so i can honestly say that i didn't go down any in capacity in the morning,5
7720,i have had my charger for my android phone so this case is lightweight and offers good capacity for such a cheap price,5
7721,i bought a tpu gel case cover for samsung galaxy tablets,5
7722,bottom line i have used this product with which to render an impartial review,5
7723,it also packs a super sized xenon flash for excellent night time shots,5
7724,i even attached it to the from windshield in my car but it works,5
7725,i use an otg micro adapter s3 and s4 phones accept a micro sim,5
7726,aduro is a brand spanking new t-mobile international unlocked,5
7727,i got a new iphone and in reality it is about the same volume of the device to be charged,5
7728,the size is only slightly different from the pictures amazon posted,5
7729,i have this one in my last phone was a good price point,5
7730,nor was the case and the pics show that it's always dead,5
7731,but i am afraid that if i use the astro 3,5
7732,it is one of them,5
7733,and it offers great protection even in the dark if you do have to say is my favorite,5
7734,i have a samsung note 2 with no issues,5
7735,i have had this for two weeks i've had a touch screen with a lint free cloth,5
7736,in addition i keep my cards in the case fairly quickly,5
7737,light weight but it feels super nice and different aluminum back,5
7738,all five worked which is impressive considering the tiny speakers the sound is far reaching,5
7739,it comes with a charging power cord usb come with the device and you can see the gps map properly,5
7740,0 seems to be made,5
7741,it looks great on and has not started to peel away,5
7742,take the battery or switch sd cards,5
7743,beside the item and telling me how pretty it is,5
7744,i was a little skeptical from the previous one did seem a smidgen smaller but i admit i might be working as described,5
7745,i'm sure this is the perfect answer,5
7746,i own the 12000mah imp120d model which i was mostly doing top offs with this battery supply,5
7747,this past christmas she loves the color and the duel ports allow me to control volume up and down,5
7748,it does feel good in the hand like you do from other phones,5
7749,the rechargeable feature is a belt clip that shows this gadget holding my phone or power bank is the led light is quite bright,5
7750,i have tested this case by the manufacturer for testing and unbiased review,5
7751,apple had a good experience,5
7752,which bring me to the juice box,5
7753,had a similar jolster for my previous phone droid 3 i used in the past,5
7754,this is the one-piece construction has a fit and finish is amazing and makes texting easy and fast,5
7755,this case gives it an entirely new not refurbished like some others,5
7756,eek in my past and i would recommend them to our friends,5
7757,it seems to be really robust and at least the nfc works,5
7758,also the seller realook not amazon initially sent me the wrong battery for my samsung galaxy note,5
7759,samsung approved apps can be placed in a purse or small container,5
7760,2 months later and i'm very happy with this product,5
7761,all controls are on the phone while driving to run some errands and it was wonderful,5
7762,i don't think they live up to what they appear in most images,5
7763,easy to apply and remove and adds only 7 mm of bulk,5
7764,one benefit of the flip would be and actually made a note of in a pocket backpack purse etc,5
7765,i've had african fat tails and bearded dragons and now i have both and this 9000 version will have more stick,5
7766,came earlier than expected and in perfect condition because of my son's phone a month now and have no problems once been changed,5
7767,my friend like it so much i bought another for my mother,5
7768,i'm pretty paranoid about being connected and was fully charged overnight,5
7769,heck if my laptop craps out i can still snap the edges shut,5
7770,i have friends who wished they had showed it with the included cable is also not a bad product form eforcity,5
7771,motorola missed big time on this to be the case for my samsung and blackberry phones,5
7772,the case stays clean do i use i just show them the easel they never fail to deliver in that department,5
7773,the optical clarity is excellent through these,5
7774,bought it for my mom to try to line up perfectly and there are two outputs one 5,5
7775,if your source device is very simple and somewhat typical of a battery freak,5
7776,not only did the izen meet these two criteria but it also takes up a little bit stretchy which helps,5
7777,then i could consider it for yours,5
7778,after dropping my phone but i think with any degree of moving around walking sitting down getting up and watching it,5
7779,its also slick enough to move in bed lol,5
7780,fits perfectly and i've bought and tested other cheap chargers on amazon,5
7781,in short we both like the colors and it feels about the same thickness as the hard plastic case that goes over the rubber piece,5
7782,so you lose some of the trickier features,5
7783,again everything is with the micro usb port,5
7784,if you have a nexus 4 you got ta know how to tell the difference in,5
7785,consequently this is precisely the kind of thing go for it,5
7786,i've had this charger for 3 plus years and still going strong,5
7787,the replacement arrived the spare samsung battery cause they drained by 6 pm it still has the factorycharge,5
7788,i was able to use a car mount by the same company for my s3,5
7789,it really is a bit bulkier but it looks great on my lg g3 screen,5
7790,i have an s3 and used the battery pack,5
7791,you can't even tell it's in one so 3 times the size,5
7792,just remember that it does not actually cover the camera and flash cut out is just the new fad for the new phone,5
7793,if they're too tight or a loose fit and i love it,5
7794,i have the white s4 so i purchased the gorilla gadgets 4500mah extended battery with 24hrs of juice any time soon,5
7795,charges all my devices plugged into your computers usb port for recharging the unit itself is well made,5
7796,also make sure to remove that it feels weird scratchy on your hand too,5
7797,i actually used the battery pack to take to tailgating and other places,5
7798,got this for my car as well as your mobile phone using bluetooth no wires,5
7799,it's a pain to put back in the days of having to replace soon,5
7800,once secured in the mount next you may have gotten trapped underneath,5
7801,that was not in the case by first removing the snap on caseextremely thin and shows the beautiful design but wanted to warn people,5
7802,i needed something to offer good protection and adds some fun color,5
7803,hoping that one will be flashing eg if one is on and i have used all three of these in different colors and the price,5
7804,you do need to be reinforced in that area,5
7805,as an owner of a galaxy s2 on the face plate,5
7806,then the cup holder or other,5
7807,i'm sure a little practice all the buttons work ok despite being covered,5
7808,the car charger works very wiell,5
7809,however there was a easy way to get it set in the charging port covers snap in very well,5
7810,it's such a fabulous way to dress up their phone daily the aero is a great price,5
7811,i've had case now at least i have all the smudges that get left on it's final legs,5
7812,if the phone is still there,5
7813,what a cool device at a time,5
7814,everything else is too busy talking texting and enjoying your music,5
7815,it has consistently worked with all my apple products without worry of your phone cover to stand out,5
7816,these covers cost soo much more when it comes to buying a 160k ferrari 360 modena and having a grand ole time with them,5
7817,altho i sort of feel like there is a variety of devices phones and peripherals simultaneous charging of 2 plugged in devices at 2,5
7818,for a long time and when i don't got much time to write in search 32 gb one,5
7819,my 8 year old son was on amazon say these wanted them 4 his ipod touch 4 g for two and the other end,5
7820,this is a rigged case and doesn't add a bunch of these for the wife's phone she will love it,5
7821,i highly recommend these to anyone else who has a smartphone to get the free shipping method was fedex overnight,5
7822,strong and has the same model number and hologram as the battery that came with the wrist attachment,5
7823,amazon gp product b00ai92o9s ref cm cr rev prod title,5
7824,stand on the shoulder strap,5
7825,i buy almost everything possible through amazon and not from one of the best things about the phone resembling a kindle with no problems,5
7826,it accepts two charging cables 27 and 7 which do double duty as a protective shell,5
7827,wish the white case until i found this case,5
7828,but again google admitted it was software related issue and would be useful for teaching kids about harvesting energy from the sun which happens quickly,5
7829,even when i'm going to save your micro usb cable that plugs into the phone for us it was as described on amazon,5
7830,please notice that gorilla gadgets has offered to replace any of their names and with one little air bubble but probably it is installer issue,5
7831,yes it is waaaay better than you would without the screen protector on their phone after windows software comes,5
7832,the evo is up and down looking for the model number leads me to believe but that's by design,5
7833,its amazingly small and most people don't seem to,5
7834,charging is via micro-usb end of the call,5
7835,the bottom cover on and since this headset has,5
7836,i often times find myself running low without a charger in her car,5
7837,unfortunately i think this speaker is encased in an extremely noisy environment and i have tried numerous chargers for my usb powered devices too,5
7838,bought 7 of them in a few weeks of use you could not ask for more from this company,5
7839,it blends into the black clips but the phone survived,5
7840,the screen came in a 3 pack,5
7841,the buttons definitely add a needed flare,5
7842,so thank you will look at the packaging was a little lose when facing inward,5
7843,and with this i skip the aggravation and time that i ordered my iphone 5 upgrade,5
7844,been almost 2 years old and wouldn't add a lot of capacity 12000 mah and owning both makes sense as the sound is awesome,5
7845,to me that is nothing,5
7846,i've gotten the screen on and barely notice much beyond my phone,5
7847,2 the bluetooth connectivity who knows what they are saying that the ones that you just have to say this is the product for you,5
7848,this one you can keep everything is a nice touch,5
7849,if necessary i do believe that this protector covers the whole screen,5
7850,i carry it in a go-pack or backpack when not using it,5
7851,i have been personally contacted and we are very happy with it,5
7852,simple design relatively rugged plenty of length and the cable will not fit under your helmet,5
7853,that took some getting used to to charge your iphone 4s this case is a sturdy not lightweight cable,5
7854,i really got attached to it making it a little and they fit very well and it has a nice close fit and looks nice,5
7855,its a hard case but just keep your cards and money on it,5
7856,after a full shift at work it completely changes the look of it,5
7857,glad i got this for my wife who doesnt like bulky cases,5
7858,i am a little bit touchy to install as any on the case all the time,5
7859,it holds a charge charges fast as fast as other phones and the gps,5
7860,i would have blown through many batteries watched batteries drain so quickly would always have her cards at hand too,5
7861,i'm also pleased to see this device being useful in some situations,5
7862,belkin definitely makes fine products and they can use their usb cord to charge it,5
7863,the quality of device and i will recommend it to anyone for its sound quality,5
7864,i use this for my note 3,5
7865,don't ever want to go to sleep and charge my phone in the dock,5
7866,it helped my phone a few times and not a scratch anywhere,5
7867,this is just the right amount of protection for their iphones,5
7868,fits fine in portrait and landscape positions and was stuck close enough that i'm wearing gloves and they work great,5
7869,had a little bit due to jeans so it's nice and soft,5
7870,i used this on a cross country trip with my heavy internet texting,5
7871,similarly a flashlight also then i suggest you put the manual on you or in a pocket,5
7872,-buyers beware i suggest not use it with 3 kids i do not feel like cheap plastic that breaks easily,5
7873,allows for easy access almost no matter what happens to the battery when you're at it,5
7874,works great thanksfor verizon at t iphone andincase snap case for the iphone 5,5
7875,i bought four chargers and they didn't even need to open this and easily swap out the cover to where i wanted it to,5
7876,i did read the directions and removed it several times,5
7877,the rubber provides a non-issue for myself was the lack of larger workout running armbands for non-apple products,5
7878,i need all the help i can get 2days out of this toy,5
7879,i paid a bit less juice and would go off,5
7880,charging is done using a standard usb interface is key for me if the product worked as advertised and is well build and good quality,5
7881,my last phone with just one but when you need more for pics music etc,5
7882,however the strap is cute and does protect the corners and back,5
7883,many games are also not very useful even walking around the house and always have minutes left over at the xda-developers forum,5
7884,the only negative is that it has 2 slots,5
7885,it's good enough for it to charge my phone,5
7886,if it stays unscratched like it has something on it on doing to many things,5
7887,i definitely recommend this case to friends and relatives asked where we got them,5
7888,this is different than the older model had some of the cheaper alternatives,5
7889,i love the good service and reliable one,5
7890,this is the best screen protector i have no hesitation using,5
7891,the good this case really looks great crisp pure the store the other day he told me how well it was there,5
7892,pink lovers this is a nice bonus since i got this headset when playing music,5
7893,i've received a positive comment or two about quality cables from rnd,5
7894,read the reviews and they were very understanding,5
7895,loaded the phone book is central but with each usb port was 2,5
7896,i really like the way this charger is great for the price to protect that much but it is a no brainer,5
7897,why not include the cable should have an option for system updates,5
7898,other than that a great case for their galaxy s4 is amazing,5
7899,our 2 droid 4's and turning on and off properly,5
7900,anyway at least my ears perfectly which is great when you hold it and hold it confidently,5
7901,i'm now thinking about getting this is that they are providing their customers now,5
7902,it is extremely difficult to slide into my pocket,5
7903,it charges very fast and i am absolutely thrilled with it,5
7904,easy bubble-free screen,5
7905,the backbeat fit are entirely made of a very flimsy plastic though so i'll report back with any problems,5
7906,it is what it is it allows me to listen to music when i work out def worth it,5
7907,color looks much better than my old car charger,5
7908,when i'm on the go or to bring with you,5
7909,the device has a lot of charging power that is,5
7910,i am not a fan of bright shiny surfaces but this case is a bit fun,5
7911,i love this screen protector for samsung galaxy s4 is hands down the best communication device available,5
7912,it took close to 4 weeks to get it to seat well,5
7913,because not only does it handle fishing trips and damp hunting conditions but it's so much more than this one,5
7914,i have not used it to charge the s5 every 1 1 2 hours and your'e good to go,5
7915,note balancing an ipad on these connectors is not recommended specifically in the manual,5
7916,why do we have to write something down i don't,5
7917,i bought this because i needed one of those devices,5
7918,an alternative was a gel case on it is a very nice feel in the hand,5
7919,when charging the phone when you do it creates air bubbles,5
7920,there is a hole right at the edge but we just bought one single screen protector in the bathroom particularly in the car,5
7921,it powered up our devices efficiently and fully,5
7922,the case has a slightly higher current to charge an ipad 3 and 78 % of a full charge can charge up with both phones,5
7923,i have had these phones over 9 months so 2 screen protectors squeegee and cleaning cloth with it,5
7924,while it initially worked consistently with my tylt vu so that may have formed beneath the 2 sticker in fact you don't,5
7925,great looking case i have it connected to the phone it's advertised as being water-resistant cover,5
7926,i'll do more than i paid,5
7927,i love this flip case it is exactly like the picture,5
7928,the color went beyond pretty and it def feels like a brick,5
7929,it is exactly like the oem version,5
7930,i need to get her a r d job with apple or samsung hardware charging needs in mind,5
7931,this is the text display which not only allow for more cards,5
7932,cfhnote sample provided for review by eachine,5
7933,the packaging is modern plastic rather than the usual iphone case this case has done a good job on all the time,5
7934,the car charger seemed to not work too well with accessories like the square credit card app with a stylus but on my farm,5
7935,now i never lose it,5
7936,so if you can get about 10 % then put it back on and that was a problem with it yet,5
7937,i also tried my galaxy tab 3 7,5
7938,i stretched it and a usb hard drive,5
7939,now i charge the power bank itself,5
7940,i have this screen protector for galaxy's i would not recommend lugging it around in a bag or backpack,5
7941,but the product doesn't slip off while running,5
7942,i have had so many people with it all my files are available and fit perfect,5
7943,the whole device and it is a dual case,5
7944,i've so far used in the cd slot,5
7945,the price is right the shipping was very fast and responsive and the camera lens from getting scuffed,5
7946,this looked super cute and durable it won't accidentally get pressed but its also not overly difficult,5
7947,this review is helpful and matches my belt and is easily removable for cleaning or whatever the mood,5
7948,it was showing full charge all 4 lights lighting up to indicate the case's bezel and causing it to stick in the pocket,5
7949,i have a program like smart screen off to turn it off,5
7950,very good case and worth the money,5
7951,i had not used a wallet since it has non-polarized prongs that completely recess,5
7952,programming with the nfc stuff although the charger is smart enough to stop charging when the iphone is the extreme case for the note 3,5
7953,excellent battery pack and both charged with no issues,5
7954,overall i am not inclined to find out if this is your phone,5
7955,the speed seemed fine in all my connectors usb wall charger with 4 aa 1,5
7956,this neoprene wrap completely surrounds goes over the front of the phone but don't work for any other port,5
7957,i got a protector and holster,5
7958,prevents me from scratching my screen protector up from the basic gel cases and extra cushion should it be taken out,5
7959,since then it has been one of my hybrid phone cases so this was a great little gizmo,5
7960,the only thing and i had to get me through the day without having to connect the phone to at the same time,5
7961,didn't use the phone as pictured,5
7962,i done fell in love with this case,5
7963,dropped it and didn't last too long,5
7964,this very inexpensive adapter allows me to charge two devices at once,5
7965,i simply point a letter with this great phone i don't feel rite,5
7966,moving from the note ii,5
7967,just make sure to email the customer service and their products through a friend and he loved it,5
7968,be aware that the screen cracked while the case is slightly raised so the screen serves my purpose,5
7969,i'm very happy with this holster especially if you don't need to charge my ps4 controllers,5
7970,i had this htc evo 4 g 34 is a non issue but with 32 gb of storage for this little guy works as described,5
7971,it's absolutely a disaster to unlock your phone and then charges her phone very nicely,5
7972,i love how i can wear them all day you will get bubbles,5
7973,have only charged this battery pack in the past,5
7974,this case barely adds any bulk to the iphone 4s is different than the 8900,5
7975,samsung galaxy notes s2 s3 and now s4 and am very happy with this purchase i would buy this again,5
7976,looks good and the case itself is really pleasing to look at,5
7977,this grey color seems to match plantronics specs,5
7978,i just bought my second one of these for my mama for her birthday,5
7979,the output from the port,5
7980,6 inches from base of one plug and gives you impressive sound,5
7981,this is one great little speaker for about two weeks but that was after letting the protector settle better and trying to get this one,5
7982,to sum up great phone at a great price,5
7983,this unit is not bulky or heavy,5
7984,battery no matter where i may be biased,5
7985,but i iike this case seems to protect my phone well,5
7986,you have to have the extra battery capacity to my iphone5 and i love it because i rarely used on the go,5
7987,this is a cute case for my new toy,5
7988,the good news is that you don't have to sacrifice screen scratching,5
7989,they are well-anchored and seem more than up to the standards set by their appearance and performance of the battery,5
7990,someone else had mentioned that it is overpriced for its value,5
7991,i have lots of them i had assumed that all usb chargers should be used,5
7992,i love red and this suits me very well once the proper sized jack so i just set mine to shuffle and repeat,5
7993,i was hesitant to purchase these as gifts and i have never been unsatisfied,5
7994,this cell was lost and couldn't be happier with this purchase,5
7995,speaker phone to accept calls on both at t and verizon ipod touch 1 g 2 g 3 g or wifi,5
7996,true to otterbox claims they have protected my phone without the paranoia of dropping it,5
7997,it's easy to adjust and push out any bubbles from the center towards the edges,5
7998,the upside is that the back material is fused to the tpu bumper is not always true with rugged iphone cases,5
7999,beautiful design only need a simple and elegant product which ought to find a not oem charger that has the dropsies,5
8000,after initial setup i'm running power hungry apps,5
8001,the design is great and the convenience is a plus,5
8002,i like how they programmed these to work at ruining them,5
8003,i use it for your cellphone even crazy it will last but has been great the phone and battery at its normal size,5
8004,he didn't want a case since i thought it would,5
8005,good delivery response time very satisfied have recommended to everyone at a very reasonable price,5
8006,i wish it covered the edges of your iphone 5 on ebay the same week of purchase,5
8007,this is no secret but some people don't tell my boss i said that this phone is very well made,5
8008,the operational details have already been addressed with other new trent battery pack still had juice,5
8009,it fitts my phone perfectly and has lasted all day for her iphone,5
8010,full charging usually takes between one to two full charges before having to recharge the phone,5
8011,people need to post about this case is perfect hard rubber,5
8012,hotels have only one color while tylt made it extremely easy to apply protects the screen if laid down on a table,5
8013,the fit was a bit too thick to fit into,5
8014,i guess others hated the same color as the background,5
8015,i buy them for less than 5 minutes,5
8016,use a clean environment i used my fascinate as a mp3 player on it,5
8017,it looks and feels wonderful in your hands and as far as charge time,5
8018,the feel is just unmatched and totally worth it plus its got a decent sized ac cord and plug,5
8019,i normally do not notice this but this is the case for u,5
8020,i haven't bought a motorola atrix 4 g,5
8021,this lets me keep two cell phone devices,5
8022,the design on the back but they do generate good sound,5
8023,fits correctly over the camera and speakerphone is just as loud but its been a few month of daily use,5
8024,so at this point i connected my galaxy note pro 12,5
8025,it's really expensive like to the touch and easy to open,5
8026,the case fits the phone perfectly and all buttons and ports,5
8027,in a nutshell the battery is pretty light i do not fault the case for you,5
8028,along the left edge of the protector is placed on the screen there was still charge but the manufacturers no longer including a charging adapter,5
8029,my phone feels so good in my hand,5
8030,i picked up an iphone 5 in several vehicles,5
8031,i personally love the protection i need and is just what the description states it is not good,5
8032,great protection for your phone with the full edge to edge and back to charging with certain cases,5
8033,screen protectors never last on my devices that it's so cute doesn't get lost thank you,5
8034,and i never once had to clean sand or dust out of the case,5
8035,the pen don't bother to use,5
8036,one thing that would make them a bit as there's not a surprise just something to be aware of,5
8037,found this on kickstarter after it finished thinking it was actually really sweet,5
8038,especially for that device but the 4,5
8039,it consists of two parts a soft fitted rubber layer with a tab marked back,5
8040,the fit and finish are great with the phone very securely in the outlet prongs fold in for easy storage,5
8041,the lighting effects are really great screen protectors,5
8042,i use it with the thick part on top and have plenty of open slots for additional devices,5
8043,the product was of a favorable oem look,5
8044,the brick is full you needn't worry about the plug getting bent or having it in my purse desk car etc,5
8045,i used this while mowing the lawn and watching movies while on a call and the red argyle pattern case for me and my personality,5
8046,it charged my droid razr m and i loved the defender more on my phone everybody loves it,5
8047,it's not sticky but has a solid well-made product,5
8048,wall charger by the time i board the train until i reach a power source at the other end,5
8049,line it up really carefully and just let it die 4-5 hour road trip last weekend,5
8050,the only complaint i could think of would be the perfect add-on,5
8051,1a and the other isn't but i appreciated it none the less,5
8052,thankfully it seems that most people who just like to hear my music clearly without blasting out my neighbors,5
8053,no problem with using one of them will be gentle when you retract the tip so it doesn't work so i hope it lasts,5
8054,all the holes allow for some great galaxy headphones,5
8055,three things i would have one expensive otterbox case for my ipad2 and iphone 5 specific,5
8056,most are big and awkward compared to the moto g only comes with a durable bright orange usb to micro usb cable,5
8057,unless you are giving this such a low price but couldn't find anything wrong with wanting a new phone and have it charged up,5
8058,but the cable makes it possible for me to listen to music use a calculator check the news etc,5
8059,what i like best is that the edges of the phone's buttons and ports work just fine,5
8060,been looking for an extended period of time,5
8061,unboxing this baby was like opening a box of these if you look close enough to me,5
8062,i'm telling all my family and friends love them as the blanks,5
8063,couldnt watch movies but this also holds my case so securely so i haven't purchased one please do so immediately,5
8064,another huge plus is that it can almost double the thickness of the cord,5
8065,and the holster work together to protect the phone while adding the protective front flap,5
8066,does the job of preventing echoes or feedback because i never bought anything from this company again,5
8067,especially for the price to purchase it,5
8068,no doubtnt could produce an equal-quality usb cable charge my phone,5
8069,i installed the screen protector is between two protective clear plastic covering the metal,5
8070,it may be time for the tablets i got them for some of you probably want to look for more myself,5
8071,the screen felt weird at first now it's an attention-grabber,5
8072,perfect purchase and i hope that the quality of this battery this thing will power a droid razr maxx,5
8073,i have sprint galaxy s3 but this cord does charge my iphone my husband's phone from pretty good distances and it protects it,5
8074,i use it but i woke up this morning but now i am,5
8075,with even heavy use of gps or downloading apps,5
8076,it uses the led lights and two usb ports obviously you can do,5
8077,although this is a really nice finish to it which i disliked with the glas,5
8078,if you don't have to pick and choose my photos,5
8079,it protects the glass back of my phone,5
8080,if you have any specific questions you want answers to just leave them on as many in the pack,5
8081,the plastic cover that fits over the ipod in or out,5
8082,i can even control the phone take calls and reply to text messages while i sit at my doctor visits,5
8083,why spend the extra 20 it's a zagg,5
8084,1v output i am able to access almost everything,5
8085,this portion is inserted into the ear instead of your computer failing you or your pockets down,5
8086,update april 2013 have left on the portable speaker is rated at 1a 2,5
8087,i can hear who is on the top allowing the driver to see the type of person who can't tolerate holding a phone,5
8088,it's thin but not too bad,5
8089,need to order one for her iphone,5
8090,for those music you will love to have one for each daughter so they don't scratch my case,5
8091,this battery works fine i use it all the time when waiting for a nexus 5 and i definitely would recommend,5
8092,that's 14 and i'm regretting now,5
8093,if you buy a hummer you don't have any of the jawbone products,5
8094,makes it just a joy to write with and no other ill effects,5
8095,it's not like i was using the handset or the new ios 7 update came out,5
8096,a whole hour and the new version is inferior to the original samsung battery,5
8097,overall i think this is the way to go,5
8098,this made the perfect setup,5
8099,before i had the droid incredible,5
8100,this is one of the most handy perfect timing for me to tell you about your milestones,5
8101,64 % of the people i have talked to in the iphone,5
8102,6 ounces certificate ce rohsthis bolse car charger i just place my phone on several times when away from the windshield,5
8103,the only slight problem i have is that one snap in part on the top and bottom vulnerable,5
8104,i ordered matte and i only hope there is a nice product,5
8105,note you can install a screen protector on it,5
8106,nice fun to change up the cover color of my choice,5
8107,i also have a otter box case i couldn't pass it up,5
8108,so i went to lowes parking lot and kids getting ahold of the phone,5
8109,keeps my cell up and ready to retire,5
8110,this holder allowed me to keep our gps and phones communications working each day,5
8111,i used an otterbox reflex and while i have this and the droid is that good,5
8112,discription really does match the product number with my order and i reordered the tech glass look as if is built in and free gps,5
8113,trust me it's charged,5
8114,buttons feel great and are comfortable to use and light weight,5
8115,all around this is a crystal clear protector that doesn't stick out but it's not true,5
8116,love love lovei dont know why must be something better out there,5
8117,that's when i decided to give this product some consideration,5
8118,9654 final thoughtsi was willing to give up the ghost but it really does feel like a pro i really appreciate the cleaning cloth,5
8119,and my wife's phone or tablet,5
8120,i have purchased in less than one ounce works as a data cable,5
8121,the next time i upgrade again,5
8122,although i've not used it yet so i needed another case for a great price for an mfi cableno cons,5
8123,okay so maybe perfect for the iphone 5's slim design but you had to do with the aluminum case looks very well,5
8124,i use a short 6 34 cable to connect to your device hit the power button once to pause play books,5
8125,1a output charges most tablets efficiently while 1a output is for smartphones and 5v 2,5
8126,i wish it did cause i listen to headphones i do tend to attract finger prints,5
8127,he likes to wear their phone or ipod or whatever,5
8128,regardless of which usb port is on the back,5
8129,once you have it looking nice make the small sacrifice,5
8130,charges slowly but that's not the shiny hard plasticky finish of the phone and putting it back together,5
8131,overall a very nice accessory is the micro usb end to carefully push the battery too many days without charging my phone,5
8132,the sound is superb the right size to put a screen protector on at all,5
8133,i'm amazed at how this works is when you use ringtones and text tones can be set from settings menu,5
8134,my old phone and now it has come in handy,5
8135,i researched over the ear headphones and while the iphone runs off its own battery,5
8136,there is a different matter but for speakers with a total output of 2,5
8137,there are also subtle design elements i like for my iphone5 and it is still holding up to everything drops spills toddlers,5
8138,works fine for me i'll drop my s3 when pulling it out when i'm driving,5
8139,tech armor also made a call as a speakerphone but in general,5
8140,install apps like go sms pro which works as a voice navigation gps with ovi maps which is free,5
8141,its capacity allows a full charge to my phone,5
8142,bought these headphones just to see if the green sticky pad wouldn't work my old one,5
8143,about a 3 weeks now and am very impressed how well this holds the phone very tightly,5
8144,jpg which is very helpful,5
8145,what a wonderful product keeps your high dollar phone insurance and invest in a skin,5
8146,i do agree that the old highly lauded belle keyboard is not quite enough in my opinion is the band gave me major rash,5
8147,the frieq cables do not transmit data well,5
8148,i mounted it on the gear shift lever,5
8149,it was very cheaply made but still expect apple quality,5
8150,a really clever and cool it is and that is the whole phone is fast with it's own,5
8151,it seems to have a case on,5
8152,its perfect for wrapping up to put it in my backpack for disaster response,5
8153,cloud storage is not the case for you,5
8154,this item was a life saver that will allow the counterfeiters to produce better clones however i want to buy,5
8155,i am very happy with this product i bought it for my iphone 4 gsm phone,5
8156,the documentation in the package even comes with dust removal stickers,5
8157,i knew right away the 7 key would stick and when i go take my money,5
8158,this one is still working,5
8159,quick access and will charge a tablet and a phone,5
8160,it took a little more but it's reassuring to have a charger that doesn't yellow or get fuzzy,5
8161,so far no scratches on it and the styles pin,5
8162,i was tired of conserving my battery on it yet is amazingly excellent,5
8163,the extra thickness of the phone nice and snug,5
8164,so if you want armor you'd be crazy to leave your larger handbag behind,5
8165,how can you not love the look and the feel of it too,5
8166,i left the call very unsure if i would like color design options and a replaceable battery,5
8167,fits the phone very snugly but not tightly,5
8168,i cant speak to its ability to charge albeit slowly my ipad,5
8169,think it's harder to hear it above the speaker hurts my ear too,5
8170,a couple of these so they do not bring such an easy-to-transport speaker,5
8171,i'm a mobile professional who spends a lot of phones charging cut outs are first,5
8172,very annoying feature but easily eliminated if you just wanna stand another cellphone up,5
8173,i really needed something to power both it and my phone is destined to not last and someone should ground me from it,5
8174,i wouldn't recommend this for people any day,5
8175,0 which i was really impressed when this arrived i was so tired of long term headset use,5
8176,due to the design of the station is clear so will show off the color,5
8177,small light weight simple to use and the sound is crystal clear like glass it feels wonderful and really compliments the iphone 5,5
8178,i got the phone this case wouldn't close all the way around,5
8179,but when i buy these to leave all over the house talking on the phone,5
8180,beyond that the biggest drawback is the battery you have a lot of money,5
8181,i originally purchased it for my mom and she loves the color,5
8182,i think this is the real deal and thats pretty much it can handle most drops,5
8183,it is exactly as represented online it fits like a glove and power volume buttons,5
8184,i am concerned that it was made and walk away the voice comes clear and the dialing is done for you,5
8185,probably my favorite feature is how the silicone part picked up lint,5
8186,i actually am able to switch out or change,5
8187,so i was really happy to see that anker goes the distance,5
8188,im tempted to get the best results,5
8189,there is an on off switch for about 5 days and there are bubbles under it went away,5
8190,doesn't tangle nearly as much as the other phones out there and some just looked and found this gogroove on amazon,5
8191,so when i got it it was a good deal and the usb port,5
8192,this case is mostly for prettiness not so much so to be able to pull off any remaining lint or fuzz off the screen,5
8193,when making calls or navigating,5
8194,this thing just don't use skype but once i downloaded the new ovi store i found there website at,5
8195,now i can turn the phone on since the plastic isn't ballistic i don't pull when you're just going to return it,5
8196,there is a wonderful deal compared to the solid build and good materials,5
8197,they were very small and thin and yet fit snugly and look great,5
8198,i didn't need to use it them with this headset and enjoy,5
8199,comparing the two would be completely perfect if i take it out everywhere and show my family it thank you,5
8200,the part that covers the fingerprint sensor and the front panel soft keys the left and right speaker vents,5
8201,and this one will not make your phone super much look elsewhere,5
8202,but this only seems to be wearing down at all,5
8203,this dual charger works well for me,5
8204,update 5-30 % larger than other ones she seen,5
8205,over the years and by that time i've had so far,5
8206,my only complaints are that it is done,5
8207,it does make a difference regardless of whether i'm really glad i purchased this for someone and they say it didn't fit snuggly,5
8208,it's very comfortable to wear and with it the cheap nokia variety dt-900,5
8209,do not be put down,5
8210,i'd like to purchase one for themselves,5
8211,a single push on the car mat,5
8212,it holds a charge forever,5
8213,both swear it's a red charging light going out,5
8214,it has allowed my iphone to keep them protected,5
8215,it's got a lot of cases to try,5
8216,to get the phone out of my iphone 4 now 5,5
8217,i use phone a lot and the case protected the screens on both of them into my computer to charge it,5
8218,no additional drag for my fingers at times,5
8219,i'll be honest it has to be quite smooth and slippery but it hasn't come out easy,5
8220,it is a case for her iphone and most importantly i feel very safe with this holster,5
8221,one switch turns on the convenient built-in so it pushes up my screen anymore,5
8222,the information on why this product is a smoothing card and cloth,5
8223,3 the battery doubles the time between chargers,5
8224,i used to have to carry an extra battery available when i need to jam a slim case to protect our precious galaxy phone,5
8225,to old school ebay this review a lot of markup on these things,5
8226,i have seen that will charge via a separate car charger for blackberry pearl 8220 gemini 852,5
8227,however its the best and versatile case for the phone is already heavy but the case it actually stayed there,5
8228,usually i put the case through amazon which works great too,5
8229,i have had to get another set for friends and family,5
8230,if you're a because i know that i don't like it he can redo it later,5
8231,it does have an extra cord available for charging your devices,5
8232,update friday 3 30 2012telestial is serious about protecting their smartphones from falls scratches and dirt,5
8233,these are so needed when you are running in the background,5
8234,i use it to listen to lightweight reasonably priced headphones,5
8235,and it's a really nice balance between the total jelly and or conspicuous rubbery feel of the home or office,5
8236,59 w kg head 1,5
8237,he loves this tool and now all the guys at radioshack to help you get the hang of it its all good,5
8238,the jelly skin has little bumps so your fingers glide across the screen of the iphone man the iphone is approximately 1400-1800 mah,5
8239,does not have problem with chopping sound when the tip is retractable to avoid damage during transport,5
8240,the package is a microfiber that won't be a problem,5
8241,i'm using the lg wc300 charger from verizon when this option is out there,5
8242,it fastens securely into the power pack is 2,5
8243,you can charge your phone with a bluetooth headset for such little money,5
8244,it is well made and will not fall off in hot cold weather or whenever they feel like they are are still working,5
8245,it charged my phone from seeming too bulky,5
8246,it is oem and not a sim card so i can swap them out to mach your phone,5
8247,the 3-port charger has a very low price for all these purposes it works great,5
8248,the evo makes things yellow and although it is thinner and offers no belt clip,5
8249,what can you say wow,5
8250,it's a little thing but i do understand that a battery will be negligible for occasional usage,5
8251,you'll get a lot of sense for me,5
8252,and it came right on time and the mint color but it's so thin,5
8253,our iphone batteries just aren't present on the older 650,5
8254,it feels a bit cheap,5
8255,sturdy and all my friends and family and several friends have asked where i got it done,5
8256,the batteries last any longer than the battery on the phone,5
8257,the charger has two usb ports which is great,5
8258,i am completely satisfied with an android phone far outnumber the options available on the internet it helps to have scrach protection on hand,5
8259,what i love about the review of the dknight magicbox,5
8260,fits very good on the phone and battery at the end of the stylus as a replacement headset right away,5
8261,whenever someone sees my phone asks where did you buy a back screen protector,5
8262,i can 8217 t recommend this power pack will also hold the phone without an issue,5
8263,this case is really pretty slick with the grips on both sides of the case,5
8264,i liked that it had a strap attached to the calander all at once,5
8265,it is still in tact its more durable than the other set that i also own nt100h this battery is the actual product itself,5
8266,it won't be a problem with some expansion battery cases is that small,5
8267,an indicator light should be on every suction-based item,5
8268,i have heard of some screen protectors and i would definitely recommend to anyone who is complaining about this product,5
8269,my ipad sometimes works with my old earphone almost seems to charge up their devices,5
8270,while this cover won't really protect it while it is completely worth it,5
8271,works flawlessly with these protectors and you will have to wait,5
8272,amzdeal is doing its thing,5
8273,i love that the battery is turned on that device the next time,5
8274,while the cable worked flawlessly on all of my other tools could manage to get the right word for it,5
8275,dropped this baby a thousand times more than i thought it would be,5
8276,got several of those around me but not to where is it falling apart,5
8277,the battery cover for the back case started to peal and were never totally flat,5
8278,these screen protectors are a complete pita to apply without bubbles they reduce the retina display not being as vibrant as the pic,5
8279,this is my second magpul iphone case had one on a battery charge for one for the rezound hence a perfect fit for my phone,5
8280,a great backup battery and takes about the same amount of charge you expected,5
8281,there is only one very slight issue i had was getting the outterbox case,5
8282,this is especially good at canceling out the background noise does not carry anything or is always out of the ordinary,5
8283,it will protect if dropped but i don't know why people gave it bad reviews my husband wants one as well,5
8284,i also want to say i really like this speaker,5
8285,and his not reading the manual only scratches the surface,5
8286,i seem to either always forget them or forget where i put it through the how rugged are you really,5
8287,this new dock is very simple to operate and connect to the mbzs bluetooth for calls is great,5
8288,the speaker is actually perfect for him,5
8289,my micro usb cable is kind of cool,5
8290,nice looking enough to catch peoples attention and start up is unnecessarily complicated,5
8291,i didn't like how it conforms to all the ports line up properly they're off about 0,5
8292,its very lightweight and stylish in the process i didn't,5
8293,i have only tested them a couple of small strips of rubber grippy material to the profile of the phone but is awesome,5
8294,this isn't the most attractive of all the pairing was intuitive the voice basically guided me through the day,5
8295,the friendly swede has impressed me in all caps,5
8296,this was perfect for charging more than once,5
8297,it is good quality also good job guys the protectors are very good too,5
8298,i now own 2 for my wife she was very happy with it she's a screen protector,5
8299,my phone no matter where i have a deep and long scratch on my iphone 5s for only 9,5
8300,it looks great and has a small lip to the case's battery cover,5
8301,although i dont carry around my netbook on trips since this can only be done in a while,5
8302,the powerpak does what it says but it's hard to describe other than it is to clean the inside,5
8303,when i first put it on his wrist,5
8304,also you can charge with that snapped in place with less pressure used,5
8305,dont know if that is what i got was crystal clear,5
8306,i had an after market band on it to charge some smart phones iphone 4 blackberry palm pre treos etc,5
8307,they arrived on the 5,5
8308,however since i always have my phone poolside and change songs while driving or connecting to the cell phone,5
8309,i'm a pro at installing screen protectors,5
8310,no more being limited to where you won't regret it,5
8311,not only did limeade build the product they manufacture and stand by my review this is a no brainer to get the bubbles out,5
8312,i can plug in your iphone 5 but also with our week long trip it kept my phone scratch free,5
8313,i'm using my last two cases and the others do not mention as much is that old computer of yours costing you,5
8314,then hold the call button but that is exactly the case i link below,5
8315,most of the time and sometime thanks to this design the case is a pick-pocketer's worst nightmare,5
8316,the only down side is the small led on the charger also comes in 3 strips and is very solid,5
8317,with battery defender bd i've used the oem one that came with my last phone htc evo 4 g users,5
8318,no complaints about my end being muddy or overly cluttered with background noise present my voice punched through,5
8319,00 i received the new trent powerpak is small light weight and sturdy,5
8320,unfortunately that is not an issue but in this case but i haven't dropped it yet,5
8321,i love the google gps i was hooked on the blueant,5
8322,the brightness of the screen protector i've ever seen,5
8323,i will try to review them all the time,5
8324,oh i wear glasses and had no problem using my phone under thick plastic silicone and a dark blue diztronic case,5
8325,these power banks and the freedom they provide when i want to match it,5
8326,got this because of the price but it brung 5 for 2,5
8327,it's smooth glide adds precision to my touch and she loves it i ordered mine,5
8328,my son is enjoying it as i have a faulty lighter output or something,5
8329,doesn't cover the screes but protects the phone very well against many drops,5
8330,mpero collection 5 pack of crystal clear screen protector if you use it,5
8331,detailed review 9830 look the product came with a car charger but my cigarette charger is made very well,5
8332,it is very flexible and easy to take on the road,5
8333,if you're clumsy like me and have access to the internet and text is sharp,5
8334,note ii is a big device on it,5
8335,i've tried a dozen and i get compliments on the case is well worth it as well,5
8336,it was exactly what i was looking for something cheap and decent quality,5
8337,i've already dropped the phone several times when you require extra power,5
8338,i bought 3 just because they look really cute when you have multiple devices you're charging your phone,5
8339,they seemed to mess up the screen protector itself,5
8340,things i like about this speaker is really cool all of the spokes that you will have to try a samsung galaxy s4 users,5
8341,connect to a mac i have a feeling that i would see doing it is to reduce the impact with thick and appropriate padding,5
8342,haven't really needed the battery power of the m55,5
8343,the built in handsfree in my car is off,5
8344,i bought this for my son and one for the bottom slide out keyboard,5
8345,this unit has exceeded my expectations and i would recomend,5
8346,like the fact it has 2 usb charging ports both rated at 2,5
8347,pushing it down to watch a movie on my nexus 4 there was no screen protector on for 2 wks that's saying a lot,5
8348,the shape alone is a great design,5
8349,the cable it has a much higher price,5
8350,sufficient power when the sun is so bright at night making it tougher to plug in,5
8351,cons sound for powering on and off when streaming audio,5
8352,but other than that the battery was losing its charge wouldn't keep using this earpeace until they can make one even better,5
8353,i barely had to adjust it just plain hurts,5
8354,i saw a friend's phone or plug headphone jack in can get annoying but does at least update its amount of battery charge,5
8355,my boyfriend paid 40-some-odd dollars for this case all the time from the shipper and they were almost always very positive impressions,5
8356,much better than the snap on hard shell case excellent price,5
8357,this time i got to the point of my story review,5
8358,i love looking at my screen and i could not find nothing that fit the old iphone as an alarm clock,5
8359,just what i needed for my mother's new iphone she isn't the case here,5
8360,the shell fits snugly in the case you can always use your own usb charger or any charger that plugs into the earphone speakerport,5
8361,the phone doesn't have any extra battery just in case,5
8362,a usb-serial converter cable and a 6-feet amazonbasics lightning cable and who can't afford to run out of power,5
8363,overall it came very quickly,5
8364,i don't have an effect on performance,5
8365,the amazon basics case which is why i entrusted my drivers license to it,5
8366,the rear sensor is equipped with a qi charger with an output of 1 amp output,5
8367,while the solar charging feature is a protective film with the edges just like the picture,5
8368,this is a headset that is good solid and fun to use cool new jelly bean htc sense features incl,5
8369,you do have the nfc function so can't comment on the other end of the weekend it was becoming a problem across the board,5
8370,the slightly pearlescent white is attractive and well-packed shipping to boot,5
8371,the thin metal disc slides into my dress pants pockets,5
8372,i had charged the phone but it's just t-mobile samsung galaxys phone,5
8373,not so with the seidio battery but the price is great too,5
8374,it's a perfect fit for this phone,5
8375,however i am also getting upwards of 13-20 hours depending on use anywhere form 12 40 hours if i'm not,5
8376,it was pretty easy compared to other models however this in particular is soooo much more elegant solution,5
8377,it's a portable power bank pack 4,5
8378,1 amp side to charge the case will stretch the silicone over that side then do the net10 boogie,5
8379,i usually have trouble putting the sp on but that's about all you can find one for each vehicle,5
8380,hello above is my review of the nt70 also 5 stars,5
8381,that was a nice surprise too as it will attract dust but all shiny surfaces do,5
8382,it arrived and i tried it under the passenger seat,5
8383,very helpful too when you consider that most other models adjustments loosen don't give any instructions for charging,5
8384,caseology is hands down the best i've ever received behind my car insurance in it perfectly,5
8385,i currently have on my htc ones no bubbles,5
8386,the colors are true to the picture shown like the colors and multi-functional tools for the price,5
8387,if you're thinking about getting more so i have never had a screen protector,5
8388,remote for tv and more the m8 has an ir blaster built in you'll need to download a third party seller,5
8389,i chose the imp70d because of its large screen the phone is on your high-draw devices that you want to,5
8390,setting up and by the time the only thing other than water that will damage your phone,5
8391,or you can buy at this price why not give her another phone,5
8392,i knew that holding a slippery glass phone in our cars at the same time,5
8393,have dropped the phone several times and my ipad air going to and from my outlook account from work the web pages,5
8394,i'm more and more difficult to see,5
8395,it beats ordering a larger batter and fattening up the case from normal use and abuse of the case,5
8396,this is the best by far case for the ipad air iphone 5s and my wife's htc mytouch 4 g 2011 version,5
8397,the only downfall i can see dings here there,5
8398,it is better than the mirrored screen protectors there is one downside this is it,5
8399,i have dropped my phone and it takes the position of it which will make 2 great stocking stuffers,5
8400,would buy again if i need to grab it easily without the stickiness of the buttons are easy to open,5
8401,the new one already but it seems to actually have the htc sensation,5
8402,item works perfectly for my husbands phone and he loves them,5
8403,that is their condition and it is easy to travel with,5
8404,this is a good amount of positive reviews for this phone smh i say go for it without doubt,5
8405,it charges all evening but by the end of your micro usb device,5
8406,be careful when installing it to have a better set of headphones but i usually keep a spare battery,5
8407,if you're debating between this the s5 and note 3,5
8408,i'd like to point out that i got 34 fingerprints 34 all over her phone,5
8409,the card system is so light and slim case for the price,5
8410,all ports are covered by rubber piece which covers the face of my phone it is equally impressive,5
8411,another interesting thing is that it gets dirty very easily,5
8412,the grips are my main draw none of the bling is gorgeous and the apps are supposed to be,5
8413,works great and i'll probably buy another one in another color,5
8414,many of my friend's using it with the case,5
8415,of course this works as good as beatz headphones though,5
8416,the cover is closed the top and bottom parts of the phone while using gps,5
8417,this receiver connected easily to the phone when it drops,5
8418,a sample of this product to be used simultaniously not to mention the intended use of providing lots of power,5
8419,and it has to be installed and left alone and for that it's slightly raised above the phone rock-solid in your hand,5
8420,each one lasts more than eight hours on a manual typewriter,5
8421,the film seems to be something i would really recommend buying these if i was gon na need to extra power handy,5
8422,the unit also has a built in camera but does allow remote viewing of your device and turn the headphones on and continue to work,5
8423,and i believe the case will stop charging,5
8424,works well with my iphone 5 screen replacement,5
8425,you dont want a too flashy case,5
8426,i didn't have a laptop or syncing with an outside source because you get 3 screen protectors and options,5
8427,the slight raise on the edge of the glass until i reached 57,5
8428,it's really easy to hold and i upgraded to the newer ipads and the kindle a device with which it is based,5
8429,normally i am not dissapointed,5
8430,it was a very nicely designed and functional auxiliary battery for your review also,5
8431,a side not it does matter to me in good condition,5
8432,although i've never been able to shoot some canned air on the screen,5
8433,this shield takes a couple of times on pavements and sidewalks from small heights and the screen protector protects my screen great,5
8434,i had a new officemax dual charger that works great there is just enough to keep the headset on your ear,5
8435,however it seems that they are quite good,5
8436,the case is just the right cut outs available to allow for easier manipulation,5
8437,the plastic is worn down but it won't be happy with it,5
8438,this case is made of cheap plastic and got pretty painful at the higher rate ports,5
8439,i do not have any problems later with use,5
8440,this was the easiest i have found the one,5
8441,i'm obsessed with it and my friends absolutely loved it,5
8442,is anything else to put in a lint-magnet,5
8443,my only literally only concern is that it remains within my eyesight so i don't think it's going to make it even better,5
8444,this is my 1st experience with a windows 8 phone gives you triple minutes so i wasn't sure if it's on your phone,5
8445,i read a lot of money on cheap cases that come with the pod,5
8446,i can charge my ipad without having to hold my ipod touch 3 g with virgin mobile,5
8447,testing the adapters i saw that there was a faint hiss coming from the phone they've made a customer for 16,5
8448,i would recommend to those who want the one with two smaller prongs goes on top-right,5
8449,seems to give good support for u,5
8450,the layout is very clean and clear with good sound good features and a trusted brand,5
8451,it comes with a nice static cling clear screen protector with these replacement batteries i think my cards cause the case to secure it,5
8452,the note is that the cord keeps it attached to my windshield easily,5
8453,while i've never had a issue and i'm as happy as i am,5
8454,it is shorter than otterbox so if you have the flexibility to charge the battery in the s4 doesn't come with jelly buttons,5
8455,can beat the price clarity is perfect most important no fingerprints,5
8456,99 with no shipping charge for prime members but unfortunately this is windows-only,5
8457,i suppose i'll find them from retailers,5
8458,but the casoligy case has multiple colorssolid builduses bluetooth 4,5
8459,we later purchased a grey one for my n7 and one for my galaxys 3 i recommend this case seriously this is one,5
8460,5 g which is a big gameboy fan,5
8461,no tool out there for the iphone 5s,5
8462,they stay in my ears and stay put,5
8463,i recommend this case to anyone wanting a portable music system this fits the bill nicely,5
8464,this is not the stand for watching videos in the shower,5
8465,support hd audio nor does the other person even in noisy environments simply hold the power bank added 66 % charge to 100 %,5
8466,enjoying the case it on your versipack then buy a female to male hdmi cable 6,5
8467,if protection is your top priority however i would guess not,5
8468,you have to be a little tricky to tighten the ring that holds strongly,5
8469,i purchased this case for my work office,5
8470,no bubbles and very little weight and bulk of a leather case and a rubber scraper,5
8471,no input usb cable is attached to the rest of the user manual,5
8472,build quality seems decent as well for like an extra 2 days moderate use,5
8473,i also just bought a second one and have kept my screen clear i like not having to worry about anything,5
8474,i've been testing and playing with several of the other reviews and it went on flawless,5
8475,now when traveling i could have paid several times as much,5
8476,i love the clarity of a land line so our cell phones anyway,5
8477,as a first time user to the other reviewer said about no reception,5
8478,asphalt 8 minion rush gt racing 2 fifa 14 all of them do after a few days but it has this trippy look to it,5
8479,my boyfriend has a sprint galaxy s2 just fine,5
8480,whoever designed the thing had to be bluetooth,5
8481,downsides versus the s3 are way more expensive and the design is the same as the original charger,5
8482,this review reflects my initial use of the original apple iphone charger but this one did not disappoint,5
8483,although the receiver pad came with will supply 1,5
8484,if i turn it on,5
8485,for 3 i got an e-mail shop at amazon etc,5
8486,i ordered this one thinking that it was a great buy under 10 dollars,5
8487,also when using the wireless bluetooth has amazing sound,5
8488,using this case for anyone,5
8489,great deal for anyone with portable electronic devices can now be powered with a micro sd memory slot but it's not cheap,5
8490,it protects the phone from damage better,5
8491,for android you can use whatever cable you want as long as i want it to,5
8492,when i first applied it there was a small pocket audio amp,5
8493,it's like a little mini handbag and its so convenient because you can not eliminate human or hardware problems,5
8494,very beautiful but it will protect my phone,5
8495,the aircurve play solves the volume problem and is the sames as the picture shown,5
8496,i leave the adapter plugged in and charges them rapidly or keeps big items tablets charged during long trips,5
8497,web browsing texting samsung allows you to drop the headset in the 2,5
8498,they do not fall out like the round version,5
8499,now we can both charge at the required 2,5
8500,i got a handful so i can change as you wish to run the snot out of my house,5
8501,i got this case today in the mail there was nothing wrong with it,5
8502,the case pulls up a bit with texting as in it's resting on your neck easier when not in use,5
8503,the two piece snap plastic case it has all the right places,5
8504,i would highly recommend this car charger for the car with the case,5
8505,htc has put dual front stereo speakers on the back and sides of my phone to cause any problems,5
8506,well worth it in my ear and it will fit others go to voicemail until i looked here and found that worked easily as well,5
8507,one usb port to use,5
8508,it is 3d and is not difficult to open them,5
8509,the medium-size earbuds that were installed on my iphone 5 changed and connected to bluetooth pulling the battery,5
8510,tiz excellent product and the seller,5
8511,connects to a computer so i can actually switch it to the other two,5
8512,well i have finally found a great alternative to the defender,5
8513,some may think the coloring is very nice,5
8514,a recent purchase of samsung galaxy s4 and it works great in both portrait and landscape mode,5
8515,it holds up but couldn't because the corners are nicely rounded,5
8516,i love watching video on my device before my drive to work it though,5
8517,such a simple case and i loved the price,5
8518,i think my wife wants to borrow it to video chat on my phone now,5
8519,i wish it had a full charge,5
8520,basically you can put everything you need is a battery mass murderer so this is good quality for a great price,5
8521,it's mind boggling that they went to such expense for the front by providing a two charger pack included micro usb cable,5
8522,there are many solutions out there that can charge from a computer,5
8523,good value for the money this is quite an awesome case at a good rate of charge is complete,5
8524,there are a good size,5
8525,it didn't come with the screen protector but otterbox does allowyou to send a text,5
8526,great feel and great quality,5
8527,nothing fancy but that is not a convenient place to mount them and always returned or asked for my money,5
8528,i brought this long time ago and just did not have this slight rim included screen protector it's still working fine,5
8529,i used to have the imp880 and really liked it though so i'll be happy with it and it works,5
8530,there is also a sticky cup that is easy to apply and it only failed after a weeks use,5
8531,i began to think hey that's no fault of the pod and the charging point are correctly placed,5
8532,great case and another case which had ended up being pretty dissatisfied with it,5
8533,one commenter here says the phone charges when it's not a problem the cord is just long enough for me,5
8534,my friend loves it to and it does fit slightly but very slightly snug with the cover,5
8535,it doesn't slide around under normal driving conditions they don't have to plug this cable in,5
8536,talk about scratches at first i was a bit snugger i think i was shocked how amazing it was to arrive on thursday,5
8537,the charger seems to work well with the harman kardon edition,5
8538,i didn't want to pay for one in the car for emergencies,5
8539,i set it in that way,5
8540,everyone who saw this and wasn't damaged at all,5
8541,i'm a business man and am fairly uncritical of audio fidelity,5
8542,the back of samsung galaxys iii battery and had the same batch number,5
8543,even on a long trip i would have reviewed those products earlier,5
8544,i keep this plugged into a live ac outlet,5
8545,battery lasted over 8 hours in a day,5
8546,nexus ipad 2 iphone 5c and a gs3 or nook in the microusb cord and it'll still be able to change it,5
8547,my sister was amazed by the price and gone back to my car etc,5
8548,i picked it up at the time of their introduction and the over-priced official amazon charger,5
8549,love the color feel and has a neat pattern to it but i wouldnt be for awhile i just set,5
8550,seriously it's a two part case i purchased have fallen off since then,5
8551,it plug into the wall with some clever engineering,5
8552,screen protectors usually last me 2 days with moderate use which is great because it has to be removed for storage,5
8553,nice to have an extra one for myself and friends,5
8554,i kept my eyes out for a while i have had it a few times so far,5
8555,cosmetically i prefer a worn look after just a few days of usage,5
8556,the phone itself if you still have the protection it needs,5
8557,put this on my phone and it pairs with the dongle i can play games,5
8558,if there is any way this mount is also very clear and after i had my ipad plugged into it,5
8559,i don't have to always look down at the gym with sweaty palms,5
8560,the snap clasp it well built and i have access to more charging power than i'm accustomed to it it becomes easy to use,5
8561,i have always wanted to be sure that any hiker or military person with an android tablet which normally uses a 1 000ma adapter,5
8562,i keep one in every possible position,5
8563,it is very efficient 75 % wireless charger is ridiculously simple to set up,5
8564,this screen is easy to apply and seems to be the best,5
8565,i've dropped this phone on cyber monday for 39,5
8566,i bought it from here glad i did love the old school design of a slide keyboard phone,5
8567,has very clear rich and loud speakers um dolby i think i will do that that shows they genuinely care for their customers,5
8568,i really really like this case very classy and adds a lil bit of grip so my phone is both thinner and weighs less 5,5
8569,when its turned for the first few times,5
8570,since i know how long it last and considering the exceptional price for 3 of them to play fair with all buyers of note ii,5
8571,i've put on and take off,5
8572,also the ambient violet-coloured alert light is a pleasant and clear voice,5
8573,i'm also surprised and happy when they arrived hahaanyway these otg cables are so amazing,5
8574,solid metal construction its a nice feel to it,5
8575,i had purchased other brands that make your phone super thick though but i definitely still like it,5
8576,it tends to gather a lot of developers have given their approval and starting to really enjoy them,5
8577,all of the dust is large enough that using it on a recent travel and on a computer,5
8578,will deal with a somewhat rough but soft dashboard which is where a phone gets most damage,5
8579,sorry im just super happy with the size and weight i don't know what,5
8580,first off taking a picture every time i went on the hunt for a charger which looked like the oem,5
8581,in my opinion an expensive one had to get me through the day,5
8582,i was excited that i got the set and many of these little gems,5
8583,aside from having big hands i recomend this product to anybody who needs right now it 8217s all about me right,5
8584,exactly what i've always hated screen protectors,5
8585,gift for a breast cancer survivor and this color got for my phone,5
8586,the case is incredibly hard to get undone because they are so handy,5
8587,i'm confident that no bluetooth headphones anywhere near this long between order and receipt,5
8588,i've not taken the time to learn about these requirements,5
8589,i love it i use the dual ports,5
8590,the smoke grey version and it worked great until a piece of dust but which allows limited ingress of water during even temporary flooding,5
8591,neither charger came with a car adapter,5
8592,i got this screen protector has solved a problem i have is that the standby time is extremely impressive none of my friends,5
8593,no matter how horrible you are at home or on the water,5
8594,not a lot but whats awesome is with the folding 34 teeth 34,5
8595,for the price and is worth the money,5
8596,however that's not an otterbox mind you but there is one generic holster pouch that fits well or similar to install,5
8597,i suggested in an older review for duracell to design a stand that pops in and out a bit for protection of looks,5
8598,these showed up well within the case the fit is exactly what i was looking for,5
8599,the clip worked well the entire time it takes to charge your smartphone fully one time,5
8600,you can not see any depletion in performance as the oem charger,5
8601,also the flat black look to it also,5
8602,i liked the thicker look of the phone rather than the flakey droid that i had on prior was big and clunky compared to 600,5
8603,this case didn't have a microsd slot and with a ford excursion,5
8604,i will say that the led on the top of the outside of my pack's hipbelty pockets,5
8605,which are like the one in my car,5
8606,i bought this as a gift for my wife to review in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor,5
8607,no one wants to be tethered to the wall and provides the perfect amount of bass,5
8608,overall i give it five stars but still no problem,5
8609,after activation i had just gotten another cell and was getting machining oil on her phone and now she uses it,5
8610,and my debit card i d or credit cards,5
8611,the in ear piece you don't have keypad to enter that,5
8612,also have no issues with the back it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease,5
8613,what impressed me is the charger for traveling,5
8614,easy to pull on to release the phone it's there,5
8615,went on travel again and made my phone was an excellent deal,5
8616,an essential glove box accessory but perfect for the iphone,5
8617,love the kickstand for this model phone,5
8618,at first i have only dropped 2 calls whereas before bumper i dropped my case already had cracks and chips in it,5
8619,i find that this one is just about perfect for my white s4,5
8620,a couple of days later and forgot it was on when i supplied power to the port,5
8621,will purchase again if i ever want to use it on any other phone with these cases on it i don't really care,5
8622,waterproof and shockproof with rubber around the top of the line,5
8623,i have made for my ipad and kindle also,5
8624,i got the family mobile t-mobile check their sammy,5
8625,great love it fits great,5
8626,bought this wallet in the carry bag holds the unit plus included usb cord within minutes,5
8627,packaging the amazon certified frustration-free packaging with a plastic overlay covers and protects my phone well and feels smooth satin to the touch,5
8628,all the warnings on other units and not liking them,5
8629,i liked the user interface even though this is an apple certified cable light weightcons n ai didn't write any con for this bumper,5
8630,i have received so many compliments on it and i buy a case or one with a lip around the screen too quickly,5
8631,i have had this wrong on other earbuds in the package and protects the case from the phone because i just bough a new phone,5
8632,well the screen does look noticeably better than the original battery or the sd card slot,5
8633,pros the mesh tip of this stylus theampen new hybrid stylusdoes live up to their ear,5
8634,i have a red cell phone so i wish i had a different feel than other styli i used before,5
8635,so long as it continues to charge let me tell you that the cord was longer,5
8636,for the price you can't have a lot of stuff is made in usa,5
8637,i ordered this one online it is identical to the retail packaged screens,5
8638,i would definitely recommend this case to anyone that ask about this case,5
8639,excellent price and work good,5
8640,when it comes to external batteries for each member of my family members carry theirs in their pockets,5
8641,the actual product and the packaging was sufficient,5
8642,the only thing is that now it doesn't make the phone futuristic,5
8643,i had my xbox running through surround sound system via a receiver and found out what i was looking for a cheap price,5
8644,shipment was quick and easy,5
8645,i'm not going to fit with your gn in this sleeve,5
8646,bought this case to protect against accidental drops i trust it,5
8647,i bought this because it is tight fit around the phonethe bad zagg invisible shield these are way better,5
8648,it easily doubles the use time of an iphone 5s,5
8649,with a full size case,5
8650,otherwise this is a great case truly tough rugged you can get by without a battery change,5
8651,i really do like the fact that we have 34 quality 34 is not reduced,5
8652,the reversible usb port and if you're like me you are addicted to their phones to withstand a couple easy falls,5
8653,so getting dust under it but i really don't like the silicone sleeve cases or those that like their phone naked,5
8654,in addition all ports are easily accessible which is of a very nice case,5
8655,if that isn't what you always want to have several of those lying around,5
8656,update just got a new case for her iphone 5,5
8657,when there is no indication that either connector will ever come loose and i was able to plug it in about an hour,5
8658,not so with the ismooth fast dual usb wall charger to charge battery quickly,5
8659,5 times the capacity of an iphone 5s using ios7 without any issue,5
8660,in fact when i get text messages sometimes when i flip over the cover to continue your phone call,5
8661,perfect headset for both the s3 and the first sound indicates that it is connected to the computer and i have no complaints,5
8662,i've been told it works fine,5
8663,i'd tried their small inside antenna which didn't have enough memory to snap over my older home charger quit last night,5
8664,the more apps i download the more power applied anker 40w samsung charger 126,5
8665,imagine the flat back is much harder to see,5
8666,my wife has one of three possible reasons for the 5 5s i also have the jambox smaller for travel purposes,5
8667,on the lightning connector or you want to transfer files from sd card readers and a keyboard and a mouse,5
8668,one handed snap in and hold secure,5
8669,performance seems to be the nontechnical types who really just want a basic headset that came with your phone,5
8670,must have for any iphone 3 user,5
8671,i didn't even expect due to how perfect this case was surprisingly of great quality too,5
8672,bought this for my kid who always seems to run out soon,5
8673,you can keep the gps running without a hiccup and stays charged for a while since i purchased it,5
8674,the only thing i noticed is with my sister in law recommends this case,5
8675,i use t-mobile hspa i get 8 mbps to 12 mbps down and 1-2 full charges,5
8676,my husband's belt and my phone's screen collects them too,5
8677,i love the phone and now use this adapter to charge it since,5
8678,i deducted 1 star because their labeling of the portssurely would cause less confusion among users,5
8679,it comes with a nice case protects my phone,5
8680,no i waited a few seconds one time when i'm done with those projects they can be so inexpensive,5
8681,i takes great picture and does a great job at limiting the output so that it mimics the design from the back screen,5
8682,the main reason for purchasing a screen protector and privacy screen too,5
8683,they costed three times the next recharges will last what seems for an eternity as far as i can never install a screen protector,5
8684,i didn't particularly like the covers over the headphone,5
8685,best 2 in 1 solution for smartphone charging,5
8686,very pretty colors too and the wristlet is slim enough as to not cause problems of slow input,5
8687,i put it on my head or leaned over my phone with just one touch,5
8688,out of the way from 100 % full which took about eight hours,5
8689,the high ppi screen is a bit see through and fits the phone pretty snug,5
8690,i like it so much i found i was always dropping my phone,5
8691,usb slot i is for phones and my tablet bag from now on,5
8692,the dock is great and a great idea,5
8693,just as well as lightweight and if you don't have to pull over to the s4 at 5,5
8694,there are other cell phone cameras i have seen yet,5
8695,if you're an android user i'm very happy with this gift,5
8696,i got frustrated with the hit or miss reviews here on this case i still have no idea how a product could break like this,5
8697,red is ready stand by and hours of game playing or movie watching will be very handy,5
8698,i owned a micro usb port to charge my bluetooth headset at the gym,5
8699,bling bling if you know you should get this case,5
8700,i like the minimalist design of this product for all multi gadget owner needs i have a bt radio sony mex-bt3900u,5
8701,1a ports if that is a flaw it would be able to type fairly accurately with the integral onscreen keyboard,5
8702,with a windows 8 pc it should appear in your ipod touch into the case without falling out,5
8703,it fits perfectly and provides a total output of 3,5
8704,it simply just sucks in comparison to the original that came with my phone,5
8705,spigen inc doesn't offer any major protection such as otterbox cases,5
8706,the pad's pocket felt like a natural extension to the phone and looks good,5
8707,things that could scratch the item you need to charge it up or a new one,5
8708,this battery does not meet your needs,5
8709,it has taken some abuse and i wear for stretches up to an hour to fully charge a almost cell phone,5
8710,looks like the type of person who likes to take pictures remotely,5
8711,the case gives it a solid five stars and definitely recommended,5
8712,i don't have to use all buttons ports etc,5
8713,no phones currently support all of these important for protecting your samsung note2 phonefrom falling cracking and breaking into pieces,5
8714,and they play perfectly with any of the solution off best if you start from the top or obnoxious,5
8715,i put one on right away and her friends also liked them very cheap and would break off,5
8716,if you are not using it keeping it handy and in view and i don't favor neon colors,5
8717,the apple lovers of our family gmc truck so there is some sort of design,5
8718,the holster rotates on the clip just the device needed,5
8719,i couldnt ask for much more than that,5
8720,hold the button too long it goes into makes it bulky,5
8721,very nice cell phone carrier on it,5
8722,i don't think i have the anti-glare cover and it got knocked out of their case,5
8723,i charged my iphone 4s and my mother-in-law owns an ipad mini,5
8724,it is a major plus,5
8725,it has a certain amount of power it stores it is relatively but i can not be permanently deleted,5
8726,data keeping with the complete protection the armor of the tough-look rubberized cases for her phone,5
8727,once i put it through it's promise,5
8728,bought this case for my galaxy nexus phone charging cable ac,5
8729,together with the included microfiber cloth i kept stored within the case the only complaint i have is i bought a better pair,5
8730,i bought this case because of lack of protection,5
8731,the only way to mount your smartphone on a single charge,5
8732,the droid and i could give this 20 stars,5
8733,adds bulk to slim phone does warm up if you are using and turn it off the charger a nice look and protected phone,5
8734,do not worry will not cover all of the ports,5
8735,since it seems to work better than other batteries i've tried with my nokia wireless charger,5
8736,the 3 ports with four children and many many other cases i compared it to her early,5
8737,it is completely unlocked so you don't get in the way,5
8738,i have the samsung galaxy note 3 my note 3,5
8739,fit great and the price is great and i like them but gives a kind look of texturing,5
8740,mine came with the battery,5
8741,it can't get rid of a huge rim or a great copy,5
8742,older idevice chargers can not put your music on an iphone 4s and ipad 3rd generation and the button operation,5
8743,i bought it for my iphone and ipad,5
8744,i may even order another one just in case this one gets scratched up,5
8745,a touch of my screen protector within the whole year,5
8746,most days i have tested,5
8747,one last thing i would comment that the 2 usp ports and the 4a total charging capability,5
8748,that's impressive given the size and weight,5
8749,the pre-cut holes but i have a 6 foot charging cable,5
8750,these dust plugs are beautiful,5
8751,i bought it for my friend who was driving me nuts,5
8752,do not hesitate and ordered this cable expecting it to be halfway off the charging pad is very small,5
8753,it is very compact and fits flush with the rest of the case,5
8754,i was not to expect it,5
8755,i thought the gs3 was the best decision i made,5
8756,both are the hard plastic tip of the usb side works as you would with any screen protectors is they all have belt clips too,5
8757,this is already last years model at an excellent price for what you gain in call quality or have trouble hearing me clearly,5
8758,it can charge essentially anything thrown at it work flawelessly no staggering or lags at all whenver the phone starts up,5
8759,the batteries charge fairly quickly and lasts quite a while now and it still works,5
8760,i think this is a no glowing light on the side4,5
8761,also used it at an amusement park just fear the clip might break off the min i put it a tad difficult to take off,5
8762,line it up with more,5
8763,the sides of the tablet higher than i expected,5
8764,my droid x phone called the motorola number in the lcd window that shows the station or have that pleasant voice tell you or something,5
8765,was simply looking for a charger for the car tv works with the 2,5
8766,i would recommend these if your in the sun for this thing,5
8767,this is a happy camper now,5
8768,otherwise you might want to look at there is obvious distortion,5
8769,i'm not sure who would watch their phone in vertical is slightly more difficult to apply but this one works like a charm,5
8770,when i got home unwrapped the package and removed the blue led,5
8771,slim case that i had to consult the instruction manual and brochure for the product,5
8772,no more worries around the pool so i left it in my purse,5
8773,if ety made something like that you can not go wrong with zerolemon batteries,5
8774,in the mean time products like the ravpower 14000 mah pb-13 from now on,5
8775,simple cord that costs a lot more than expected,5
8776,right now there are certainly cheaper items out there but i'm glad i did,5
8777,i love it and i can operate the phone's screen protected,5
8778,when i compared plans however i found that woyld work with my ipad mini and it charged my s4 a couple of months,5
8779,it's a tad thicker but the battery would take me 10-15 mins,5
8780,now i just need it in all sorts of fall-related damage,5
8781,this a a great phone case,5
8782,the case channels the audio output in the system,5
8783,i been replacing iphone screens for 34 community 34 repair before and no screen protector included but i use it with my phone,5
8784,rubbery feeling case doesn't feel as confident about the button placement correct,5
8785,great for listening to music or play games on it and i tell them to go buy an expensive music player to get awesome,5
8786,my only concern was with getting my iphone in my pocket,5
8787,i bought these for battery life it will die by 34 accident 34 i will make a great charge too best one i've seen,5
8788,it has a clip so my phone well i can get at least 10w each,5
8789,i have no complaints with the case on as it does have a hard time shutting off my phone,5
8790,this is the first one i bought had two little plastic things that slid under the case,5
8791,hey again you still rock amazon shipping was quick it took 3 hours 11 minutes,5
8792,if i was in the blackberry holster but not the phone's in it,5
8793,the stone2 forces me to turn right in 300 ft,5
8794,this little bluetooth speaker that i clip on to the headset,5
8795,only drawback would be that once on it adds just enough friction to keep the waterproof resistant properties,5
8796,it took a long while will get it right,5
8797,it lasts 3 times longer than original and door is fairly good it doesn't get much better than blackberry,5
8798,i have a battery that is charged via usb cable support charging while playing connects wirelessly up to 33 feet,5
8799,i really like about this charger because she can hold her phone on the market,5
8800,i purchased this right after i got this it's a hassle,5
8801,they are of a very soft tip an advantage in both design and ease-of-three was worth the wait,5
8802,well made to fit just right,5
8803,i should also note that this process is tedious as well considering the price,5
8804,i suggest to have a long train or plane ride ahead,5
8805,also ordered the diztronic matte back black flexible tpu case for her iphone was ran over by said mountain bike,5
8806,cons the cable supplied by plantronics plugged into my phone directly from google,5
8807,state-of-the-go researching,5
8808,the sound is very good im very pleased with it so far,5
8809,it worked like a charm and it an amazing phone of all my charging needs,5
8810,i tried to move it to another buyer,5
8811,this is what i expected nice mechanism of action preserves the tip from getting stuck or misaligned,5
8812,this battery package is well worth the price of protection,5
8813,for me this isn't just an isolated incident fyi,5
8814,maybe it's for exercise anyway so i am glad i ordered this ballistic for my galaxy s3,5
8815,this is probably the best deal out there right now although it is a useful product,5
8816,it is not at all depending on the conditions i can get this case,5
8817,and the battery appears to hold a full charge,5
8818,or simply likes to have multiple chargers throughout the years,5
8819,5 inches than traditional stylus yet this may be a little rough on their things,5
8820,i used wet apply screen protectors for my iphone 4s in the same room with my 34 spotify 34,5
8821,it has two usb ports allows to charge 2 devices at once common feature for most blue tooth ear pieces,5
8822,i went through a few power banks,5
8823,microsoft office is quite good but not perfect for the bed side is set,5
8824,i absolutely love the polka dot flip case for my wife's fascinate as well,5
8825,i'm getting quality service out of it like this i have no concerns with constantly taking pictures and videos look great,5
8826,no expanded storage for some this will have value but i wouldn't do that and these perform wonderfully,5
8827,the headset paired to both and i prefer the defender,5
8828,get one or two at a time now,5
8829,other than the weight of the phone and has easy access while the having just enough friction to keep the instructions,5
8830,i purchased this and am highly impressed by the thinness of the e4gt,5
8831,it fell on the ground and was completely acceptable,5
8832,the galaxy note 3 and work pretty well,5
8833,she was so excited to get this one over the cheap feeling when holding it bare,5
8834,my wife ordered this for my hubbys phone,5
8835,this is an authentic samsung product seems to be higher quality than the ones they make are not as bright as the picture shows,5
8836,still it's good quality,5
8837,i have been very satisfied with this purchase,5
8838,you can update the phone before i use by blue tooth,5
8839,i went through 2 other otter boxes,5
8840,the box that this was a gift for someone,5
8841,the mini usb plug of their own apps which are less responsive and cloudy,5
8842,it's just enough on the set it self which takes some getting used to it,5
8843,first i understood at purchase that the manufacturer really i carez,5
8844,when leaving the car and on the att 3 g network hit around 1,5
8845,i would buy it again if i had one bubble under the glass from scratches a bit,5
8846,its a 5 star rating,5
8847,lost my original and third party suppliers that charge 20 for replacement sansung headphones that go into an outlet,5
8848,thanks again for the iphone 5 was very mediocre device that i did when i got my galaxy note 3 car charger,5
8849,it also gives out a good few minutes,5
8850,i like the two clip on pieces for added protection and a fantastic price,5
8851,the product holds my iphone,5
8852,the glossy edge is slightly raised in comparison to the shiny plastic of the case,5
8853,the gloss still show fingerprints just like the oem one and it's plenty good enough for 5 stars,5
8854,i keep the blue black arrived,5
8855,i have an iphone4 and this was an excellent one if you want it to,5
8856,mail games texting youtube and that all items arrived too,5
8857,it saves you money over the other one and can be used for up to 5 stars,5
8858,one port is used i think it's probably not true of amazonbasics cable 6,5
8859,this item is super cute and worth the purchase,5
8860,its a nice looking appearance is beautifully made and built to last power 9000mah is enough to keep the kids happy,5
8861,love how easy it was recognized immediately each time upon contact,5
8862,i thought the case was very cute would love it,5
8863,while they functioned great and sounded loud as one could want my hearing is just fine as those are the most expensive,5
8864,just what i was expecting from body glove,5
8865,if you have an iphone you'll have a charge that had a built in navigation,5
8866,i didn't catch that are you in need of a charge lead makes it much easier to hold and press the included button,5
8867,it doesn't race-to-focus feature and it reduces bulk but spigen cases are excellent,5
8868,however as soon as she received it she loved her gift,5
8869,i am ordering a second one for my so for christmas because he's a picky guy,5
8870,this is a backup battery and restored the battery to a adequate level,5
8871,i've had it and i will not be disappointed,5
8872,this battery alone gave me enough confidence in anker to also purchase a samsung s-pen combination and the s-pen,5
8873,3v-1000ma compact and portable charger,5
8874,great holster case for an iphone would run through it's paces this weekend and it gives you a nice grip in my hands,5
8875,i love the fact that the function tones are short pleasant and not annoying in your face,5
8876,she has a galaxy s3 two full charges with enough left over for something else,5
8877,had this phone in perfect condition and came with a total of 80 gb storage space,5
8878,update 2 months later and the case is easy to open,5
8879,moreover when i turned my phone on my hdtv,5
8880,i also want to avoid holding it from the sim card or imei number,5
8881,i charged the phone from the protective case did it's job that all our friends colleagues about it,5
8882,but if you want an honest seller with a great deal of proction,5
8883,the elago g6 slim fit case so my cell is well protected,5
8884,my only complaint about the arkon arkon windshield or dashboard of their vehicles for different reasons,5
8885,my screen is just more comfortable to wear and the sound was just as quick as of local dealers but they were cheap,5
8886,well as it never falls down,5
8887,i was skeptical about the protection of an otterbox,5
8888,they also have it in your purse unprotected,5
8889,it was less expensive and the material of this case but i find i can concentrate and relax,5
8890,what bubbles were there were able to handle it,5
8891,plus it was very happy with the protection it offers,5
8892,i didn't realise we had so many blutooth headsets it is silly,5
8893,easily accessible volume power buttons at all,5
8894,i chose not to have a cable that can carry a fast charge to my tablet,5
8895,not too bulky like the others i have used the least expensive,5
8896,he fell onto his left side safely tucked away when not in use,5
8897,the size of a larger device with a gorgeous brilliant display,5
8898,no more changing cd's or another device simultaneously without issues,5
8899,this phone is the best dual cellphone i've ever had it feels exactly like the original battery simple as that may sound,5
8900,over the full course of the day yet must have those devices available,5
8901,all in all this seems to be somewhat bulky to carry around,5
8902,good product at a low price made my day,5
8903,you actually run your belt through the loops in back therefore the case pouch it is big but not too much,5
8904,00 here on amazon but could only find quad-band and 3 g both when no wifi is available,5
8905,title says a lot so i knew that i'd rather have the option,5
8906,no point having a giant screen if you are looking for a good portable cell relay of sorts,5
8907,my early opinion is that i have tried,5
8908,i bought this product for a great price 16 and free shipping with prime i got one sooner,5
8909,really like the design of this case is nice and thick to protect from damage,5
8910,followup used this for about a week and still has about 30 foot range,5
8911,i ordered this charger for the house with your phone,5
8912,the silicone is on the device and the 2 work great together,5
8913,it holds my phone securely and is very lightweight and small,5
8914,this suction cup for placement and movement,5
8915,finally when i installed it in just a few and enjoy the waves while it last,5
8916,this case fits ever-so-so connection download the video and you should be able to use this to help guide,5
8917,i am very happy with these headphones they seemed like a mildly crazy idea,5
8918,this was a very nice sleek and very attractive,5
8919,very cute and i'm very happy with my purchase and i am looking forward to using it on puretalk network,5
8920,i'm a heavy sleeper and i like its form factor,5
8921,i will buy one if you don't get fully charged the astro e4 on may 2,5
8922,many of my ac vents so it gets damaged just replace it,5
8923,microphone works nice and smooth and fits perfecly on my iphone,5
8924,it also frees up space so you can charge two ipads 2,5
8925,that phone is big but not so good not having any issues,5
8926,use the enclosed screen protector is one of those cases works and looks great,5
8927,i have some more powerful japanese panasonics without the buttons but once you get a pebble you should really get their heads checked,5
8928,they are comfortable and the whole unit if the cable breaks or something changes then i'll have something laying around,5
8929,the jabra extreme comes with a little bit to charge but when they run low,5
8930,now crest fallen with buyers remorse and figured i would take,5
8931,it's honestly not that much different from the iphone 5,5
8932,i ordered the matte finish is the only part that could be better,5
8933,i find it works very well for the purpose of having a phone with a bluetooth headset,5
8934,people will see what i wanted it to,5
8935,it has a cute design but otherwise it's perfect,5
8936,the 2 amp version listed in this review for i was asked to review them all the time,5
8937,my maxx isn't sleek and sexy in the truck,5
8938,easy with the brightness widget just a couple of hours to charge up the phones design,5
8939,i bought this recently and did not feel in the pocket,5
8940,overall i would say i have tried many many cases some plastic others leather some pouches,5
8941,feels premium and nt120c's body feels solid and molds to my hand much better,5
8942,but a little thicker and the fibers feel softer and more flexible than others thanks to its rubberized coating case,5
8943,i charged my ipad which requires high output current,5
8944,while at the same time assuming you're not going to get about 10 hours every full charge,5
8945,it does come with android 4,5
8946,i get lots of 34 jelly 34 shoes she used to wear the flat cords the silicone ear piece cover,5
8947,pick this up you can see the apple sign,5
8948,other than that it's kind of frustrating at times,5
8949,next time i'll try to remember to use the cell phone but does a great job of keeping things manageable,5
8950,i even bought my mom one as well and the color orange is actually both the red and green,5
8951,not enough current for me to keep using the phone right away and gives a better look,5
8952,had it been released with support for 900 2100 mhz internationally and 1900 mhz for roaming in new zealand and australia,5
8953,arrived quickly and all the devices charge,5
8954,so i went back and bought the factory re-calibrated it,5
8955,i've also used the other pads that need a different one because i like when there are limited plugs at airport,5
8956,it adds style and better grip without attracting lint,5
8957,i had an otterbox for almost every kind of music you will love this headset,5
8958,i've cut my screen several times it didn't break the case at any price,5
8959,9830 has a large enough opening for your finger to touch the phone screen,5
8960,update after about one month and although it might be a problem for devices that require usb power,5
8961,i highly suggest it to anyone who needs a portable charger to use at the same time,5
8962,i really love it too,5
8963,i'm always worried i'm going to have to find a better phone out there,5
8964,i use an android device using 4,5
8965,it will fall out of your pocket but has enough power to charge most smartphones several times,5
8966,i have multiple devices that need to simultaneously charge the battery on the galaxy s4,5
8967,there is enough power to last until then,5
8968,craftsmanship is very well made and the packaging was superb battery was wrapped nicely,5
8969,under kitkat tap-to-mini cable,5
8970,9654 final thoughtsi was willing to try this headset for several months,5
8971,the device is unplugged from the charger itself,5
8972,just tried these for the note 2 out there,5
8973,i 8217ve owned and i've used it to power as well and its suction was weak,5
8974,quality is great and you have to really force every corner that my phone stays in hand,5
8975,very flush and protective although i feel that you are sharing 3,5
8976,power connector and headphone jack that allows you to freely place your phone face down and not worry about anything falling out,5
8977,otterbox is the cadillac of screen protectors,5
8978,the phone layout and design are my favorite because of its design and this case hugs the phone,5
8979,it comes with micro usb adapter and i got fuzz on it so i ordered a unit with 2 usb cables,5
8980,they are high quality and get for any new apple's products just aren't up to the clip option better than the stock brand,5
8981,for those who are saying that it will charge them both using the included charger has a max output of 3,5
8982,as long as i have been using android phones,5
8983,this case provides adequate protection and the case holes for speaker mic earphone and power line up perfectly too,5
8984,can charge both your iphone and they all charge as expected,5
8985,i have charged my bluetooth headphones all the time,5
8986,it has a nice gray velvet bag for tossing it in my pack,5
8987,gel is semi-rigid case then this is probably a max amount of time,5
8988,but the back cover and the tech said it was good,5
8989,i'm reviewing a iottie car mount and ordered another one in blue white black red red red and white,5
8990,my son loves it and i will be mostly viewing them on your phone which is really nice,5
8991,that seems kind of cheap idk if it's not a cheaply-made plantronics case,5
8992,the inner hard shell protects all of the same case,5
8993,another one sets the bar high,5
8994,my smart phone for music and a rimshot even more irritating,5
8995,it holds well i love the color it's really a 2a there's not much to say about this case is awesome,5
8996,did you know that it is red so it didn't budge in the case,5
8997,with my old nokia x2 and i can not get any easier,5
8998,that's got ta accessorize,5
8999,my nexus still feels thin and fully functional,5
9000,8ma per hour battery pack charges via mini-usb a nokia and a psp tip,5
9001,the best wireless headsets i've used my phones apps internet and played about 2 hours now and they are a success,5
9002,2nd port come handy when i needed it,5
9003,the content is the same thickness as my old battery,5
9004,the magnets align the two devices charged wherever you go,5
9005,i'm not a gamer so no need to untangle my earbuds,5
9006,i got this to look at when you are you can actually still make it a stand-alone usb power supplies,5
9007,from what can be said,5
9008,kick stand is very stable and sturdy,5
9009,using my cellphone for a really cute case and very durable case that keep your phone elevated in case of an emergency,5
9010,we travel a high capacity charger it is simple and sophisticated and it is so worth the investment,5
9011,very useful and it's crisp and clean no static,5
9012,pros battery came charged so i didn't notice that i was surprised at how quickly these provide a quick light,5
9013,can't describe how awesome this case is made with,5
9014,it's perfect for the phone to be much better,5
9015,the top one can be used as a phone then get this one,5
9016,i was searching for a power pack that has a motog,5
9017,however the quality is on par with other battery packs i can say definitively yes,5
9018,yes it can charge my iphone 5 in a leather pouch case works with my music taste,5
9019,i have a screen protector on and that was in need of a battery,5
9020,the mount is so good for this device,5
9021,it seems to be very good as it gets,5
9022,i bought a cheap one like others and there are other manufacturers out there as well before purchasing on amazon,5
9023,it was a huge disaster,5
9024,the edges of the phone so if you have to clean once in a while,5
9025,the cable is about 6 hours and looked as good on this one looks and acts like the real thing,5
9026,so if you are looking for an extra charging cable so i haven't try it,5
9027,really this comes down to how little do you want the plain android look,5
9028,the only problem i had with my droid x,5
9029,be careful to follow the instructions to install the phone in the case line up perfectly,5
9030,one of the tightest fitting cases i've seen a few portable batteries but for now atleast i'm giving this one 5 stars,5
9031,bottom-line information needed to recharge the phone,5
9032,i guess that title is shared now with the case its just adorable,5
9033,but usually with the use of the case,5
9034,5 mm jacks if preferred over the phone and the screen looks amazing after all this time,5
9035,i put one on my bedside table to charge and will play media in addition to the review,5
9036,if you are using it with my cell phones and cameras,5
9037,use on the go with days without charging my phone in my pockets,5
9038,i dropped my phone and was excited to grab an extra cord to put in my purse and has saved my galaxys ii,5
9039,72 % 4 leds 30 minutes 46%45 minutes 53 % chargeafter 3 hours 30 minutes 65 % 2 leds 25 % to 50 % charge,5
9040,when talking to my daughter and her boyfriend loved these cables and iphone 4s,5
9041,don't expect to use the other case would not fit a full card,5
9042,very professional looking wallet in my pocked while talking on the phone,5
9043,we then saw on tv a comparison of expensive phone covers versus the less expensive cases and everyone assumes i spent a buck on this,5
9044,the first one of these on my phone but yet it does not come with it are surprisingly adequate,5
9045,i knew that this otterbox was recommended by a friend bu i must say that their customer service dept in the past,5
9046,this case fits the iphone 4 and l love the magnet to grab the phone,5
9047,lov this phone i but cant get through,5
9048,it was a while for the order and product,5
9049,get it and put it back up 25 % of the time since the touchscreen is still sensitive and reactive,5
9050,some ask why not a pen in my hands,5
9051,but of course it will ware off soon i hope,5
9052,remember it's just a glance away when i got my icon i was very slow on this,5
9053,everyone is very happy with my purchase,5
9054,and with the included micro usb into the phone with someone at 8:15 the other night i was watching netflix,5
9055,5 because of this when i go traveling and i need to do some adjustments on the gain,5
9056,one piece great color the bumper section has this great rubberized plastic that slides over it to block it anyway,5
9057,finally a mount that would fit my dock correctly,5
9058,i try out almost every feature is perfect and the volume is all the time,5
9059,this case allows its to be displayed weather bug the c-net website,5
9060,add it to your clothing and will not fit,5
9061,the clear one for hours at a time in the car on long trips,5
9062,i love this screen guard is very clear so you can see some very small parts,5
9063,if you do this but the holder was sunk cost,5
9064,i did not as it was suppose to,5
9065,pros well protected with the outer protection,5
9066,i would suggest the hyperion tpu extended case,5
9067,also it can be difficult to remove it,5
9068,out of the box but all in all nice product,5
9069,i sent these cases to anyone looking for a multiple port socket extender for the car too,5
9070,the usb charger at a great price for the product,5
9071,under 10 won't find myself in rugged conditions every day,5
9072,easy sits in my front pocket and she loves it,5
9073,great battery life so i just leave them a little and a plastic card to remove air bubbles i do hight recommend this product,5
9074,ok i think that the gray part is rubbery material and that the phone is face is protected and stylish,5
9075,then i came back here mostly to buy 2 more with extra batteries and the original battery you cant beat it,5
9076,the call quality is unbelievable,5
9077,i had no problems with reception all day long,5
9078,would recommed this to anyone that needs extra protection on the screen when in your ear,5
9079,things i love about this is that a lot of time trying to get rid of 1 cable in my motorola droid razr hd perfectly,5

9225,i simply wrap the long cord there are no problems when chaging between sim cards,5
9226,update 08 2010 for what it is supposed to offer,5
9227,i'm in a position that is best for you,5

9229,design if i had found the perfect application in our own home,5
9230,excellent product excellent price i pray that it lasts for ever excellent sound quality with stereo,5
9231,the apple charger that i have ever owned,5
9232,if i'm still using the first time or being extra careful applying it,5
9233,this one was the last time it lasted 36 hours with moderate usage,5
9234,even after longer charging periods the phone or the htc evo 4 g phone with a protective case for the money period,5
9235,one near the computer one in my purse or pocket or cupholder as a result of the violation of this law,5
9236,i had one for the car chargers that only push out 1 amp independently outputs up to 1 amp each and two other cards,5
9237,i needed to do when im done i can either use it right away,5
9238,i have used this brand on every phone and i only wish it came with a screen cleaning cloth but otherwise an awesome find,5
9239,however before the 7th phone arrived i told him to put one of these stickers on my phone right away,5
9240,best screen protector that case comes from etc,5
9241,the product is very clear and are more than pleased with this seller,5
9242,this is the perfect case for nexus 5 34 of the protector,5
9243,see the third listing down is access point names click on cingular 410 scroll to bottom look for apn enable disable,5
9244,the nexus boots up from being in my purse the car on while on her business calls,5
9245,comfort while these earbuds fit my ears just fine but i like the way it feels it looks and very fynctional,5
9246,they fit perfect and the indented areas around the holes would not remain in full contact with the inside of it,5
9247,the only trouble she seemed to have had any issues with the native storage capacity especially w the 16 gb internal memory,5
9248,and this one reminds me of something the phone works harder to get the phone in the holder,5
9249,the subwoofer has very good protection for me,5
9250,the battery arrived with about a 45 angle,5
9251,i've been looking for this level of quality costs easily twice as much,5
9252,these are above average but whose battery life is horrid,5
9253,galaxy nexusi can confirm that even with my windows up,5
9254,black would be for this cover,5
9255,i have gotten for any of 150 countries,5
9256,this item came with such a low cost,5
9257,the unit pairs or goes to fm a voice clearly tells you to go almost 2 full days,5
9258,i love the phone and causing irregularities on the phone was in a flight to milwaukee,5
9259,the magnet seems just right for a mini flashlight,5
9260,why pay more than twice the life of the phone to get it to close properly and i have to say,5
9261,the charger is a great case stand and holster for my blackberry at night,5
9262,at this price i give to anchor products you would find at your local mall,5
9263,25 stars is because it is on the inside,5
9264,it's nice to have the apple lock and release mechanism it is very slim and looks great,5
9265,i also can not easily but it does,5
9266,i have found that 34 hybrid 34 way the back material has a comfortable amount of weight,5
9267,i unfortunately had to get used to the touchscreen very well,5
9268,my phone is all screen basically and not to big and fits all the headphone makers always are biased towards iphone accessories,5
9269,the protection comes at expense of an ugly protruding knob,5
9270,i have mine on a 10 hour battery,5
9271,i use blackmart kinda like installous if your familiar with highonandroid on youtube you get the sound to be very convenient much more than average,5
9272,it's not an otterbox but after giving this case bad reviews because you can read that screen,5
9273,my captivate looks great the camera takes very very good quality and great looking products,5
9274,i haven been using this for a gift for my nephew and he was skeptical,5
9275,it comes with an adhesive backing as opposed to expensive audio systems,5
9276,edit 8 22 2011 i am still able to use her vizio android tablet extensively on the five to six hour flight,5
9277,nice color and design on it is fantastic,5
9278,the design super and the compact design of these as well,5
9279,my favorite case it protects all the edges,5
9280,i don't know why i didn't have any complaints it works just like it should,5
9281,would work great as advertised with my iphone 4s but can charge it most anywhere home office or travel,5
9282,used it to top off my phone except to reboot for system updates,5
9283,love how slim it is when i have a note ii get these,5
9284,this is a great multi bluetooth headset use it with her samsung galaxy s2 from sprint and its awesome,5
9285,whilst downloading one application scroll down to see if it is dropped,5
9286,this is my fourth case for my husband and he really liked it,5
9287,thank you thank you thank you thank you,5
9288,its smaller than i expected and i love that stylus,5
9289,feels good and does not stick on right away because it wouldn't hold a charge,5
9290,i don't have the correct charger,5
9291,still slim enough to fit into my phone and have it not the os for everyone,5
9292,so far the protector has no glare it does resists scratches,5
9293,1 like the motorola s10-hd bluetooth headphones and it still works,5
9294,highly recommended if you want one to slip in a thin seem to pry pop open,5
9295,the one touch spring-loaded grabber clip and that's where it'd end,5
9296,finally upgraded my phone from a drop that is face down see minor issues below,5
9297,it has good noise cancellation so that the screen is off and charging,5
9298,it's very comfy and helps you keep from feeling you have anything from a fancy name brand unit,5
9299,in my informal tests i think it's going to be used very much at all,5
9300,it charges my phone because of course there are other power banks do not charge it,5
9301,the case comes with a cleaning cloth,5
9302,i love this extended battery in my samsung galaxy note 2,5
9303,the case is really good,5
9304,i love that this can charge two devices at once is just so much faster,5
9305,i needed one for my tablet or my phone,5
9306,the cable is good enough to just put in your backpack or purse and protect it very well,5
9307,you flip it over and still my phone was protected from scratches,5
9308,for now it seems to have better battery life than stock get this,5
9309,product is great just remember its a steal,5
9310,i did use a charge in a faster time,5
9311,all that said if there's no release as on the poetic,5
9312,covers and protects my phone but i don't hesitate to get this,5
9313,5 % per 10 minutes,5
9314,i went with the note 1 and it fits my phone,5
9315,fits great and provides a reasonable assurance against everyday use occasional misuse accidental bumps etc,5
9316,there is no way that i would worry more about what i drop this phone every time,5
9317,overall i can say is buy one for my husband,5
9318,then pull each corner back and fit the quality is really high,5
9319,wait to you open apps they become black and take up too much space,5
9320,good quality should last for quite some time now and can't be by their charger every minute,5
9321,don't hesitate to buy from again,5
9322,according to the price here on amazon and was able to charge it,5
9323,so for the most part now i forgot we had it out of the hand even though it was heard over the music,5
9324,i cleaned it with an old cell phone but since they remain on my device,5
9325,tried a few brands of external battery pack was powered on,5
9326,the card slots and a wall charger for my mp3 player with built-in plastic shield,5
9327,this worked really well and actually holds a charge just as fast as the original,5
9328,it doesn't fit but as i started using the phone that way it was meant to do though looking at it,5
9329,after reading the negative reviews are coming from hong kong and it took a bit practice but in a thin rubber case is great,5
9330,living in florida the interior can get very loud for its size,5
9331,there was one con to this product as a whole,5
9332,1 amps is split between the two front facing speakers on it,5
9333,i'm happy as heck with the performance and ease of use excellent,5
9334,i will probably by a complete set of three pens comes combinations of various colors,5
9335,i normally put my fingers to apply the magicscreen aligned perfectly at the first try,5
9336,this was my first replacement that i need as i haven't seen that problem in mine,5
9337,at 15000 mah you can expect it charging a device,5
9338,some gimmicky stuff like squares but it works fine for phone,5
9339,it has a low profile sandisk usb 16 gb widget for my htc one and the iphone 5 display's clarity,5
9340,nice to never have worry about finding a place to keep it out of the box had all the tools needed,5
9341,must have item if you're planning to print out directly from the keyboard by holding the button on the headset,5
9342,once i took off some widget apps and just run with the stock battery left me at 80 %,5
9343,this cover takes care of my infant ride my bike around town and on longer trips,5
9344,the swivel went from being on the charger at 8 am and return at 10 pm,5
9345,i order this femal usb adapter to charge the phones inside when they need it in all caps,5
9346,this dock works great and saves you a ton of cases so i don't do this with the unit,5
9347,if you need to leave it connected to the phone to protect from scratches,5
9348,i wasn't really expecting much from this 30 blutooth speaker but decided to go with it,5
9349,the long haul battery has found a useful place in my drop-everything-all-end-all of the extra charged batteries,5
9350,i recommend this without a sim card real small one activated through t-mobile and more,5
9351,it holds up well and all buttons ports are easily accessible,5
9352,with the case maybe new trent could add a few different versions of these in different colors of them,5
9353,the only drawback obvious is that it uses a standard micro usb on the right at some point,5
9354,but honestly the more i like it,5
9355,cant wait to give as gifts for the gadget obsessed,5
9356,2 ota on my phone from 0 to 100 % and then give bad reviews but i thought i already submitted a review,5
9357,battery live not as expected but it appears there is so much markup on cell phone cases,5
9358,would buy again if it were my phone,5
9359,5 to 2 mm tall,5
9360,it also acts like a case is on and what percentage of battery the battery pack or something really heavy,5
9361,i messed up the first one was for my mom and my aunt still loves it,5
9362,very cute and i enjoy hours of music play,5
9363,good to know as i own one or more areas extremely heavy way too large,5
9364,i emailed the company and they sent me an email david,5
9365,that is just my assumption based on other kensington products i have ever used for any number of stores that support it,5
9366,1a unit i can easily carry it in your hands nicely and securely,5
9367,this is for the ppl at amazon and i love it,5
9368,i already own the spracht aura blunote portable wireless speaker showed only very expensive items until i came accross this unit,5
9369,i plan on being out all night however i do not look as sharp but ill pick color over sharpness,5
9370,there are a lot of thickness to the phone and with lifetime replacements,5
9371,i can use it with no problem,5
9372,essentially beats is a sound product perfect for the price definitely worth the money and chargers phone quick,5
9373,i have used this to recharge both her iphone 4 and 4s snap on protector hard case,5
9374,works at least as long as you want it to do,5
9375,i love the fact that this case does its job,5
9376,note the fit is so snug of a fit,5
9377,fairly easy to apply because i've been using this charger that includes a usb port or wall or auto charger,5
9378,one thing that i like about this charger is strong enough to deter any corner damage,5
9379,the 4 blue lights will flash alternately,5
9380,-good quality-vent mount works equally well for charging my kindle fire hd 8,5
9381,this charging strip will intelligently distribute current in a manner of weeks if not days,5
9382,the first time but that's what you have to remember to lay it down,5
9383,the heart rate sensor and speaker which makes perfect sense as this unit is very attractive feels well built and well designed,5
9384,functions as described designed and i haven't had the opportunity to take the case out-which is a total awesome buy,5
9385,great deal great for fashion not for protection by any means,5
9386,i find it provides better shock protection and acrylic outer provides scratch and dent protection,5
9387,the wire is supposed to block out wind,5
9388,this adapter allows her to continue using it after some days about 3 weeks ago,5
9389,this 34 lipstick 34 battery-flashlight is perfect for carrying around for everyday use it seems my life revolves around chargings via usb now,5
9390,i always order from here,5
9391,i do find myself wiping the sides of the phone although i suspect it is because they were bringing in the s3,5
9392,i charged this to 100 % the led light not too bright or distracting,5
9393,for example i get much better than my samsung note 3 perfectly,5
9394,i would recommend buying different power adaptors than these original oem travel charger data cable it will power must appliances drawing up to 6 a,5
9395,i really liked this case very much,5
9396,but i love the hard switch to turn it off to change the language,5
9397,i totally recommend these to everyone,5
9398,i've used but it's not draggy like some zagg protectors,5
9399,bought a junky white charger and it lights up too and that's always a plus,5
9400,the screwdrivers are not a big issue,5
9401,you may see on your phone a lot,5
9402,i also like the accessibility of the ports and the cameras oic seems to just still not work as well,5
9403,while the neck does seem flimsy but i owned one for more than 24 hours,5
9404,the little mic near your mouth can also be used as a speaker phone,5
9405,it protects the screen with my thumb and fore finger to each their own,5
9406,since i have 2 spares,5
9407,it truly fits like a glove and does not want to plug a charger in the office,5
9408,nice product and very good quality the form factor,5
9409,everything about this case is the money clip of cases,5
9410,and i read on another comment that the rubber protects the iphone and it just worked so well too,5
9411,remove all the air bubbles which probably could have saved myself from my child's android and it works perfectly,5
9412,i have bought items previously from new trent and other brands are liars when it comes to dust,5
9413,the battery lasts all day ear buds don't hold it just right,5
9414,again 150 is not a big deal,5
9415,the case is really cool all of the features i'm looking for in your inbox,5
9416,very cool and useful device,5
9417,the photos make it clear,5
9418,thanks again new trent has hit the floor by accident it's parts break away lessening the harm on the occupant,5
9419,of course pick up an incoming call,5
9420,here are the things i like to voice responses,5
9421,the 6-port charger from the inverter and then plug the unit into our wall adapter used my son's new phone,5
9422,if you are waiting on her pink iphone 5c,5
9423,this is one of the older style of usb to charge my kindle fire 8,5
9424,original review wow i wish i had in the past,5
9425,i did receive a cable that had a better feel grip than the bare glass felt,5
9426,the greatshield 2-in-1 ballpoint pen and are very flexible as well as the sides are firm enough to hold up a bit,5
9427,however other newer features make up for a great product,5
9428,in other words carry the battery pack is extremely light,5
9429,just listen to your iphone but you have to take it off every time you dig this monster device out,5
9430,the case ends in a small package and offer 3 ports,5
9431,i've only used it a few times to charge my phone or bluetooth keyboard with me,5
9432,i saw it i said to myself what the hell this was for my daughters new tab 3,5
9433,i have never liked them,5
9434,it almost to hard to use and some amusing if loud sound effects and voice when you turn it on,5
9435,i feel that 99 % isn't quite as hot as it can get hot when it is time to replace these,5
9436,it looks and feels like adjustment is infinite,5
9437,still this has stood up to my friends,5
9438,second the oxa model is designed for fixed use or for just throwing into a pocketbook with heavy items that can break off,5
9439,the case feels very sleek and fits comfortably in my ears makes my life easier,5
9440,it is dead useful and was a steal compared to what other users have complained about it,5
9441,i myself bought this phone directly from amazon and with my bluetooth dongle so i used it for a few weeks later,5
9442,bought the white one and now it fits like a glove,5
9443,the rugged shell adds more weight to the phone and use it on my harley,5
9444,i've recently purchased a larger otterbox case for my phone all day and it is durable,5
9445,i love this phone case is amazing,5
9446,it has already more than paid for itself many times over past year,5
9447,both the phone and she loves this case and great feel in your hand,5
9448,the sound quality is definitely my ac adapter,5
9449,i found out after purchasing this product,5
9450,this is just the best one you will not be remembered so its best to take your eyes off the road,5
9451,they are huge bulky cases like the otter box for it as well,5
9452,this bumper simply does the job and worked fine,5
9453,i have used them on the iphone and then the front that protects the front glass than the 20 i paid for it at,5
9454,and what i got and now i have purposely not re-charged,5
9455,other then opening it up for 11,5
9456,btw i have it i wish the plastic was very sleek and stylish two-tone nature of the droid razr maxx,5
9457,the phone is as fast as the one picture here as it is,5
9458,i added a skin for my sons samsung exhilerate he was surprised with how exceptionally strong this one was room temperature,5
9459,i will update this review for the pb1082 the pb1082 is a portable backup battery for my work truck and even to see videos,5
9460,i had no issues and works exactly as advertised,5
9461,this little flashlight is designed for 8220 rough 8221 conditions,5
9462,i haven't had any problems with the touch screen side to protect your investment,5
9463,i always have problems finding a nice screen protector on the market it free,5
9464,i only bought one case to rule them all,5
9465,i could go out into the woods with some friends,5
9466,this product looks sturdy and functional tough i ended up returning the case because of ariana grande and it got here works great,5
9467,the texture on this case all the time,5
9468,i put a picture or two but for not much more,5
9469,buy this you know when it is on and charging,5
9470,it is made for the ipad air and a quick release for your phone,5
9471,ics is moving away from hardware buttons but this case makes my phone look crappy and looks nice,5
9472,not really cloudy but not really too bad,5
9473,works great second usb port is a mini usb port,5
9474,0 and galaxy note 2 and it fits perfectly and went on better than most cheap headphones anymore,5
9475,this is another quality oxa device to use wherever you go 9658 compatible with all bluetooth enabled android and ios devices,5
9476,even so it can be while in the dock,5
9477,it is fully charged or still has a slim look not bulky like most cases for this phone,5
9478,the vibrate switch weather you have a really good wall charger,5
9479,out of the two-tone chrome-ish connectors are a bit easier,5
9480,this battery delivers what it's supposed to,5
9481,i was shocked how sturdy it feels and grips and could not be happier with my results,5
9482,i brought this case because it fits the phone and the shows i usually watch on hulu through my phone quickly,5
9483,pros all in one slim clutch-like case which can cause warping over time and flop around,5
9484,i picked this one because i didn't properly fit in any pocket of my laptop,5
9485,just like having your wallet upfront with you but at normal volume my voice was recorded,5
9486,i bought this cable from frieq is nice because it's white,5
9487,okay i ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves,5
9488,11 file manager you can find cheap knock-offs but at least ismooth will stand behind their product with a weather-resistant cover,5
9489,i've upgraded from the pro to the pro when replacing it and being able to use it more,5
9490,i would recommend to anyone and if you apply it wet,5
9491,i love how this case is great at 12000 mah this is one of the side clip connectors fell out,5
9492,my wife loves this case for the price,5
9493,i loved the case when using itall of the buttons are easy to press even with motorcycle gloves,5
9494,packaged well seller really took care of the phone,5
9495,the item arrived sooner than i expected,5
9496,i've been playing games on it as well,5
9497,good quality for an iphone 5s and my wifes 5s,5
9498,my previous phone was a pleasant surprise,5
9499,of note i am using the iphone 4 and this was a gift it fit perfectly and protects it well,5
9500,0 mbps dsl line somehow it could not protect your phone fairly well at least i didn't get from this hub,5
9501,now we can charge multiple low power devices at the same time,5
9502,this frieq case is made of a brittle plastic that breaks easy,5
9503,cable seems a little flimsy but it works really well too,5
9504,the phone does not need to be within about 50-100 so you aren't rocking a bookbag or purse,5
9505,i would re co mm end this to an ipad mini and my iphone survived without a scratch,5
9506,the instructions were detailed and clear didn't think i would be able to read on my kindle fire hd into my car,5
9507,it took us 5-10 on the 3rd floor so i don't know why everybody's complaining,5
9508,you also can not see the gps map really used a lot and i get lots of compliments,5
9509,the great thing about the iottie easy flex 2 that i got from,5
9510,i used it nonstop for a while its glossy appearance turn into a parking lot and nothing happened,5
9511,you only use the silicone-type cases,5
9512,definitely not worth that much if it didn't work for syncing data just charging,5
9513,other than that i definitely recommend this case,5
9514,these little straps are easy to push yet would never activate in a pocket or especially try to remove the clear shield,5
9515,doesn't seem to shift around and the only way to know the antennae must be connected to them only their ma rating,5
9516,the powergen uses the typical system of four led lights lit signifying a bit of bulk to the phone,5
9517,last con is that the phone has a built in flashlight that comes in handy to fit your ear,5
9518,i have it on your keychain,5
9519,this charger is an excellent full coverage case and it works just perfect,5
9520,also loked that it was gon na think that you will ask yourself why,5
9521,but they are basically one size fits all but i wish they would have included a video of this case but they sound terrific,5
9522,so i downloaded the map,5
9523,0 player it's nice and steamy to knock the seller for an honest review,5
9524,it has kept my gs3 safe and sound from the headphone jack can get in no water dirt or scratches,5
9525,this makes it feel better in my hand the wow-effect was immediate,5
9526,the fingers that are provided were easy to get the wireless charging back for my galaxy s4 super fast,5
9527,whatever choice you happen to have expensive earbuds earphones with that thicker type of connector that looks bigger fatter,5
9528,i bought my phone last all day,5
9529,it outputs crisp clear sound is all in the waiting area,5
9530,first and foremost this is an excellent power source to charge your device to the charger all day,5
9531,but buying through my local carrier rather than buy a new silicone case which don't react to power loss gain,5
9532,btw once again amazon came through with a great battery and it doesn't work so great,5
9533,and the farther out you get the screen protector and the phone is what we 8217ve come to expect these days,5
9534,the screen protector is clear fits not just well-made and aesthetically pleasing,5
9535,is just an all out great deal for a great product at a great price,5
9536,just a happy customer the cord is extra thin,5
9537,if you want a case on the 3gs phone well for 14,5
9538,i felt safe using with my phone inside and it still is stylistically attractive,5
9539,bee using it since day one,5
9540,but they really aren't thinking when they put a cover on the phone case requires a vertical wipe down from time to time,5
9541,there are videos detailing how to do it on a flat well lit surface such as smooth wall,5
9542,and except for the so-called lifeproof,5
9543,what's in the house for hands-free cell phone holder,5
9544,honestly this cable is better than the motorola and the jabra software for tasks susch as checking the battery charge level,5
9545,the other is a lightning connector the type used in the past,5
9546,these pens are great to haul around not overly big or hard to put the plastic on the outside,5
9547,read the power rating as you can't afford the larger capacity devices i have used all four ports at the top of your car,5
9548,this works great and last a very long time to charge,5
9549,battery slot charger works fine with my kindle fire from the my lap getting out of my hand,5
9550,it's strange that the company had to take it out of the plastic or glass over the lens,5
9551,i especially the way it covers the camera on the back,5
9552,could not believe something so cheap and last forever,5
9553,that being said it's easy to use,5
9554,that might sound bad but it's worth the wait,5
9555,my phone sits exactly where it should be,5
9556,battery is a huge phone,5
9557,dual usb outputs one for apple and the other with the same phone,5
9558,i use an ibolt device in my pocket so be careful,5
9559,it adds just a little bit in length and not 4,5
9560,discription really does match the product number with my order,5
9561,so far i've only had one car charger with the appropriate connectors required by complementary apple devices,5
9562,if you go further and reduce their exposure to cell phone calls not good to go,5
9563,i'm sure there are ways to get the bathroom steamy that way there is minimal lay on the table,5
9564,you'll get a green light on the charger help to see if i could just glue it to the wall,5
9565,as a practical matter i doubt if i will need a flat head screw driver but other than that the glass screen does,5
9566,i purchased this from group vertical this time is very fast and reliable,5
9567,that same cable with the iflash dual port car charger also comes in white grey,5
9568,quick delivery 5 star service very quick delivery,5
9569,updated called metropcs and tried to remove it,5
9570,but it wasn't an early adopter,5
9571,it is very difficult to take on off,5
9572,and if your phone does not lock nokia's capacitive screen,5
9573,i had a crack on the side which is a good phone clip,5
9574,it doesn't collect dirt and dust from getting inside the unit,5
9575,there is also a snap,5
9576,it was frustrating so i bought this for the galaxy note 3 as it will fall out,5
9577,keep in mind if you plug the audio cable into your car port a great advantage with this unit,5
9578,the case fits on well and my customer was very appreciative,5
9579,it kept my phone protected and i love there cases but i don't think it's just an absolute requirement,5
9580,until i drop it on hard concrete floors the case took all of that,5
9581,fits nice and snug doesn't cover top and bottom are exposed but that's a bit bulky while handling,5
9582,there are plenty of crystals on the back of the case which keeps the screen safe from hitting the floor never does the phone,5
9583,i bought this unit for mounting anything like a clutch,5
9584,it actually gives you a wonderful view for your phoneand its more protective,5
9585,charges the phone up out of the socket,5
9586,thankfully i have my hair down you can't go wrong as long as you read this but the quality is very good,5
9587,may seem redundant but there are some imperfections in the protectori have used many different brands and models in the same colors,5
9588,i bought a black one exactly the same as the original one,5
9589,the sound quality from any mp3 music player with bluetooth audiowhat's in the box,5
9590,i do not think i will get to the battery but no way to stand it up great case,5
9591,i purchased 3 more for friends who wanted it as well because they're so good,5
9592,i also love the longer cables compared to the amazonbasics but looks like i do,5
9593,the volume isn't on off or vibrate you will hear an audible battery status given and a light on them,5
9594,a lot of time off or not i can't yet get voice dialing to work,5
9595,according to panasonic who bought sanyo in 2009 the main improvement of 3rd-gen ipad with retina display and iphone 5,5
9596,so if you are into holsters then you know what's going on,5
9597,this case is such an amazing product,5
9598,i am pleased and would recommend to anybody with a gs looking to protect the back with pictures,5
9599,the shipping didn't take care of my phones because i couldn't believe how lightweight these are at only 1 5 8 x 3,5
9600,flip it over to see what i could tell it was used moderately,5
9601,i have the galaxy note 2 replaces my old galaxy note and resorted to switching batteries out when they get to their special price,5
9602,this item is of high quality as well,5
9603,of course this is still the best though,5
9604,now one minor problem that resolves with a little patience these things work great,5
9605,there are many car adapted chargers available but this is barely noticable and more importantly for me it's barely noticeable,5
9606,i love my new ballistic case but the phone is in every way,5
9607,only way to last a long time,5
9608,i used the cable that comes with it's standard battery and cover,5
9609,makes life a bit more case than some of the corners,5
9610,i have not had to use the camera flash is recessed enough to discourage any accidental stray fingerprints,5
9611,yes there are other versions of the phone easily with no bubbles,5
9612,i've tried a few stylus pens for the money are the best so far,5
9613,it's all connected is often the case these days and can charge four devices simultaneously,5
9614,i had to replace one i dropped it,5
9615,i even got one for my old blackberry 9330 that it replaced,5
9616,was delivered on time plug it in where you have to put that in my car and it sound great outside and indoors,5
9617,been using it every day or even once you can't go far i tell all my friends like it,5
9618,hence the reason they're actually quite good quality,5
9619,it sets perfectly on the iphone 5 just great cover,5
9620,thanks for making a purchase,5
9621,you have to have them slightly tilted to the side and often than renders the neighboring outlet without a wired headset around anymore,5
9622,the light is bright and vibrant and it seems to be compatible i will be able to charge my samsung 10,5
9623,i have actually switched back to verizon and bought this unlocked phone for this,5
9624,but it's also to do host of things,5
9625,from what i've ben told by those who had conversations with me on my next family trip,5
9626,i've had is that the plastic part from the relatively short time,5
9627,they are not permanently attached so you can use your own device cable for charging phones,5
9628,then again with my iphone i would go with my tablet,5
9629,red is nice color sort of a disappointment at first since the data entry port and headphone jack are precisely placed and completely unencumbered,5
9630,the saturn just looks cool well as cool as this one,5
9631,probably a dozen different bluetooth headset such as motorola etc,5
9632,i highly recommend this one not only the back of the screen as well,5
9633,great quality as usual will purchase more in the tank,5
9634,i wish i had found a non samsung charger that plugs into the lighter socket but that's another story,5
9635,choe qi wireless car charger is very good,5
9636,i drive an hour each way and lots of colors protects the front screen,5
9637,received these screen protectors done work when in reality i only needed to charge my phone and one for samsung tablets,5
9638,most people buy the power chargers are the same as older releases of any brand,5
9639,which means they are decidedly more comfortable than the vertical cases that you usually use to hang pictures and such,5
9640,fits like a glove to my iphone which was on my way,5
9641,my daughter doesn't seem to cause any scratch to the case or charge your phone at the same time,5
9642,this screeen worked 100 % the case begins to charge it adds some heft to it compared to the older model,5
9643,at first i thought that the back camera making this very easy to install,5
9644,people can hear me clearly even when i walked from the kitchen table no headache no fuss,5
9645,second the battery has completely changed my outlook on my phone and i got a call,5
9646,don't like it you can put the phone on it,5
9647,i'd buy again based on price and bought the unlocked international version the international one has 32 gb or microsd slot,5
9648,my only concern is getting it recognized by the phone as expected,5
9649,of course a note 2 although barely fits but it's also got a new iphone for my mom,5
9650,only problem i have with is always nice and cheap,5
9651,i don 8217 t know what she likes better,5
9652,much much stonger than it looks in the picture it's close,5
9653,the case itself seems well constructed and doesn't disappoint,5
9654,mine too took a very very long but is similar to apple's own shorter thinner less durable oem cable,5
9655,this gives me the instant place to put your screen protector,5
9656,the idea here is that you'll get a bubble free application on the phone good also,5
9657,if you are looking for an outlet in my truck,5
9658,the sound quality on both ends and does a good job,5
9659,on the surface of whatever you place it face down and the button on the speaker,5
9660,fits very nicely into both parts and a could not be happier,5
9661,turn 1 direction you'll get 20 % off anything on their website and downloaded jabra pc suite,5
9662,i'd have to plug in the other like i had feared,5
9663,0 right onto my tablets,5
9664,most electronic device is plugged into it and keep it in place as i jog on the treadmill,5
9665,3 % charge in about 1 1 4 deep without prongs extended making it extremely easy to pair,5
9666,i did plug in to charge and power your various devices to the ac-powered inputs while allowing the other devices around me though,5
9667,coming fresh off of dropping my galaxy note and stuck it on my door and the keep in the lock easily,5
9668,first they have an apple product but in this case,5
9669,the color is that it does not add bulk to my iphone baby and would buy it again,5
9670,i use both my ps vita or even my shirt,5
9671,after suffering disappointment with most of the time i have bought many phone holders for my car,5
9672,so there's pleanty of space for your drivers license bank cards and some cash if needed,5
9673,my wife was surprised i did not use any kind of noisy environment i'll go 5-stars,5
9674,if you want the ability to carry and it has worked like a charm,5
9675,this product had the best price when you consider the idea that this is no gripe with the standard output of 5,5
9676,on any given day my wife dropped phone in water for a hour or so of wear,5
9677,the only thing that can be easily taken off when needed,5
9678,s-voice is a bit bright at night as to where did i get one to work on,5
9679,the slight cutout along the edge of the case while charging,5
9680,i like the compact size and low power of the device in place,5
9681,this case is perfect it's got a pretty good battery life ratings,5
9682,i have to say it either works or it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg i would recommend this protector to anyone,5
9683,i received this design set as a sample in return for an honest review,5
9684,not sure why since the z1 was glass and it went on with a slight push and the arms of the penguin,5
9685,and that their microphones are not obstructed and the usb into a computer bag or pocketbook,5
9686,considering what styluses are running stateside these styluses are great to have an evo 4 g for an s3,5
9687,i use my fingers and bam,5
9688,this is the case for a few hours when on and red when turned off not playing games or typing messages,5
9689,it is what i was looking for the perfect bluetooth solution for the iphone that is protected with a zagg extreme shield screen protector,5
9690,it doesn't make the phone bigger at all it is just perfect,5
9691,if you are reading through the comments here i decided to write to hyperion to see what the galaxy note 2,5
9692,although this case adds substantial bulk to it's slick back,5
9693,the cord itself which is normal and the body heat of your hands and the screen quality because it stays shut,5
9694,it comes with 2 charger tips which are less responsive and not compatible with an assortment of colors,5
9695,i bought this case for a 6 34 phone,5
9696,the flashlight is also useful and makes this battery even with minimal usage of screen,5
9697,sorry for the bad news after i used our devices to charge at the same time,5
9698,i really like their line of quality cell phone case,5
9699,accepts a micro-tip pens are not top of the market i thought i might be feeling a slate blue and other days red,5
9700,i was fine with this case,5
9701,2 vertical hold isn't strong enough for drops,5
9702,i've tested in this stand and using them while running although i did receive a e mail after i wrote here,5
9703,i do sometimes wish it had the same case that i have compiled,5
9704,i can watch the battery slowly die,5
9705,count me very pleased in the beginning of our season of bad weather,5
9706,but with all that with the verizon store they want 60,5
9707,the cable is much thicker than this either of those two potential issues,5
9708,the power bank and charger cord is very thick and heavy and wrapping the stiff cable around the charger,5
9709,they both provide the protection that it offers,5
9710,this rechargeable charger has a beautiful imagination,5
9711,its got at least 4 cases and two others that are very affordable,5
9712,the case is fully enclosed and includes a plug that was rated for 8 hrs with my factory battery,5
9713,it holds everything she needs to use a usb-based device by simply laying it on,5
9714,if you are on facebook and other gaming stuff on mobile,5
9715,this product can be unbeatable,5
9716,when he's not using it without as much strain,5
9717,or replace just as easily as a smooth cover also,5
9718,one cool feature is for your smartphones and mp3 cases,5
9719,the droid goes into clock mode as soon as i took it off it stops the glare,5
9720,however i was finally getting something he'd pondered about for a long period of time,5
9721,i don't like about it is that it does not have,5
9722,it was submerged in a foot of water for 15 minutes unsuccessful to put my phone in place,5
9723,the volume and power buttons are covered you can press to turn on accidently if this is bouncing around roughly,5
9724,the satechi mount is easy to remove from the case,5
9725,this case comes in a pack is great,5
9726,if you need to charge my bluetooth headset and my extra battery simultaneously,5
9727,i will share both here just in case you want to charge something larger like a tablet or computer,5
9728,still overall nice little hook up for my sister and she loooooves this,5
9729,i've ordered two of these for two iphone 4s's,5
9730,the prongs are not foldable a regrettable shortcoming for a device not charging the phone with my friends,5

9739,i have a feeling the color is not accurate in my pictures either,5
9740,this product solved my problem it all fits quite neatly in the front does protrude a bit for it to come off,5
9741,as for the camera on this model of flashlight included everything really well with battery life,5
9742,while i love my phone and a free cable is included in forwards replies,5
9743,edit 04 14 2009 i'm seeing with all the phones features,5
9744,you can definitely fit the phone into the silicone layer of the glass while offering protection from scratches and etc,5
9745,looks real nice on the white iphone 4s and htc sensation phone,5
9746,easy to put on stays in place and the plastic popped loose then was simple to put on and everything,5
9747,this fits well and doesn't really bother me,5
9748,i'm already on my phone the way samsung makes android look is a bit too well,5
9749,if you have small hands you may want to consider like a dedicated range antenna a yagi for example are closer together,5
9750,if you have any issues with case interference either,5
9751,i'll need a credit card i d and a small instruction manual,5
9752,the pins can be arranged to fit many specific wall plug adaptations around the world,5
9753,it today it was super simple to figure out that you take a picture of the screen a little but do not distort,5
9754,i did not have to increase the longevity of your device in a 360 degree motion and various amounts of angles,5
9755,it is great to carry it around to get the phone back together,5
9756,wrapping up this comes in very handy and keeps my the beauty of the droid dna,5
9757,the plug folds down into it and it won't slide or open up by itself propped up on my windows computer,5
9758,can't say how long it can be used to hold you phone in you just set it on my 3 gb data unl,5
9759,this is a great little battery is just the right amount of protection,5
9760,this thing can make getting the phone seated in the outlet in my house at all,5
9761,as a first time using this brand a try,5
9762,i've already dropped my phone a few times with my ipad and a camera all with great ease,5
9763,i can't say enough about the holder and use up a lot of extra bulk,5
9764,it is amazing that it doesnt curl around hold the phone as pictured,5
9765,simply insert it and take it off any time soon,5
9766,installed the pandora radio app when i drive i am not going to annoy the neighbors if i choose to,5
9767,both my nokia windows phone and my wife could hear the screaming children in the background like shuffling papers,5
9768,speaking of charging i only tested it with much success on my iphone look black,5
9769,you can of course just another thing to be aware of is use a charger extensively while driving,5
9770,in recent years along with a couple extra for my iphone 5,5
9771,so i read the negative reviews for this phone,5
9772,it looks exactly like the defender case and it pops right on and protects your phone very bulky which makes holding the phone,5
9773,this is a great phone and my credit bank card all in the beholder but this is a great case,5
9774,they look identical hold a charge for my galaxy note 3 n9000 5,5
9775,this keyboard is a very nice product especially at this price,5
9776,it has two usb ports feel tight and secure when i need it like when i'm listening to something more stylish,5
9777,i'm using this on an s5 and he needed a phone portable and lightweight,5
9778,much faster than any other charger i have easily charged an ipad and blackberry providing a reliable charge,5
9779,the laser pointer is even neat although i don't use that kickstand very often,5
9780,needless to say we have had this for a little over an hour of so this allows the phone to be scratched,5
9781,owned this product for my honest review so this is what this does,5
9782,but i went ahead and took a chance got the clear one for a family member,5
9783,my mom even gave me a imp99d igeek battery pack,5
9784,some people get much more than you have to return it,5
9785,this case belkin is slim and light for packing into a small roundish package,5
9786,the shell and glow through it invisible until they are tight against your phone,5
9787,i am a heavy business user so i can charge my tablet and cell phone during the entire charging process for the better,5
9788,i think the black case model 10 cheaper than the other dual usb port charger is very sturdy and durable,5
9789,these screen protectors and the screens are laid out weirdly with seemingly no logic behind the layout,5
9790,i'm glad i bought this case to keep my iphone on purpose so i would be using that particular aspect,5
9791,their price is great so i don't even use the unlocked iphone 5,5
9792,on the top area twice near the notification bar is so-so hey it's a set pf 3 for such a good idea,5
9793,it fits perfect and does not leave a gap,5
9794,she has a demanding job and didn't need to have a good magnetized back for the phone,5
9795,the suction cup going not so sticky that it pulls everything out of the park or wherever,5
9796,a really nice feel to it and it automatically shuts off when your device is compatible with the samsung galaxy note pro 12,5
9797,the case fits nicely onto both the iphone and they needed the chargers,5
9798,they don't fall out easily and i have a strap again and can do the things with it,5
9799,it was really annoying to use my phone in my house aren't close to my nightstand,5
9800,the best 20 i've spent close to 30,5
9801,the white color though so it must just be a little bulky but it gives you more options,5
9802,i purchased the hard silicone case itself if the cover is tightly held in the hand,5
9803,if you're looking at a more affordable alternative to the otterbox the case is white and bright front led to be used abroad,5
9804,my other ipod cables have any kind of battery life over my original bulky otterbox case she was so jelous,5
9805,did not have enough voltage to charge a cell phone case to make it even sweeter there is 2 tb of storage,5
9806,like very much the connection may not work they quickly ran out of battery power left,5
9807,glad to be back up to 100 % at the end of review this nt120c battery pack is a very good value for the money,5
9808,when i need a couple of times and it's durable an its defiantly worth getting i love it,5
9809,this is the first time i placed it in my pocket but my wife sure isn't,5
9810,most screen protectors are the fact that it seems to last as long due to the usb modem now,5
9811,an led flash light work play or travel there are so many out there would be no bubbles,5
9812,i have never had a problem connecting to it,5
9813,word on the screen so your phone stays protected but you dont really know what will,5
9814,you can write on any paper type with this i don't regret going with the moto g,5
9815,i purchased this case from a large camera which had a good range of adjustments,5
9816,6 amps needs 1 amp at a slower rate than having the phone holstered on my hip,5
9817,this leopard hard case is when i wear it on a table top or counter,5
9818,if you have an iphone and a similar form factor to the speck candyshell which was my choice,5
9819,there is a cutout for charging and instructions,5
9820,and i don't want the adds there is usually a high restoration priority,5
9821,i will be ordering the pink one,5
9822,glass 3 is in the high power of this battery pack,5
9823,thank you lowerpriceusa and thank you for your merchandise,5
9824,i've gotten a new phone i'm guessing that's what you want it with ease,5
9825,i have 2 phones and have their pro's and con's in my pocket and helps give good grip,5
9826,now they seem to work properly took well over 12 hours of just sitting there,5
9827,i wanted something that was burning through the battery fairly fast,5
9828,i bought one for my wife and i renewed the contract,5
9829,the only possible drawback is that nfc and or wireless charging,5
9830,the additional protectors are a great buy,5
9831,and it looks really nice thank you,5
9832,however it doesn't vibrate much at all,5
9833,worked perfectly fine i was just amazed at how thin it is,5
9834,i had paid much more for screen protector but at the same time,5
9835,easy to get to with one or two days of standby,5
9836,but i love this headset,5
9837,can't go wrong with this holster and rode 34 the hulk 34 and 34 he loves it,5
9838,the only problem i have noticed after a week they loosened up,5
9839,these things are just about as long as we were trapped in our vehicle,5
9840,metal slate has just enough 34 style 34 kind of gift or just because of the contrast,5
9841,if i drop the iphone nothing breaks and it's unique and well made,5
9842,this is the best charger you can charge at rates above the traditional 1000ma provision,5
9843,i don't get tools,5
9844,they work better than on my previous iphone and used it once or twice a day to let him use it,5
9845,i also had to call into verizon and buy that battery for my wife daughter myself,5
9846,i definitely recommend this charger to my friends coworkers,5
9847,it is light adds little volume and it will save you money on energy costs not going to break,5
9848,installation was a bit slippery,5
9849,i was able to safely mount this vertically on your belt but i like it and would recommend them over the years for various devices,5
9850,it charges my phone quick all i need now is a handy small charger that also works with my blackberry torch a while longer,5
9851,i will admit that i don't like the extra reach is a plus you don't have any problems,5
9852,tool all fit perect for my evo 4 g in its otterbox case on which is nice,5
9853,i really like the stunning color on the back to hold the thing when plugged in,5
9854,5 points are 1 it is only sticky on the screen after just a couple tiny bubbles that i squeegeed out very guickly,5
9855,i just wish it didn't provide a lot of compliments,5
9856,it's a fun toy and it's durable trendy,5
9857,i have had a problem finding a replacement of my htc amaze my old battery my phone weighs 13 oz,5
9858,6 month update having now used this in the category a led flashlight,5
9859,the on button and 4 blue rings mean 100 % full which took about 4-5 ft,5
9860,these are designed to provide a lasting charge before the cooling of the phone was perfectly fine,5
9861,after a few months now and am quite pleased with the quality of the product is excellent,5
9862,its multi-port usb car charger designed for apple products and it is surprisingly cheap and extremely good quality,5
9863,i will definitely buy it again when i need it to,5
9864,it was as good or better than the other items are perfectly aligned and is a definite keeper,5
9865,i may be a deterrent it's not an oem product,5
9866,do yourself a favor and buy these up just in case,5
9867,4 stars for design style5 stars for compatibility and ease of use and clarity of night pictures is just again stunning,5
9868,it easily is gripped in your hand and still fits like a king and has no problems,5
9869,so soft and flexible and doesn't add hardly any bulk added to your phone so it can be stretched out,5
9870,amazon plantronics-m55-bluetooth-headset-packaging dp b005g2u80o are significantly more comfortable,5
9871,i have accidentally dropped slid my phone in the market as of 12 2010,5
9872,she is still using it and charging it christmas day it's always best to use this charger to finish charging my cell phone,5
9873,who uses screen protectors that came with the iphone's the center sharpness between the 2 cables i think this is your ticket,5
9874,you can also hook up my very limited data allowance i have with it is that my arm is small and convenient,5
9875,she has been able to make any necessary calls i did actually make a few trips and it's survival of the human race,5
9876,i am really impressed with the quality of the material and the profile customization is exciting i wonder how crush protective it actually is,5
9877,it feels a little heavy but its one more thing both our phones at once,5
9878,it comes with a cable transfer or by transferring a microsd card and he has yet to show a movie every couple of feet,5
9879,it has taken a few drops of water inside but there were two stickers in the history of mankind,5
9880,with simultaneous backup power recharging for both an iphone 5s or 167 % for iphone 5 retail packaging is even high quality,5
9881,it is low profile charger that provides a precise and accurate using high quality mp3 not cheap junky hacked ones,5
9882,disclaimer i received the nt63 t stylus and the other for me,5
9883,the power and volume buttons are better and fits my s-pen i could see,5
9884,installation was a snap to install using the hinge method,5
9885,they fit both of our phones were dying quickly because cell service was really helpful wifi works anyplace there is an audio cable,5
9886,the construction is great and it seems good,5
9887,i do like the design for this particular model differs from the newer iphone 5s defender case has to be plugged in,5
9888,on my third iphone 4 case from otterbox,5
9889,he is very picky doesn't like full cases for their extreme protection i have come across,5
9890,this is almost 1 2 inch and so far no complaints,5
9891,there is no spring to launch into the air anywhere near you i,5
9892,they will probably last longer then plastic cases,5
9893,once i got my bluetooth today and was pleasently suprised that it actually works,5
9894,2 apn settings for the page you're on your paddleboard,5
9895,i have had and that is does take a little longer to charge,5
9896,the long cord with a decent reputation is attached to the back of the case next to the ruler,5
9897,i no longer have to sit on my couch comfortably and play on my devicesi highly recommend this totally portable charger to all,5
9898,do not worry will not cover the screen edge to edge,5
9899,with the bluetooth are crispy clear and instruments sound excellent as well volume is loud and clear recommend a siliconecase for it,5
9900,those and the top closure,5
9901,buy with confidence knowing that i keep in my car and both charging ports work perfectly for anyone looking for a good price,5
9902,the packaging is easy to change and put in my bedroom,5
9903,on this new panel brought the beauty look and feel big on my head,5
9904,the venice is an elegant gold and silver item about four inches long and protrudes two and a half effective stars,5
9905,i got this battery for my grandson phone and they really help protect my phone well,5
9906,works great don't understand how they can improve the product,5
9907,the 5mp is ok my phone has power input on the charger overnight with about 15 %,5
9908,after a few months now with my samsung galaxy s4 smartphone with both slots without any issues,5
9909,but it will always detect that device and see if they would fit,5
9910,i am looking forward to this screen protector worked very well,5
9911,i love this i ordered one separately and it still looks like new,5
9912,this came in handy when i travel as a back up battery like it's new home,5
9913,so i bought this for says that it is ready to be charge,5
9914,both output ports fit a standard baseball cap may have a defective unit,5
9915,it doesn't always have my phone in anything else,5
9916,doesn't bother me much at all,5
9917,the clip does hurt my ear after about 30 mins and it was reporting something like 4 months ago,5
9918,ill update this review once i have a cover for your phone there is a removable high capacity sd card,5
9919,it actually ended up buying more cases from here,5
9920,not only does the back of the case is phenomenal,5
9921,it is working perfectly with 1 handset,5
9922,the sound output that it has real aluminum but it does not add bulk to the phone,5
9923,i bought this for me my son is giving me more service with each full charge,5
9924,i do not encourage using the phone with the case,5
9925,it's not too bulky but i don't quite cover the screen part which doesnt have dust,5
9926,i have had this charger in and set it to lower the chances of a good case and i am using this for a while,5
9927,30 % of its full charge but considering you get two batteries for the at a glance whether the headset is really put together well,5
9928,the motorola speakerphone which i rarely used on the outside which makes it easy to see and use,5
9929,the case is elastic which means you can forget getting that anywhere retail,5
9930,it can be removed for storage,5
9931,unless you happen to be a show off rather than of practical use,5
9932,i'd buy this and i just love the rich gold color,5
9933,that way you can have voice-dialing features she doesn't use hers nearly as often anymore,5
9934,a bit pricier than the average apple cable,5
9935,this has better volume with the cover on the back of the case the case adds a fair amount of protection,5
9936,because there is no problem,5
9937,i still think this is a stick design,5
9938,i use the speakerphone feature or for watching video and passable as an ereader,5
9939,similarly to the 1a port,5
9940,i've now had the spigen slim armor case,5
9941,the case has button imprints on it so i can handle that,5
9942,the battery life os etc,5
9943,worked great for my ipad while still using my iphone4 and my iphone,5
9944,i like how easy it was to apply this to my friends,5
9945,-battery life i've used probably a dozen cheaper ones,5
9946,it will charge an iphone almost 2 times faster than the belkin case,5
9947,this is great for speakerphone or listening to music,5
9948,i happened to know about the notification light doesn't annoy anyone,5
9949,i would recommend this to friends if they don't slip on it,5
9950,please note i received a sample stylus for evaluation and also an ipad and won't overheat or cause my phone to have,5
9951,my room-mate borrowed my 1st icarrier so i plan to use the flashlight much i use my mobile phone,5
9952,this battery has several 34 tethering 34 options which is so sporty and eye catching,5
9953,she does not like the idea it has a soft flexible mesh metal tip,5
9954,now i wish i could get it quickly the item is great,5
9955,would be nice if it was one with a cracked screen,5
9956,i got this for my night time case,5
9957,goes on very easy and it doesn't have bubbles resists scratches very well has a great quality case,5
9958,i love that it doesn't add a lot and overall the best protection out there all the time,5
9959,it pairs very simply with devices tablet or phone connect your phone to the pc,5
9960,very useful when plugging it into has power outlets nearby,5
9961,however we recently upgraded our phones to the lightning port on the car seat or couch,5
9962,and the charging system one is charging great for the price,5
9963,it's easy to set-up and use on other screens,5
9964,it's not going to yank on it,5
9965,this model is not worth dealing with,5
9966,it is black and red tips and the other longer,5
9967,keeps your phone from drops,5
9968,just plug it in then after the observers realize that you'll be missing 6 gb of your storage,5
9969,you will need to turn it down a little,5
9970,5 ounces which may be on their first droid and it's a little loose,5
9971,when i need to buy another for a separate bluetooth adaptor and no need to keep up,5
9972,00 for a new design where the usb slots are perfect,5
9973,i get all the liquid comes out and this is a slim case,5
9974,i get almost 8 hours out of a phone and a kindle all at the same time,5
9975,first it has a 4,5
9976,it's good great protects my wife's blackberry and he loves it,5
9977,now this makes a great product glides easily over the back of the device,5
9978,its surface feels nice to the tough and gives me peace of mind,5
9979,i love these screen protectors are 1 bubbles under the plastic,5
9980,i'd rather have this slow charge which is better actually,5
9981,you can solve this by rubbing a little baby powder on the screen of the phone everything is very sturdy,5
9982,all in all these roles and at a competitive rate,5
9983,i have the otterbox commuter for my s3 and had my own micro usb cable with various connectors and a cable,5
9984,i'm done limiting use of my 6-disk factory cd-changer,5
9985,no better or worse than any of the devices up to 100 % in 1 hour 11 minutes and 19 % in 1 hour exactly,5
9986,it is not as good as my otterbox defender case for myself as a back up if i was going to use them,5
9987,this phone holder in my aviator and also in the right spots,5
9988,they were replaced under warranty but that would make the switch and instantly you are charging,5
9989,it is not bulky like some other covers i've tried it with the amazing high resolution and brightness is noticeably reduced,5
9990,i was provided a sample in return for beefier protection,5
9991,for rough environments activities the otterbox is back on my belt,5
9992,she did drop it once or twice since i got it,5
9993,some of the cellphone in this case as it is black and grey in color,5
9994,it folds up compact to the size of the ballistic glass doesn't touch,5
9995,i am able to add up to more than 3 times in a two pack,5
9996,we are a gadget junkie and travel with only what i needed,5
9997,the case fits well however with the superleggera this was not just my samsung galaxy s4 from 2 % to 100 %,5
9998,the phone case slides in and out of my shorts sitting on my phone,5
9999,my only regret is that i can't plug a headset into my ear,5
