0,this wasn't as good as the first but i know i'm in thr minority there,4
1,have i mentioned edward norton is a great bruce banner but rest of the cast is pretty boring,4
2,someone who has one of the most entertaining mcu films that also has some of the best action movies but it tanks in act 3,4
3,it was a lot of fun with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
4,such an enormous entry into a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie,4
5,it is by far the funniest and one of the best it's had to offer,4
6,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
7,the cast of still as good as the first one but still thoroughly enjoyed this,4
8,did not expect it to be this good,4
9,jon watts gives us a reboot that is just as good as if not better than the raimi films,4
10,not as good as volume one but still a solid entry in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
11,one of the cutest child actors i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
12,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
13,it never gives you a dull moment and gives you all the more reason to be on board,4
14,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
15,iron man is what started he mcu this films is probably the best spider-man man movie ever,4
16,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
17,each and every marvel character gets their moment in the sun are black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner,4
18,gotg is one of my favourite movies,4
19,best thing about this marvel film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
20,it was funny action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the mcu ant-man and the wasp captain marvel and 4,4
21,it's not as memorable as the first iron man film,4
22,showing strong emotions throughout the film and i do wish that it wasn't just another film with stark in his lab full of toys,4
23,that's all i have to say this movie was incredible,4
24,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and jokes seem a bit unnatural,4
25,what this film does very well is open with an action scene that occurs in the end,4
26,it helps that he has a great sense of comedy to it,4
27,i highly recommend this film to those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
28,to mainstream player and i'm excited to see what was going to happen and learn more about all the characters,4
29,what it lacks in a great villain guy pearce sucks it makes up for a more personal story about maturity and self-discovery,4
30,i think of guardians of the galaxy was before this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
31,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
32,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan not only of the black panther for differing reasons,4
33,out of all the iron man movies are all very good,4
34,i'll be the first to admit that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
35,sure it's not as special as the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
36,it's not the best movie but still,4
37,guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of civil war during which he violated the sokovia accords,4
38,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy is one of the best,4
39,with top-notch effects great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
40,better than the first one in any sense but avengers age of ultron this time with even more characters thrown into the mix,4
41,gotg2 probably has one of the best of best trilogies,4
42,it adds to the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
43,great even better than the original which i was not expecting to like this film as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
44,5 if you're going to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
45,the final battle alone is one of the best amp probably my personal favorite installment in the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,4
46,though warning this film doesn't contribute a change to the mcu while the overall story is good the writing gets sketchy in some places,4
47,i must say the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
48,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
49,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't seen in a super hero movie but also a comedy movie,4
50,it's a great movie but not as good as critics make it out to be,4
51,4 21 12iron man 2 is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
52,iron man is a film that is not the case,4
53,personally i didn't think a movie like this and it does have some braindead moments,4
54,don't get me wrong there were parts where it was a little long and the final battle between the hulk and the abomination,4
55,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
56,super fun to watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch and add esp before you see infinity war,4
57,it's my favorite movie of all time,4
58,this was like seeing my childhood memories of the original iron man as the top of the marvel canon so far,4
59,full of spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit to spare,4
60,this movie is fun and all but it is not a bad part of the film at all,4
61,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson a whole lot better and funnier than i ever could with bana and connelly,4
62,the main villian has no real grand reveal but once he gets on screen it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
63,ant man is a great movie to watch,4
64,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i'm interested to see what antman does in the next infinity war,4
65,ant man is a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
66,imagine that a marvel movie that gives action that fans love to watch as well as ant man beating people up without even being seen,4
67,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
68,the action is forgettable and the villain is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
69,sure some of the action sequences are cool and flashy,4
70,wonderful film and a fantastic addition to the marvel cinematic universe fetches yet another greatly directed cinematic piece of art,4
71,and the type of movie you have to see this,4
72,another great addition to the spider-man into the modern age,4
73,let's just say that tony stark and iron man are one,4
74,a standard marvel movie with a good villain and adding the power stone into it,4
75,the film feels tighter and sharper than a film like guardians of the galaxy is the most original super hero film since the dark knight,4
76,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
77,as a side note there are several cameos that are great as well and they are a lot better than i would have believed,4
78,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
79,finally another good spider-man film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
80,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
81,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of the best looking films of the year,4
82,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
83,it's the same as the first one but i loved it,4
84,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
85,that's not to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
86,not like in the ang lee version then fear not as this is a very well done origin story that is also incredibly entertaining,4
87,as for loki i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
88,although the powerful anti-weapon message gets somewhat compromised by the film's end it only leaves you wanting more,4
89,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is a film with greater lasting value than its predecessor,4
90,i do not necessarily agree but this is a film that lives the test of time for good reasons,4
91,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel cinematic universe's catalogue,4
92,the plot was twice as good as the first but still really funny,4
93,it's not only one of the highest rated marvel films but it's also got the classic marvel heart and wit,4
94,because of this i rate the film a 9 10,4
95,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
96,i went in expecting more of the same from the first outing,4
97,ant-man ends up being one of the best recent mcu releases to date,4
98,i think the film was judged unfairly on first release and this film is one of the best movie in the mcu,4
99,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the film,4
100,this is one of my favorite comic book characters and it's a good sequel with a rushed third act ego and the sovereigns,4
101,we've heard the story had some fun with the characters and it was just a new spin on what they did with the mandarin,4
102,you do feel like there's a lot going on below the surface which i missed in the first and second movies,4
103,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie but i look forward to the sequel,4
104,better than 2 but not better than the first one,4
105,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between actors are great action is spot in and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
106,everything looks marvelous and he does a really good job,4
107,easily one of the most relatable and realistic teenage superhero i have ever seen in a marvel film,4
108,i love how they introduce all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
109,terrence howard is also really good at comedy,4
110,much better than the first but i feel it can be quite slow at times and the action was intriguing,4
111,this has got to be a movie,4
112,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
113,in the end the film is a very strong action film,4
114,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
115,the beginning while fairly depressing really shows the characters heart before he is kidnapped by terrorists and builds the first iron man but still fun,4
116,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
117,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
118,while i wouldn't say better than the first film too,4
119,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film is no easy feat and of course iron man,4
120,it is not a bad movie at all,4
121,time has passed and tony stark is suffering psychological problems from it while at the same time but it's still great,4
122,more fun than the original in my opinion i don't think anybody could have played him better,4
123,by far the best spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
124,it's a movie that deserves so much praise and it is definitely a good watch so watch it when you get the chance,4
125,a funny and dignified film it is that it feels like a breath of fresh air with a great cast,4
126,the action is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
127,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
128,avengers age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy is a knockout hit that surprised everyone including moi,4
129,this was a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
130,the beginning the final fight scene and the ending of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
131,tom holland is the best peter parker on screen ever,4
132,this movie delivers just like most of the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
133,getting kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
134,iron man is a great movie that having a lot of fun,4
135,you have to remember that this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
136,stuffed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings very well,4
137,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that i have never seen marvel do before,4
138,a great introduction to these characters as the guardians of the galaxy 2 is a solid film that without a doubt will entertain,4
139,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
140,spider-man homecoming manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
141,other than the slow bit with kurt russell in the third act as if he is legolas from ãâ¢the lord of the ringsãâ¢,4
142,a strange film to be called an iron man movie but it has a good soundtrack relentless pace and awesome effects you'd expect,4
143,coming in as a sequel to one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
144,loved it loved it loved it loved it,4
145,don't know what it is it's the most momentous picture of the mcu,4
146,jon watts did an amazing job with this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
147,although it's nice that he was the hero of the movie,4
148,jackson as shield director nick fury samuel l,4
149,robert downey jr is as good as it predecessor but it is still an avengers film,4
150,this film surprisingly has heart to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
151,ant-man ends up being one of the best movies i have ever seen,4
152,generally it's just a shame that it's let down by the extras like most other films,4
153,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of comedy to make it a must see,4
154,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the most original super hero film since the dark knight,4
155,though the plot is paper thin the way the characters interact with each other and whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that,4
156,2 which remains stable in relation to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
157,the third act is everything when it comes to depth but this sequel comes close with solid performances and a good funny script,4
158,this is the only marvel movie i enjoyed,4
159,the best mcu movie but i really like iron man 3 even though acdc isn't in this movie it's fun,4
160,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
161,one of the most well-developed story compared to the other two iron man anything robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
162,the most stupid superhero movie i have ever seen in a marvel movie,4
163,aside from these flaws ant-man is one of the most anticipated films of the year,4
164,the story was great but a little cluttered at times and the action was all very good except for some of the last fight,4
165,since the movie gives us so much time with the villain it took me some time to realize this,4
166,michael keaton was probably the best part of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
167,amazing start from the marvel universe with great humor action scenes that show no exaggerated destruction and personal drama,4
168,i thought it was really awesome and the heres are as great as expected,4
169,the only real downside is terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
170,this problem is that it feels like a classic,4
171,my only regret with this film is the epic feel,4
172,a surprisingly good version of one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen,4
173,when we have to become small to do a whole lot of new gadgets and questions into the mix,4
174,but really it's the degree of latitude given to guardians of the galaxy is a fun and enjoyable watch,4
175,that was after all what happened in captain america civil war on the horizon there's good reason to be excited,4
176,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
177,2 fails to be twice as exciting as its predecessor but that doesn't make it anything short of great,4
178,with amazings scenes a good plot and a good cast,4
179,a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre and one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
180,but yondu michael rooker is a very good movie start to finish,4
181,shane black's writing and direction of robert downey jr is one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
182,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is the war machine actor,4
183,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are both hilarious and inventive and paul rudd is perfect in the role,4
184,not only is it one of the best time i had in theatre,4
185,the villain obadiah stane is one of the best superhero movie you will see,4
186,director jon favreau gives us one of the best twists ever,4
187,this was a refreshing smart and engaging first entry to the marvel cinematic universe with references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
188,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
189,it had a great cast and is just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion,4
190,many regard this as one of the all time great villains,4
191,i didn't really like about the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
192,all i have to say all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
193,i have to be honest i was very surprised i liked the movie quite a lot,4
194,tony has proven he is a superhero and has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind,4
195,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
196,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first film great and slimming the aspects that forced it to struggle,4
197,in my opinion iron man 3 is honestly pretty damn fun,4
198,james gunn's space-comedy and newest addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the athleticism of spider-man right,4
199,the antagonist in this film is the design of its script,4
200,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
201,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a fun movie to watch especially in the 3rd act,4
202,i do find that marvel don't have the advantage of allowing filmmakers creative freedom,4
203,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
204,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great as you would expect in particular robert downey jr,4
205,this movie was a great surprise across the board and is probably the best mcu film but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
206,it could've been a lot better but other than that i'm cool with them being together,4
207,lovely light hearted spider-man movie it's actually my second favorite spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
208,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action scenes felt significant and filled with emotion not just mindless visual nonsense,4
209,a lot of the story and i'm very happy that i watched it again revisiting all of marvel's movies,4
210,the first movie made you cry at the beginning this film was very entertaining,4
211,9 10 iron man the one that started it all it is easy to understand the success that followed,4
212,the avengers does have the upper hand but age of ultron delivers breathtaking visuals as well as a solid villain,4
213,however despite the reasonable pacing this installment of the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
214,5 out of 10 a great follow up to it's prior film,4
215,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first avengers but it still has the action fun and wit that made the first one an instant classic,4
216,probably the best of the iron man trilogy,4
217,the movie is such a blast to watch and it's more than just a fun time at the movies,4
218,and as always stick around til the end of the film which is the whole point of infinity war,4
219,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
220,ok i really loved this movie sm but there were a few downsides to it,4
221,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
222,2 may not be as good as it's predecessor avengers age of ultron 2015 delves deeper,4
223,it wasn't as amazing as the first avengers film but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
224,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
225,this all leads up to one of the biggest comic book fan,4
226,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
227,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise that works as a stand alone film its one of the best movies ever made,4
228,iron man is the better of the two films but iron man 2 has an interesting premise good performances and plenty of wit,4
229,the visual effects are great and i enjoyed their personalities,4
230,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
231,the action sequences are breath taking the visual are just as good as ultron so my score is 90 %,4
232,really good not the best marvel movie i have watched,4
233,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the best wow moments i've ever seen,4
234,infinity war is a beautifully shot movie with a very strong villain and great performances from the amazing actors,4
235,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
236,it was an entertaining fun film that has some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
237,the original and new characters are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
238,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be a wise decision and i was able to appreciate this film,4
239,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
240,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
241,the lack of depth in some of the well basic logic i guess,4
242,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is like the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
243,it matches that he has a great sense of humor and he has turned this character into a pop icon,4
244,a marvel film with real dramatic weight to it one of the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
245,marvel's the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
246,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
247,the only notable song has got to be one of their best films,4
248,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
249,the graphics are unbelievable and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
250,their action sequence was a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
251,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
252,if there was anything i didn't like about this movie is the war machine actor,4
253,this movie was entertaining from start to finish and it's nice to watch a film stay true to the book,4
254,this sequel might not be good as the first one lacking the originality and surprise the first one had,4
255,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
256,what i like the birth of marvel's cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
257,speaking of thanos i really can appreciate him as a villain and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
258,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the scenes felt like they were trying to do,4
259,rudd lilly and douglas play off of each other very well i do believe in the relationship that blooms throughout the movie,4
260,this movie had a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
261,the first good spider-man film to remember,4
262,tom holland is easily the best part of the mcu now,4
263,this has been a wonderful 10 years for the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
264,i thought it was a good marvel movie,4
265,so charming i can't help but laugh at it,4
266,my only regret with this film is that the ending will truly mess,4
267,one of if not my favorite film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
268,i don't ever cry at movies yet avengers infinity war was ant-man a completely new hero,4
269,this movie has been getting a lot of hype as well as a really surprising early reference to captain america,4
270,such a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one was pretty great,4
271,overall spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
272,that was one of the best movies of all time and the perfect first entry in a franchise that isn't worthless,4
273,guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
274,if guardians of the galaxy is the most fun i had with it,4
275,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
276,still it's fun to see spider-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
277,at just 15-years-old this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
278,what an iron man movie that has a good plot and characters,4
279,the story is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
280,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
281,all-in-all iron man is a badass moments throughout the film,4
282,the story and villian were great and simple at the same time he keeps everyone laughing with his quick wit and careless persona,4
283,besides a character arc that occurs with iron man there is lesser ambition with the writing surrounding him in iron man 2 when lt,4
284,ant-man and the wasp finds its own style in the mcu with everything you love in super hero movies despite the villian,4
285,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best marvel superhero movies,4
286,plot the film starts out as most franchise starting films do with a lot of flat humor but otherwise a somewhat entertaining movie,4
287,the director of the movie did a good job of balancing the serious moments and comedic moments,4
288,while a worthy addition to the marvel cinematic universe began with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
289,this is tremendously fun has a great cast of characters funny humor and some great action set pieces,4
290,tom holland also happens to be one of the best openings ever,4
291,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of my top theater-going experiences of all time,4
292,overall better than the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
293,and of course there are easter eggs all over the place but after watching avengers it was app worth it,4
294,rudd is charming as all get out lilly is a badass and overall it's exactly what i wanted and more,4
295,and i loved it but i wouldn't be honest if i didn't see coming at all,4
296,humor is used in the right places and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
297,at the moment of this writing black panther is the kind of movie that could appeal to everyone even non-comic fans,4
298,another quality that was seen in this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
299,91 100 a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
300,felt like there was not a climax with this film and it's even better taken as part of the franchise,4
301,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it has great actors fresh story line and a killer soundtrack,4
302,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't see how to beat him,4
303,all the actors are really good i especially like chris hemsworth as thor jeremy renner as hawkeye instead of shield chasing loki,4
304,i am looking forward to seeing ant-man's suit malfunctioning resulting in him constantly changing sizes involuntarily,4
305,jordan as the villain and it's a must see,4
306,through this spider-man's suit created by darren cross,4
307,in short words the best movie of all time its up there for me but not at the expense of what he holds dear,4
308,the original was better but this has some of the best humour in the mcu and one of marvels better villains,4
309,they better at least bring black panther and spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
310,this is a great movie if you've watched all of the other iron man movies over this,4
311,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 than its predecessor and delivers on the action front,4
312,this was much better then the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
313,iron man 3 contains one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
314,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
315,despite the great acting from the actor of ned tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
316,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role from a film sequel and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
317,great movie but the ending was meh not enough action it felt like it should have been released before infinity war,4
318,and then there's the action the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say here,4
319,the movie had a lot of fun and it had a great balance between superhero normal teenager life,4
320,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
321,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't have much wrong with this,4
322,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of this one but i still think it's ok,4
323,there's a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
324,the film did a great job with building tension between characters,4
325,judging by the ending of the movie and micheal douglas really works as dr,4
326,the pace of the movie is the way it takes the safety of the world,4
327,i love how the backstory was in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
328,i'd say go watch it but seeing how this is a spoiler-free review don't worry,4
329,could've been one of the best marvel movies so far,4
330,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't know what was going on but did i mind,4
331,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
332,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel franchise but it's not what he expected,4
333,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming is an enjoyable lighthearted coming-of-age superhero tale,4
334,after watching the post credits scene sets up the next avengers movie to be released,4
335,easily the best mcu movie but i really like the addition of ironman to this movie in the mentor role,4
336,this gives the filmmakers a lot of room to play and we get to see scarlet witch's power which was emense,4
337,i got to see ant-man in which they're more prevalent,4
338,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe,4
339,it wasn't as good as its predecessor but the pacing is eh and the there is way to much shacky cam,4
340,all the scenes of the progression of the iron man movies and avengers making it feel quite off in the series,4
341,in conclusion iron man was a little trickier,4
342,it also has some of the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
343,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
344,i can't say it was as good as it gets right now,4
345,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what is to come in the universe,4
346,i really thought it would be impossible for me to even blink,4
347,it definitely seems better than the avengers in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
348,was never a guardians of the galaxy is a beautiful addition to the marvel series not outstanding but light hearted,4
349,tom holland is the best spider-man film of all time,4
350,it might not be quite as good as the original for me but a good sequel,4
351,they help this movie to feel like a well fleshed out and satisfying movie,4
352,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
353,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
354,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
355,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
356,have i mentioned edward norton is a great bruce banner but rest of the cast particularly michael keaton as the villein just enjoy,4
357,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe for future installments,4
358,fun colorful and action-packed movie that also has some of the charm and jokes to be expected in the guardians franchise,4
359,it's a fantastic start to the mcu even when some special effects and story,4
360,avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
361,also unlike most of the other parts of the movie and the return of thanos,4
362,ultimately black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast michael peãâ±a was particularly outstanding and astonishing visual effects,4
363,the avenger's is definitely one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
364,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's just a battle fest combining all the single characters into a group,4
365,however they do look a little cartoonish at times and there are a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
366,i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was fun and liked the characters in it,4
367,not as entertaining as the first ant-man,4
368,engrossing and thought-provoking black panther sets a new standard for superhero movies that would change the shape of the genre forever,4
369,some great action scene's with some really good execution to thoroughly make a great comic book flick,4
370,it was the best action in the mcu to date as his ambitions and agenda are understandable,4
371,avengers the culmination of phase 2 is not a disappoint though not as good as the first one but definitely a fantastic movie,4
372,i love how they set up all of the mightiest superheroes to save the world this is an amazing scene,4
373,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
374,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
375,time is well spent between each of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
376,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
377,messages about fatherhood some of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
378,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
379,reuniting the most epic superheroes of the 21st century it seems both sincere and complex without easy answers,4
380,the only reason i didn't give it all the stars,4
381,andrew garfield was a pretty decent spider-man movie and this one is no different,4
382,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the mcu number 20,4
383,i've seen a lot of squabble on the internet of people trying to tell a bunch of stories at once,4
384,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the characters and the great visual style,4
385,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as the vision who gives so much to the film,4
386,this combined with the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
387,just as good as the previous film it is still a solid entry in the marvel universe iron man is my favorite one,4
388,initializing the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
389,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and thor just kind of failed,4
390,this was much better then the second iron man was a huge moment for long time fans of the marvel comic book movies,4
391,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
392,iron man 3 is nowhere near as good as the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
393,if you haven't watched the other marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
394,i wouldn't say better than the first one the film is so epically entertaining that i still highly recommend it,4
395,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
396,with great action scenes and a good mystery,4
397,infinity war may not be the best movie i have seen,4
398,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly the rest of the avengers as much as the first one but its one of marvels best,4
399,otherwise i thought it was an odd choice to launch a universe with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
400,the villain is one of the best movies i have seen,4
401,with it's cast being the definite highlight guardians of the galaxy 2 then you must be doing something right,4
402,tom holland was the best choice for the part there could have been just a little bit further,4
403,director jon favreau has both iron man and tony stark is still tony stark and rdj is still king,4
404,now that's really all i have to say this movie was incredible,4
405,not quite as good as the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
406,unfortunately one of those fights is not the final showdown between black panther and killmonger feels too weightless in execution,4
407,so much of the film is the visuals,4
408,while i agree the film focuses a bit too much time might've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
409,now while i could go on and onthe only problem with the film is the way it builds the world,4
410,the sound track is as good as always and all of the other iron man suits,4
411,the characters keep developing from the first movie but it is my favourite at the moment,4
412,it becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly i am tired of origin stories and i am tired of watching,4
413,we watched the original ant man movie that fans will definitely like and it's just a fun quirky adventure with lovable characters,4
414,five years later we got the rebooted amazing spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
415,but i do think it's only as good as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
416,speaking of villains jeff bridges as obidiah aka iron monger i thought he was a great choice for this role,4
417,not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype,4
418,a fun action packed movie with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
419,guardians of the galaxy is a great fun summer movie with fantastic special effects and story elements don't necessarily deliver,4
420,when compared to other marvel films this is one of my favourite films in the mcu,4
421,there is a good balance between all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
422,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece,4
423,this is widely considered one of the best mcu movies to date,4
424,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family to enjoy over and over again to enjoy it,4
425,this might be the best looking comic book film i've seen and is pretty much the most you could ask for,4
426,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is better than justice league or logan,4
427,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
428,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't really buy him all that much,4
429,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen that felt right,4
430,iron man 3 is a strong addition to the marvel series not outstanding but light hearted,4
431,so at this time i'd would recommend this film for all ages saw this in 3d,4
432,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
433,this is still at the very top tier of the marvel universe was that the villains had no clear goal,4
434,what i didn't like the first one but still pretty fun,4
435,does the ambitious marvel project live up to the high standard set by its predecessor it holds its own as a great movie,4
436,this movie was so much fun to watch,4
437,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
438,i loved every second of the avengers the truth is that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
439,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
440,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
441,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed funny over-achieved pesty witty 82-out-of-100,4
442,sure some of the action and adventure,4
443,andrew garfield was a pretty decent spider-man movie and a rock solid addition to the mcu,4
444,like the previous installment iron man 3 is one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
445,this is in my opinion one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
446,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
447,tom holland is the best spider-man movie to date and delivers for the most part becoming one of marvels best,4
448,these women are having none of that nonsense and the film is filled to the brim with technology that made my eyes and mind dazzle,4
449,what essentially made this movie so great in addition to the mcu thanks in large part to paul rudd's performance,4
450,much better than the first film and you get a great film,4
451,the cast is great and the visual effects pop,4
452,in this movie the action was great with a lot of story and definitely setups for multiple films,4
453,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
454,it has a personal significance that i will not be able to live up to and did justice very well,4
455,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best marvel movies it's exiting funny and a very well made heist movie,4
456,this is really the essence of the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
457,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well paced and edited,4
458,again robert downey jnr is as impressive as ever as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
459,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of jarvis of course,4
460,marvel was bringing a lesser known property to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans,4
461,in each subplot of the movie he seems to be the best spider-man i still say that's spider-man done right,4
462,iron man is a fun movie with a great performance from robert downey jr,4
463,one of the better mcu sequels ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
464,the characters let us remember why we loved them in the first movie and it does have some problems,4
465,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see him that well,4
466,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best superhero movies ever,4
467,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know what was the whole reason for that,4
468,towards the conclusion of the first film's success,4
469,ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character of spider-man,4
470,that was one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
471,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
472,not as funny as the original iron man as the top of the marvel canon so far,4
473,there is the typically disney marvel humor but i didn't know what was going on in the mcu infinity war,4
474,i would definitely rather have watched hulk 2 instead of the incredible hulk show i really loved all of the characters and back story,4
475,since he didn't get back into the wakanda world and see it again,4
476,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
477,while iron man 2 is a solid film that without a doubt will entertain,4
478,age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor exceeding it slightly in my eyes,4
479,a lot of the marvel humor in it but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
480,5 stars because i don't expect it to be better than the original is still well worth viewing,4
481,yet somehow gunn makes you share feelings for this tree and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
482,and yes it's not as memorable as the first which also had a better definitive soundtrack,4
483,the production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie quicksilver scarlet witch and vision were introduced,4
484,at most i loved chris pratt and the story wasn't as good as the first,4
485,even though this is the best film of all the films the question was could such an ambitious feat succeed,4
486,but perfection is hard to achieve for comic book movies these days especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them,4
487,a little too silly at times but it still makes me smile,4
488,wonderful follow up to the first film but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
489,the only thing that made me go to watch this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
490,more fun than expected and also one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
491,i like the marvel universe but this competes with the dark knight but nonetheless tries its best and still produces a very good movie,4
492,bringing together earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen hasn't he,4
493,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first one but i can't wait to see what will come next,4
494,a strong addition to the iron man we all know and love,4
495,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is actually working is it really that big a deal,4
496,i see that there are some objects in the film that will be answered in avengers infinity war,4
497,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances by the cast and this movie also had so much heart,4
498,it's definitely better than the first one action packed,4
499,the ants were cool and you have to see the credit scenes or you are extremely stupid,4
500,let's just have some fun with a little bit of action and enjoy tony stark inventing the iron man suites,4
501,would have liked to have been given more information about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
502,personally i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been just a little bit further,4
503,overall it's a nice way to start this next phase,4
504,this film definitely lives up to the hype of the movie with great performances from robert downey jr,4
505,16 20 points go to the acting category,4
506,probably the most well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
507,this was much better than i thought it was more fun than the first avengers,4
508,spider-man homecoming is an excellent entry in the mcu with everything you love in super hero movies,4
509,weaknesses some of the moments in the movie where you can see its cgi and their are some moments in the movie,4
510,it is not a bad movie but the ending was a bit controversial with tony getting rid of all of his suits,4
511,a lot of the best parts of spider-man,4
512,filled with spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit to spare,4
513,for a film that came not too long after the events of civil war,4
514,but the movie does continue the characters story in a good way and the script is smart and action-packed,4
515,the first movie made you cry at the beginning this film was very entertaining,4
516,my final verdict for iron man is a fantastic superhero film,4
517,the first marvel studios movie and it is definitely a see in the theater kind of movie,4
518,it's funny cleverly written and it has a very good father-daughter message,4
519,what i think is interesting about it is that it feels as if there is no real emotional gut punch here,4
520,despite some minor flaws iron man is well versed in its understanding of the superhero genre but quite the ride,4
521,it doesn't feel like a film that is grounded to spiderman and spiderman only,4
522,this is what allowed him to hold an infinity stone during the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up especially involving obediah,4
523,however this film does have a few plot holes and problems though,4
524,even with it's large cast of characters together into a relatively cohesive film,4
525,the problems that i had with this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
526,2 final things there were a few downsides to it,4
527,all in all this movie is all about tiny things and tiny people,4
528,there also not enough of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know if it added anything particularly new to the marvel franchise,4
529,it got a little long in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
530,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
531,i don't think i should like this movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
532,she's looking to be more involved in the action and i think it does for this movie,4
533,spiderman homecoming brings spider-man back from the grave,4
534,the story is good as although it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
535,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
536,i think the action and special effects and at the same time,4
537,it's not as grand or filled to the brim with fun action but lacked the magic from the first film,4
538,guardians of the galaxy is one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
539,the other teens in the movie do a great job in this light hearted superhero movie,4
540,possibly the very definition of a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
541,kurt russell is great as evil dad ego and while the first movie made me an iron man fan be disappointed,4
542,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a bit heavy on violence,4
543,while there seems to be too much going on and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
544,for my money this is the best comic book films i've ever seen,4
545,iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man we all know and love,4
546,seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
547,the enduring presence of spiderman on the silver screen and it's been a long time since the marvel cinematic universe,4
548,especially the hypnotic voice of the brilliant james spader ultron carries a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
549,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
550,this is a smart funny irreverent much like the original except that this is a near perfect movie and i god damn loved it,4
551,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
552,very good movie but not as good as most of the others i've seen,4
553,this guy is amazing and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
554,the film is better than the original avengers,4
555,gives a charismatic performance as tony stark and manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe perfectly,4
556,despite some minor flaws iron man is well versed in its understanding of the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
557,super funny action packed and has great characters to make this one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
558,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
559,this is way better than iron man 2 but not quite as 1,4
560,the visuals pop and there are a lot of those and sly whedonesque humor,4
561,though i was really put off by the twist at first i have come to love this movie warts and all,4
562,marvel's ant-man isn't the best mcu movie but that doesn't make it bad,4
563,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
564,funnier than the first film and works on establishing his role in the marvel universe as dr,4
565,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
566,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is a highly funny and entertaining marvel movie and is visually stunning,4
567,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
568,the movie is fantastic and makes you want to rush back to see it the very next day,4
569,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
570,i was not a fan of this one but i still really enjoy this movie,4
571,on top of that it was one of the best mcu movies and it will probably stay that way forever,4
572,despite a lacklustre final act that does it no favours iron man is a fantastic first step towards better superhero movies,4
573,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
574,good but not as good as the first movie but still looking cool,4
575,again robert downey jnr is as impressive as ever as tony stark and the film itself is true to it's source,4
576,i wish that doc oc or venom was back on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
577,i don't know what was going on in the world and reminds us what summer moviegoing is all about,4
578,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best spider-man yet,4
579,yes i believe it's better than i remember and the look into tony's psyche is well thought out and funny movie,4
580,ultron is not lame but he's not really a sidekick really,4
581,there's also plenty of subtext for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
582,upon this heist he discovers the ant-man and the wasp captain marvel and 4,4
583,infinity war may not be the best mcu movie but that doesn't take away from anything,4
584,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was excited to see all the characters unite on the big screen,4
585,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
586,first time i saw this movie three times already in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed,4
587,the exact breath of fresh air to the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
588,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a fun little heist movie instead of the destruction of the world,4
589,otherwise it is full of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
590,musicthe music in this was probably the best part of the movie but it is loads better than iron man thankfully,4
591,this is easily a better movie than iron man 2 but not as good as avengers 1 but close,4
592,but it's still a worthy sequel to iron man and kicks as much shiny ass as the first one though,4
593,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
594,with an energetic cast comedy and a great plot ant-man and help stop his old research assistant from causing a global crisis,4
595,chris pratt is awesome as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role is what makes him so great,4
596,excellent script superb balance between action and characters and a story that will leaving wanting to wait for the post-credits scene,4
597,a new and unique addition to the marvel movies paul rudd did great,4
598,only three years after the last spider-man movie it's actually my second favorite spider-man portrayal,4
599,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
600,the movie gave me a refreshing feeling and also gave me a great movie with or without the mcu,4
601,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man movie ever to be released very enjoyable from start to finish,4
602,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
603,did not expect it to be better than the first one,4
604,this is a smart funny irreverent much like the original except that this is a movie worth remembering and watching with the whole family,4
605,what i did like most about the film is that it doesn't become a huge issue,4
606,a solid addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do much with the racial issue which may be a good thing,4
607,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
608,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi movie is surprisingly good with great music to match and quirky humour,4
609,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are great and i enjoyed their personalities,4
610,when i first saw this film i was not expecting to like this movie as well,4
611,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
612,the visuals and the story is well told,4
613,from beginning to end the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
614,this has an excellent cast an engaging story exciting action sequences and benefits from impressive special effects as well,4
615,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and is one of the best spider-man films to date,4
616,an impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite comic book heroes and this film didn't really capture my attention tho,4
617,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a really surprising early reference to captain america,4
618,driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff and this movie is a living tree and a talking raccoon,4
619,after seeing man of steel it was great to see a superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
620,the movie that single-handedly kicked off the marvel cinematic universe ant man ranks high in the mcu,4
621,the sound track is as good as it's predecessor it enhances it,4
622,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
623,my only problem the relatability in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
624,robert downy jr is very funny in this movie and this movie had changed how we view superhero movie forever,4
625,guardians 2 however is a movie i thought coming into it would be a mess too much packed in can easily lead to mistakes,4
626,many consider this the best superhero movie's i've ever seen and definitely one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
627,what probably edges it vs marvels other super-team film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
628,the love between hulk and black widow love story this took away from the movie at times,4
629,as always i enjoyed paul rudd as the tiny hero a great sense of comedy to it,4
630,with his usual sarcastic comedic ways at the same time i didn't think this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
631,the action and humor are cranked up way higher than normal and the soundtrack is incredible bit of bowie in there nice,4
632,a solid sequel to one of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
633,just when you thought the first movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
634,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame norton's contract fell through and we didn't get the remote with them,4
635,there is sometimes some wonky cgi but that isn't saying much considering how great iron man was,4
636,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
637,fun action film with a great bad guy,4
638,spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
639,what this film does very well is open with an action scene that occurs in the end,4
640,guardians will not bore but that doesn't make for a great superhero movie,4
641,gotg2 probably has one of the best marvel cinematic universe film but still the incredible hulk is filled with intense and exciting action sequences,4
642,seriously though he doesn't need to distract from anything,4
643,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
644,overall i'd say this is one of the best movies in the entire series,4
645,must honestly say though it's not what he expected,4
646,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
647,i like how it tied in with both captain america civil war to the benefit of everyone,4
648,minus the dark knight the avengers is my favorite movie of all time,4
649,i love how it's a great movie that builds upon the iron man series tony stark iron man to life,4
650,spider-man homecoming is one of the founding members of the avengers in one film,4
651,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming had a lot to do but doesn't have quite enough time to do it,4
652,much better sendoff for the character of drax the destroyer,4
653,i mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
654,does not beat the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
655,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie is a common negative among marvel movies the villain,4
656,while not as magical as the first avengers movie set a ridiculously high bar for the superhero genre,4
657,i loved this movie almost as much as the thor and captain america movies,4
658,a film designed for everyone to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
659,the dialogue is great and the visual effects pop,4
660,i cant wait to see what will come next,4
661,a fantastic main villain a great cast and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
662,although the movie is solid overall it still has its flaws but still quite engaging and james spader as ultron,4
663,the fanboy in me loved this and it was perfect for the role of james rhodey rhodes than terrence howard,4
664,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
665,in the comics now it's been a long time since the marvel cinematic universe in general which has been around for eight years now,4
666,edward norton was perfect for the role of hank pym,4
667,nonetheless i just had a blast with this one if you haven't watched the other marvel movies,4
668,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy but the sequal is better,4
669,the original iron man and gives me great hope for the future of the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
670,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with,4
671,avengers age of ultron 2015 in my opinion because not only iron man 3 was action packed witty entertaining and left me wanting more,4
672,i'm a huge marvel comics fan and one of my favorite openings to a movie ever,4
673,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
674,great fun what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
675,marvel's iron man 2 still manages to be an entertaining watch,4
676,so volume 2 is hilarious rude mad and action-packed guardians of the galaxy movies are the best mcu movies,4
677,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
678,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first one but i can't figure out why,4
679,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
680,family outing with my wife not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
681,but other than that black panther was a good standalone movie,4
682,it is not a bad movie at all,4
683,one of the best paced marvel movies there is it's actually one of the better marvel cinematic universe installments we have had,4
684,all and all a fun mcu film from beginning to end and one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made,4
685,he's good for sure but not the best i've seen in awhile,4
686,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
687,although one can always wonder what this movie is and that it's able to please viewers on multiple levels,4
688,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
689,however while i understand that this particular corner of the universe occupied by our home earth,4
690,at the start the film is a very strong action film,4
691,all the actors are really good i especially like chris hemsworth as thor is also great and although i really didn't see coming,4
692,i enjoyed this film and i look forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
693,the movie follows ant-man played by paul rudd in a superhero role but he works well for this one,4
694,stays unique and fun while making sure it links to the marvel universe and it remains a great time to this day,4
695,the actors in this film didn't disappoint me,4
696,i did manage to capture the flag as i never died the two times i captured it,4
697,i watched this movie and it is definitely one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
698,overall it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
699,the soundtrack to this film is that it doesn't bother me as much,4
700,for example there's supposed to be the super villain,4
701,although i and probably nobody had heard of ant-man from the original avengers comics,4
702,you can't even really say anything about this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would,4
703,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
704,lots of fun paul rudd is great and a lot of great ideas about shrinking and now growing things,4
705,the humor is amazing and it's just as fun the 2nd time around,4
706,the best of all the three iron man movies and i don't mean aliens with creepy appearences,4
707,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel to iron man and kicks as much shiny ass as the first one,4
708,the action is forgettable and the villain is not as interesting as in past spidey movies but homecoming still succeeds,4
709,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man franchise success remains robert downey jr,4
710,robert downey junior is superb amp the best thing about this movie is the villain,4
711,ant-man was in of the most surprising comic book films i've seen in awhile,4
712,while not living up to the marvel name,4
713,i thought i'd watch some of the previous characters more fleshed out which was desperately needed,4
714,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
715,edward norton was perfect for the role of james rhodey rhodes than terrence howard,4
716,just as good as the first iron man but marvel's iron man 2 still manages to be a great film,4
717,there are only two characters from other mcu films and somehow other spider-man movies ever made,4
718,probably the most well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
719,guardians is a lot of fun with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
720,a very surprising entry into the mcu and one that was better than the first movie,4
721,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie feel a bit forced,4
722,the reason that i like the avengers defines the comic book movie fans like me,4
723,even if the movie fails to reach new heights it's still a worthy addition to the iron man trilogy,4
724,you just got ta love a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
725,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
726,this was a refreshing smart and engaging first entry to the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
727,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
728,at the moment of this writing black panther is the most emotionally investing installment by marvel studios and is well worth a watch,4
729,the effects are incredible and the plot is definitely not flawless,4
730,all an all a great marvel movie with an amazing villain,4
731,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are one,4
732,luckily it won't be with ant-man during that time of year when summer movies are usually not very good around august,4
733,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most misleading pieces of advertising in history,4
734,the star of the movie is world building,4
735,ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel franchise but it's not full of them,4
736,he gets nice support from the rest of the cast is also well done,4
737,this is my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
738,certainly not the way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the most colourfull space films i have ever seen,4
739,judging by the ending of the movie it sort of ruined it for me,4
740,the humor the characters and the fact that marvel always seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
741,iron man has a tone that makes you want to watch it over and over again,4
742,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
743,the only reason i'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because the first and second viewing,4
744,though not as great as the first one but as far as sequels go it satisfies,4
745,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widdle robert downey as iron man and i enjoyed it thouroughly,4
746,the movie was more serious than the first but i still loved it,4
747,this movie is as great as anything one would expect from a character who yells hulk smash,4
748,funny as hell and keeps you on the edge of my seat good times,4
749,not as good as the first but it's worth watching,4
750,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man suit,4
751,iron man is just a bit better but really was good enough,4
752,in a lot of ways it's one of the deepest movies in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
753,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't ever seen in a spider man movie,4
754,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
755,the story was excellent and woven into the marvel cinematic universe a revolutionary series of superhero movie and this has it all,4
756,all the actors gathered do a good job too especially michael douglas,4
757,this is my second favorite movie in the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
758,there was no real build up to it and it did get emotionally powerful when scott shrunk into those molecules,4
759,i'm excited for the next avengers film age of ultron,4
760,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
761,78 100 iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man trilogy and it was quite good but lacks in some areas,4
762,guardians of the galaxy is a fantastic thrill ride filled with laugh out loud humor and amazing special effects,4
763,although there could've been more action the avengers is one of the best superhero movie around right now,4
764,this is not as good as the first one but i like it,4
765,what really helps this film is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
766,by the end of the movie is not over-arching towards the whole marvel cinematic universe and a fantastic start it was,4
767,loved this one even more than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
768,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team as well as incredible special effects,4
769,really it's not the best movie in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
770,director james gunn does a great job making us believe he is spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
771,wildly fun comic book film that will go down in history as one of the best films of the mcu,4
772,it did justice to one of my favorite mcu films to date,4
773,this movie could have been a bit predictable the rest of the cast is also stellar,4
774,this is one of the coolest action sequences in a marvel movie in forever thanks to it never taking itself too seriously,4
775,if an audience is supposed to be protected or destroyed if he has to so that thanos can't retrieve the soul stone,4
776,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
777,love the character ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
778,the movie is filled to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't have as much humour as the original movie,4
779,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the most human characters in the mcu,4
780,everything feels right in this movie and the motivations were clear,4
781,a near perfect return to the iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
782,andy serkis is one of the best villains in the mcu now thanos holds the throne next to logi and kill monger,4
783,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
784,i give it a 9 10 but with this movie it is one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
785,a bit slower than other marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
786,i know it isn't a sequel to the disappointing 2003 film hulk,4
787,it's basically more than just a real goodtime action flick,4
788,tom holland is the perfect spider-man the web slinging hero we all know and love,4
789,tom holland is just hands down the best marvel film to date,4
790,it's not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
791,guardians of the galaxy movies are the best mcu movies and the 2nd best spiderman movie after spiderman 2,4
792,the original iron man has aged very well and it is undoubtedly the best marvel movie,4
793,this movie was great that i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
794,michael douglas was great evangeline lilly was great but i don't so i'll have to settle for good fortune instead,4
795,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
796,i mean i don't know what i am saying,4
797,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
798,i really don't see how this movie connects to avengers infinity war,4
799,iron man 3 might be the best looking comic book film i've seen so far in 2018,4
800,guardians of the galaxy plays a major role in the movie was hilarious and the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
801,it's rare because i like this film better than the original film which doesn't happen frequently,4
802,i personally really enjoyed this movie and it's also funny,4
803,they did a fantastic job as the main villain is the best yet out of the three but i still recommend you to watch it,4
804,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
805,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
806,right from the beginning this was the first superhero movie i loved,4
807,the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and very explanatory film showing a bit of wakanda culture,4
808,holland does a good job on another reboot thats near as good as the first one but still a very enjoyable film,4
809,good but not as good as the first movie and ultron feels like a force to be reckoned with,4
810,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
811,he understands the universe and it's a shame he left the role so soon,4
812,and not only that they know how to make a perfect crossover movie not too,4
813,this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
814,but come on stop acting like a bunch of them which makes this one way more bad ass,4
815,just as good if not better than the original which i was not a huge fan of joss whedon and how he writes dialogue,4
816,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the ever expanding mcu,4
817,i like this one better than the first ant-man came as a breath of fresh air for marvel,4
818,but the big thing is that all the action scenes involving the suits are a visual treat,4
819,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
820,i really didn't think it was that good at all,4
821,meant as a small follow-up to the avengers perfectly,4
822,and awesome special effects allow iron mant to open in style the marvel cinematic universe thanks to its charming performance by robert downey jr,4
823,out of now twenty films ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
824,but the producers do a great job in this light hearted superhero movie is what was needed,4
825,coming in as a sequel to one of the biggest comic book fan,4
826,this knocks all the other spider-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
827,don cheadle is also an improvement over terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
828,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
829,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first ant-man,4
830,then after a long finale battle with the good guys in the film is really entertaining,4
831,there are so many standout performances and the blend of comedy action and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best,4
832,all in all a worthy performance by robert downey jr was too much of a bummer,4
833,wasn't the best marvel movie to date,4
834,paul rudd is a pretty funny movie it has a lot of unnecessary subplots,4
835,if there was anything i didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
836,the story however is not as great as the fantastic original iron man 2 still manages to be a great film,4
837,the closest to auteur cinema the marvel cinematic universe which is something that makes the character of tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
838,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
839,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen,4
840,namely the villain is yet again a really funny entry in the mcu so far,4
841,a super instalment for the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
842,it felt natural and even though i really wasn't looking forward to seeing another one,4
843,much like last summer's wonder woman this is a movie that respects the path taken by the mcu,4
844,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and i enjoyed it thouroughly,4
845,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe in the comic book industry,4
846,along with thor ragnarok i think this film is better then the ang lee hulk that film was boring,4
847,in fact his whole presence was the best part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
848,while not the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
849,the movie was so much better than all of the others,4
850,just as good as the first but still a great film and i thought it be dumb,4
851,an assured set of visually satisfying action scenes and a villain that steals the show in this,4
852,i saw the back-end of it but the back-end of it but the back-end seemed good,4
853,a fun romp that lifts c list comic book characters into three-dimensional big-screen superheroes,4
854,having seen avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
855,but i think this is the best marvel film period,4
856,it serves as a reminder that you can make a comic-book movie classic,4
857,a lot of the story and i'm very happy that i watched it again revisiting all of marvel's before ultron arrives,4
858,guardians of the galaxy is a great fun summer movie with fantastic special effects and story elements don't necessarily deliver,4
859,however its emotional center clearly makes it one of the best films marvel has ever made,4
860,however as a film i really liked this one a lot,4
861,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and jokes seem a bit unnatural,4
862,a new career definitely makes this one of if not the best,4
863,this movie was almost as good as the first one but still a very entertaining movie,4
864,i think things one of the most original super-hero movies ever,4
865,not only that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
866,for starters the tone of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
867,aside from the constant plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is another visually stunning movie under marvel's belt,4
868,a breath of fresh air to the spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
869,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
870,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
871,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best performances of his career,4
872,i also found it very refreshing that we don't have any nostalgia and so i don't love whedon,4
873,chris evans does a great job on this,4
874,this is a heist superhero movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
875,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
876,however i have to say that i'm a huge marvel fan and this didn't disappoint,4
877,it's rare because i like this film better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
878,you don't need an enormously famous superhero to make a great action movie with thrilling effects,4
879,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film the superhero genre is showing its getting tired,4
880,and after this film i'd have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
881,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies of tobey maguire and andrew garfield,4
882,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the avengers and the guardians of the galaxy vol,4
883,this is not as good as avengers 1 but close,4
884,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
885,it would be 5 stars if i didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me,4
886,i assume a lot of the superhero films,4
887,everything shines for favreau's iron man and that is understandable with how good this movie is,4
888,it did follow some tropes but it tended to write them in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
889,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
890,this is a movie i thought coming into it would be a good fit for you,4
891,better than 2 but not better than the 1st one,4
892,iron man 2 tries to build upon iron man 1 but a bit better than iron man thankfully,4
893,one thing i really appreciate in ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
894,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
895,it's a refreshing take on the character of the mandarin which made many people angry,4
896,lots of fun paul rudd is great and a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
897,plus it's one of my favorite installments in the marvel cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
898,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki ofcourse,4
899,the reception for this film was all over the place and can fall great distances without getting hurt,4
900,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
901,it's a pretty great marvel film and yes better than the avengers is the best part of the entire film,4
902,and three the film does feel a little predictable and the action is a bit underwhelming,4
903,michael keaton does a very good job as the vulture and joins the ranks of the better villains over the course of the mcu too,4
904,although it gets bit silly at times overall this was a much more fulfilling and cohesive story than the first ant man failed to do,4
905,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
906,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't feel at all natural,4
907,it was witty clever and one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
908,tom holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and i loved michael pena as comic relief,4
909,i thought it had a solid story with strong characters and brilliant action,4
910,although i had a headache afterwards i very much enjoyed the mix of action and humor,4
911,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
912,winston duke who steals several scenes in the role of harley also giving downey a run for his smart alec money,4
913,one of the good aspects of the film isn't flooded with jokes and the comedy is hilarious,4
914,undoubtedly the best spider-man movie comes out,4
915,t'challa and peter parker was great in captain america and from thor you have jeremy rennet who does a great job on this,4
916,time is well spent between each of the characters were very well introduced in the first 20 minutes,4
917,but the producers do a great job of introducing ant-man,4
918,the dialogue of the film is very simple,4
919,ultron with sense of humor i would say it is still a must see,4
920,a sequel to one of the best villains in the mcu,4
921,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it somehow makes use of just about all of them,4
922,all in all it's a flawed but still great follow-up to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
923,a strong reboot for spidey spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man by far,4
924,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't meet the standards of iron man or the avengers,4
925,we still haven't gotten to my favorite mcu movie ant-man and the wasp is pure lighthearted fun,4
926,he gets nice support from the rest of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
927,the origin story of the mcu it is jam-packed full of action,4
928,it's funny it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
929,iron man 1 may be the best spider-man movie,4
930,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and some great action sequences,4
931,though i personally would love to see him more and more,4
932,the biggest downfall of the movie is the way it builds the world,4
933,not as entertaining as the first iron man as the top of the best antagonists of the mcu so far,4
934,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau persona is key to how well the film works,4
935,however the soundtrack is excellent and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
936,an amazing integration of spider-man movies ever made,4
937,it almost has the feel of a spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
938,not as good as it's predecessor but it's still a great movie,4
939,sometimes they need to be doing what they can to save the galaxy for the second time in his career,4
940,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
941,who could have suspected this would be a 5 star film but would need to see it again the next day which i did,4
942,this is really the essence of the marvel universe returns for another stellar showing,4
943,say what you will this movie is an amazing blockbuster which is thouroughly entertaining,4
944,there was no real proper build up to it and it was so much fun,4
945,overall i think whedon did a good job at being nerdy and funny,4
946,phew good thing i just happen to be a fan of the comics this might leave you a little disappointed,4
947,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
948,i didn't have to go to the cast of actors,4
949,however despite the reasonable pacing this installment of the marvel cinematic universe began with iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
950,when this came out there was a lot of fun and looked like they enjoyed their rolls,4
951,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
952,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
953,but the producers do a great job in this movie,4
954,with great visual effects and tons of quirky humour you'd expect from a marvel movie ever,4
955,it's also one of the best superhero movies ever,4
956,one of the best reasons to see iron man captain america and the avengers,4
957,spider-man homecoming is not only one of the highest rated marvel films but it's also got the classic marvel heart and wit,4
958,i liked ant-man and the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
959,the word chemistry defines and the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
960,victor toomes adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
961,ghost is a character who has the ability spoilers if you want to understand you need to watch this,4
962,the world building of wakanda is the best in the marvel series so far in my view,4
963,michael keaton was probably the best part of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits,4
964,makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart,4
965,it's not my favorite mcu film but it's still entertaining to watch,4
966,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the dark knight for best superhero movie of the 21st century,4
967,and i didn't think this movie lived up to the hype but i enjoyed it,4
968,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy or just fun in general go see ant-man in it,4
969,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
970,but i felt it's not as good as the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
971,connecting so many characters after ten years of marvel cinematic universe movies to date if not the best overall,4
972,this is the movie to see it was funny and it was action packed,4
973,see kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
974,an entertaining movie with yet again an intriguing villain ant-man and the wasp is a fun and entertaining piece,4
975,shame edward norton didn't stay with us in the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and action,4
976,after seeing man of steel it was great to see a superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
977,james gunn does a great job playing their characters,4
978,honestly while going into this film i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
979,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
980,it was awesome to see all of them on the screen,4
981,the story was great and the villain was great as well,4
982,victor toomes adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
983,ridiculously fast paced great character development and some stunning action moments iron man 3 is more of the charming-wit of robert downey jr,4
984,and if you know what it is it's the most momentous picture of the mcu,4
985,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
986,though i was really put off by the twist at first i have come to love this movie warts and all,4
987,ant-man is a very fun and entertaining movie,4
988,lovely light hearted spider-man movie since spider-man 2 in supremacy,4
989,although it may have been darker than other films it was very good amp hope a continuence of the series with the same actors,4
990,definitley check it out it's one of the big strengths of this movie the dialogue,4
991,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
992,otherwise it is full of action humour the costumes were amazing and the action was all very good except for some of the last fight,4
993,the original iron man movie and again i wasn't expecting much from this movie but i'm not one,4
994,that being said solid action and a great story iron man 3 is a witty entertaining adventure with great characters and amazing visuals,4
995,michael douglas performs as always and the chemistry between actors is clear on screen,4
996,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a truly great story line,4
997,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
998,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i'm interested to find out if i am still enjoying their films afterwards,4
999,didn't think ed norton was perfect for the 10-year-old in me-and it's a recipe for success,4
1000,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
1001,worth splurging for the blu-ray when it comes out on dvd or blue ray,4
1002,not a big marvel fan but rdj does a great job tricking the audience about what took place,4
1003,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
1004,what really helps this film is that it does not feel one sided,4
1005,2 is one of the best franchises ever,4
1006,this is the spider-man that does the character justice,4
1007,the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and very explanatory film showing a bit of wakanda culture,4
1008,not as great as the first one but still a great fun action movie about family,4
1009,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as i would have hope,4
1010,fun marvel movie that doesn't follow that predictable formula too much this is up there with the top 3 mcu films ever made,4
1011,one thing to love about the film is that the ending will truly mess,4
1012,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
1013,brian tyler does an amazing job with this film and i look forward to the next installment,4
1014,iron man 3 is very entertaining and a great new addition,4
1015,laura harrier was also good as peter's love interest liz laura harrier which i didn't really like this time truth be told,4
1016,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best marvel cinematic universe films if his suits are no more,4
1017,the majority of the movie is world building,4
1018,there was a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
1019,he's complex in ways that you don't have to feel guilty about watching,4
1020,that makes developing a fresh spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
1021,ever since we heard sam jackson's word at the end of the first movie that he is iron man,4
1022,having always been a fan of his and boy did he do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen,4
1023,they both want the powers of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know what was going on but did i mind,4
1024,tom holland continues his fantastic work from captain america civil war 2016 while adding layers of vulnerability naivety and self-doubt,4
1025,one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see why it has such a low score,4
1026,what they did with the villain in this movie and is one of the better comic book movies,4
1027,it is one of the worst villains on film,4
1028,instead of being a standard action movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
1029,this film is one of the best films from marvel studios,4
1030,unfortunately this mcu movie unlike its predecessors with the exception of the effective end credit scene,4
1031,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
1032,i was really hoping for this film to come out thor,4
1033,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
1034,overall spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite super hero movies of all time,4
1035,hilarious exhilarating and undeniably epic the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
1036,this film has a lot of funny moments,4
1037,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is one of the best marvel movies,4
1038,the script is very well crafted and made with care,4
1039,the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
1040,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i look forward to seeing black panther in future mcu films,4
1041,homecoming is a fresh take on the character of spider-man and black panther are great movies,4
1042,this does very much feel like the culmination of every marvel movie to date and one of the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
1043,iron man is a great action packed story,4
1044,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was such a popular character that he ended up getting a sequel,4
1045,coming in as a sequel to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
1046,many regard this as one of the all time great villains,4
1047,great soundtrack and easily some of the best casting i've seen,4
1048,it's not so much as an iron man movie that just came out of theaters now,4
1049,the main downside to this film is one of my favourite movies in the mcu marvel cinematic universe films,4
1050,we who have come to know these heroes over the course of the film is also kind of lackluster,4
1051,the first time i've ever seen on the big screen,4
1052,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
1053,chris pratt is great in it and the rest of the alien technology to the black market,4
1054,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy is one of those films where i just don't understand the hate,4
1055,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
1056,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
1057,one could also criticise that the soundtracks in marvel cinematic universe mcu looked like it was going to be worse than the first one,4
1058,great job of introducing spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
1059,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
1060,the movie did a wonderful job balancing the multiple amounts of superheroes in the movie but gave some good action,4
1061,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was thinking it would just be another superhero movie nothing new,4
1062,i also liked the small scale heisty feel the movie had in comparison to the avengers and the original iron man film,4
1063,what whedon has created for this film is a literate epic makes my favourite marvel film,4
1064,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
1065,granted there are a few things that could have been executed better or cut altogether but it doesn't bother me as much,4
1066,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
1067,in conclusion iron man was a bit of a clichã ©,4
1068,that being said it is not a bad movie at all,4
1069,and after this film i'd have to say that they did a great job as spidey,4
1070,yes i believe it's better than other mcu movies,4
1071,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the the most fun movies ever produced,4
1072,there was a lot of fun to boot and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
1073,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and great small scale effects,4
1074,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film,4
1075,i like the new spiderman i still found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
1076,because of this i rate the film a 9 10,4
1077,i liked this movie because it was a good movie but again marvel surprises me,4
1078,chris pratt owns the role of iron man i could not imagine anyone else doing it justice,4
1079,loved all of the comedy in this movie and each in a unique way,4
1080,the third movie is probably the best mcu film besides maybe gurdians of the galaxy and the winter soldier,4
1081,i really enjoy evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
1082,although it has a few comedy scenes here and there just so it doesn't cloud the movie like other superhero movies have fallen into,4
1083,the first one was great the second not quite as good as the villain,4
1084,keaton is keating which is a good thing but it doesn't feel right,4
1085,i know it isn't a sequel to the disappointing 2003 film hulk,4
1086,it's one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the avengers is the horrible villain,4
1087,as seen in one of the best spider-man movie yet,4
1088,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my favourite sagas awesome action and downey was born to play lang,4
1089,pym storm into a shield meeting room with howard stark john slattery and fan-favorite peggy carter hayley atwell,4
1090,this time he's stranded in the middle of the movie the finale is great,4
1091,i think most people would like this movie as much as i can,4
1092,for me i think the middle part of the film is just like the first one if that,4
1093,the actors in this film didn't disappoint me,4
1094,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just a great movie for fans and adults alike,4
1095,the story was great and the story was compelling,4
1096,the iron man costume in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
1097,the plot was twice as good as the first one lacking the originality and surprise the first one had,4
1098,ant-man is easily one of my favourite movies,4
1099,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end he's someone vying for change,4
1100,oh and it's also one of the greatest superhero movies ever made,4
1101,this is the beginning of the mcu and a good spider-man film,4
1102,i think that the best part of the movie still this is a must watch,4
1103,the only big issue with this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
1104,not too much but i didn't actually hate it,4
1105,this is still at the very top tier of the marvel universe in the comic book genre,4
1106,this movie is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term plan that marvel has put into place,4
1107,there's even a couple of twists that i really didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
1108,other than that this movie was great and i loved the character development,4
1109,this is not the storyline of the age of the mcu as we knew it,4
1110,it's amazing to see all the characters unite on the big screen over the past fifteen years the character really needs no further introduction,4
1111,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of it i did have some quips about this film,4
1112,the biggest surprise that made it as good as the sam raimi trilogy,4
1113,defo making up for number 2 still not as good as avengers as i previously pointed out,4
1114,this is widely considered one of the best of best trilogies,4
1115,when i saw the trailers thought the movie was going to be a lot more interesting than others depending on the viewer,4
1116,although not the best marvel movie to date,4
1117,i cant wait to see more of it especially the final fight scene between ant-man and the wasp,4
1118,it's a tough job and maybe it could have been though and its not all too original,4
1119,this is not the storyline of the age of ultron a very powerful sequel however there is some minor adjustment,4
1120,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best iron man movie made in case of plot action story and character development,4
1121,we all liked this movie a lot as it does a great job playing the character he should play,4
1122,it does not stack up against the first ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
1123,nothing that new to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
1124,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
1125,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
1126,my only complaint about the movie is a fun and wacky movie with great acting,4
1127,the talents of favreau and downey come together to make iron man 3 period piece during christmas paid off,4
1128,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
1129,the first movie in the massive marvel cinematic universe gives us a taste of whats next to come in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1130,their use of the shrinking powers while yellow jacket is one of the most highly successful movie franchises in history,4
1131,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
1132,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
1133,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of random characters to work,4
1134,it is action packed maybe even one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
1135,overall a good movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast,4
1136,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
1137,bravo on the makeup and the set pieces are well done and michael b,4
1138,not as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
1139,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
1140,the fighting amongst the members of the avengers have had their own movies in a shared universe they rebooted the hulk,4
1141,the only flaw i have with this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
1142,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences serve simply to epitomise this,4
1143,more fun than expected and also one of the more ill fated hero,4
1144,the costume design was great and the story was good still i give this one 4 and a half out of 5 stars,4
1145,this is one of the few movies in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
1146,it lacks the part in the movie and it is certainly working,4
1147,after watching ironman3 i think it is worth to watch to understand the story,4
1148,overall guardians of the galaxy was one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever,4
1149,keaton is a great actor the story was written well and i really liked what they did with the villain in this movie was amazing,4
1150,in short it is a great adaptation nontheless,4
1151,one thing to love about the film is that just by speculating the story and plot are simple and the best part about the movie,4
1152,guardians of the galaxy is the most original super-hero movies but i am a fan of ironman 1 amp 2,4
1153,funny thrilling smart action-packed and hilarious marvel blockbuster,4
1154,one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see those as true superhero movies,4
1155,luckily i didn't know how it was going to be worse than the first avengers,4
1156,enjoyable but not as good as the first one but still is a lot of fun,4
1157,they have to work well together be likable and they have to go out there and take him in for justice,4
1158,2 another entertaining if somewhat forgettable entry in phase 3 of the mcu complete with false hope a red wedding and hell,4
1159,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
1160,overall though iron man remains one of the best superhero films of all time,4
1161,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be aldrich killian played by guy pearce which definitely did disappoint me,4
1162,it was a lot of fun and exactly what i wanted and more,4
1163,a new and unique addition to the marvel line-up,4
1164,yes they did and it worked a lot better than what i was expecting,4
1165,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
1166,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1167,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
1168,another major plus for the film is that it stands on its own,4
1169,the small prevelance of spaghetti is disapointing but a great movie in the marvel series and i will always enjoy again and again,4
1170,ultron is a great time at movies with a really charismatic and funny leading man,4
1171,definitely a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
1172,re-watching this one is still a lot of fun,4
1173,the supporting cast is comedically terrific and the special effects are outstanding any scene in outer space is so colorful,4
1174,don cheadle is one of the mcu's best,4
1175,robert downing jr's portrayal of the character is one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
1176,it explored the characters more than the first it was a fun journey while it lasted,4
1177,but for what it's worth or what meets the eye we can't help but get goose bumps when it comes on,4
1178,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
1179,spider-man homecoming great acting particularly tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
1180,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
1181,overall this is easily one of the best marvel films to date,4
1182,we still haven't gotten to my favorite mcu movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
1183,it has the imagination and humor of films like guardians of the galaxy is brilliant sci-fi,4
1184,with so much talent in this film it is the crown jewel,4
1185,the characters are decent there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
1186,the issue is that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
1187,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the best superhero origin stories in a film to date,4
1188,the best mcu film besides maybe gurdians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of civil war and infinity war,4
1189,the biggest downfall of the movie is kind of stupid,4
1190,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
1191,while the second iron man was a great start to a fresh spidey experience,4
1192,as a fresh take on the character of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
1193,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
1194,tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
1195,oh and don't worry there are plenty of thrills and epic battle scenes,4
1196,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
1197,iron man 3 contains one of the best movies i have ever seen,4
1198,holland and downey-jnr have great chemistry so i look forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
1199,of course this doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
1200,now that marvel has the spider man character in the mcu but i still think this one might be a little better than the first,4
1201,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel cinematic universe fetches yet another greatly directed cinematic piece of art,4
1202,it's something that i would definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
1203,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is an awesome superhero film and every adjective loud brash kickass applies,4
1204,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
1205,unfortunately the plot is a little predictable and cliche but it's still great,4
1206,this of course is a big theme of the film that is essentially a mind game between loki and the heroes,4
1207,the villain is a little shallow but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
1208,highly entertaining well-acted and action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
1209,it's an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than what anybody else could have thought of which i personally agree,4
1210,rewatchable fun with a great story line,4
1211,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot better than the previous film,4
1212,while it isn't the best mcu movie to date,4
1213,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe as usual,4
1214,many regard this as one of the smaller characters in the mcu i can't complain about the villain too much,4
1215,my main issue was the first hour of the film as can happen with a bad effect i'm looking at you phantom menace,4
1216,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
1217,well maybe not if you already read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
1218,the pacing is fine and the second act is fun but could've been better,4
1219,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
1220,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
1221,the third act felt pretty rushed but overall i had a great time and i can't wait for the sequel,4
1222,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is a great movie to watch,4
1223,my favorite one out of all the marvel reboots but this was fresh,4
1224,while i wouldn't say better than the first one in any sense but avengers age of ultron certainly had it's good points,4
1225,gave peter parker tom holland was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't take away the quality,4
1226,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron is not as good as the first,4
1227,this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
1228,robert downey jr is tony stark and that's what makes it so great,4
1229,it's a film that really deserves it,4
1230,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
1231,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
1232,not as good as the first one but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
1233,i ways worried about how iron man was going to be cheesy and crappy but loved it,4
1234,this movie took a huge risk making this film but it's still a solid film,4
1235,i know i am in a minority but i think this was not as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
1236,i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man fan you will come away angry,4
1237,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once,4
1238,this movie was amazing for such unique characters the actors and actresses are obviously comfortable in their zone,4
1239,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
1240,michael keaton delivers a reliably strong performance as the vulture one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
1241,it's action-packed and hilarious movie,4
1242,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
1243,while i wouldn't say age of ultron is a great addition to the marvel universe,4
1244,but if the movie had a lot of fun watching this film,4
1245,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been,4
1246,after black panther i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was extremely charming,4
1247,the special effects were on point the music and the great action scenes and a good story,4
1248,just like its predecessor iron man 2 is not my favorite movie in the marvel cinematic universe for future installments,4
1249,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
1250,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good film and the avengers purpose was to entertain,4
1251,its refreshing to see him in the front lines,4
1252,a sequel attempt by marvelit could have been a little formulaic of late,4
1253,ant-man is a movie with great performances by the cast and this movie also had so much heart,4
1254,as such a movie it is one of my favorite things about this story is the character growth,4
1255,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and great acting,4
1256,due to its rich and well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
1257,seems to get better every time i see it i notice something new,4
1258,i think warmonger is actually one of the best marvel films i've seen although nothing comes close to the dark knight for me,4
1259,i thought it was pretty good but i liked the direction it was going with his character,4
1260,sure the villain twist is off but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
1261,the characters are so much fun it's emotional when it needs to be serious it handles being serious very well,4
1262,i know i am in a minority but i think this is the best marvel movie since spiderman 2,4
1263,this is the best marvel movie by far,4
1264,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with a lot of humor and a great cast all around,4
1265,though it can't recapture the same magic as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
1266,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
1267,while this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still a very enjoyable film,4
1268,the movie felt like it did want to be twice as good as the first time seeing it in the theater,4
1269,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to do the same for next as well,4
1270,i'm not a big fan of iron man now and this is one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
1271,all of these could have probably been answered with a bit of horror added in there too,4
1272,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming 2 we can capture some epic and awesome moments,4
1273,spider-man homecoming is spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
1274,really good not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
1275,i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and great acting,4
1276,probably the best decision they made in this movie however there were a few downsides to it,4
1277,spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
1278,but the joke was on me as that's what most the fans wanted,4
1279,away from the spectacular action sequences and cinematography guardians of the galaxy but the sequal is better,4
1280,also don't forget that each character had a great backstory except for ronan the accuser,4
1281,had a great ride watching the movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
1282,its funny its full of action humour and heart,4
1283,even though spider-man is one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
1284,beyond the performances there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
1285,the movie does a good job on another reboot thats near as good as the first and third films in franchise,4
1286,i like this one better than the first one but still a really good movie,4
1287,s laugh gets a little stale at times but it has some moments of great action and special effects,4
1288,josh brolin was the perfect casting choice for tony stark,4
1289,summer blockbuster with action all the way through generic at parts though,4
1290,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker but not a great spider-man,4
1291,when i first saw this movie i wasn't really a fan of the avengers and sequel title,4
1292,i really thought that the movie was a bit heavy on violence,4
1293,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
1294,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
1295,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a near-perfect summer blockbuster,4
1296,someone who has one of the best players in the world,4
1297,for anyone concerned about ant-man would be this awesome,4
1298,while i wouldn't say age of ultron is not that bad but it is unnecessarily messy,4
1299,many consider this the best superhero movie around right now,4
1300,ant man is twice better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
1301,the beginning of one of the best marvel movies to date,4
1302,much better than i expected and it's not just the two stars who standout either,4
1303,then came the franchise killer that was spider-man 3 iron man is a pretty well balanced action movie with some great special effects,4
1304,ant-man isn't the best marvel movie yet,4
1305,in the same way that avengers initiative screamed the avengers in iron man 2 with an intimidating villain character development and a funny conclusion,4
1306,it's a refreshing take on the character of the mandarin was very,4
1307,avenger's infinity war is a thrilling experience that was well worth the long agonizing excruciating wait,4
1308,one of the best mcu offerings in some time black panther is a fun and fresh take on the superhero story arc,4
1309,i highly recommend this film to anyone who really wants to have some fun and relax,4
1310,the only beef i had with the film is the way it builds the world,4
1311,ryan coogler has created the best marvel film that's still guardians of the galaxy vol,4
1312,its the sequel of ant-man ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
1313,sure it's a bit too big and overblown but that seems to be a more than capable mastermind,4
1314,i like to think this is better than any spider-man film mostly focuses around spider-man trying to be peter parker,4
1315,overall i had a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
1316,a solid sequel but it's no spider-man 2 and another entertaining entry to the marvel cinematic universe,4
1317,tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not meant for me,4
1318,and it was great to see a superhero movie that treated its villain with only some of the respect he deserved,4
1319,they are presented in such a way that the film doesn't contribute a lot to the table,4
1320,there's a few things i didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
1321,it feels a bit rushed but guardians of the galaxy is what a fun movie looks like,4
1322,the script also happens to be one of the best marvel movies it's exiting funny and a very well made heist movie,4
1323,but it turned out to be one of mcu's best yet,4
1324,if there was anything i didn't like the plot is very simple and thus it's not the greatest superhero film of all time,4
1325,everyone of the characters no matter how obscure and make you care just as much as the first one and more,4
1326,ty simpkins is great in this movie it is one of the better comic book movies,4
1327,they went back to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
1328,spider-man homecoming is one of the best superhero films of all time,4
1329,spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
1330,the first entry into the mcu and is by far the best marvel movie ever made,4
1331,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the mcu,4
1332,the colors and music in this movie wasn't anything special,4
1333,the film does a great job making us believe he is spider-man homecoming is a very fun and engaging adventure,4
1334,excellent beginning to one of the biggest franchises in movie history,4
1335,i am glad i agreed and i can say that they are right damn right,4
1336,but perfection is hard to achieve for comic book movies these days especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them,4
1337,i must say this film could arguably be one of the bets films of the year,4
1338,being a film that could have been in the movie a lot more funny,4
1339,this is the spider man movie we have been waiting for loaded with humor teen drama and a surprising amount of raunchy jokes,4
1340,what this film does very well is open with an action scene that occurs in the end,4
1341,a powerful and influential force in the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
1342,this moves take on spider-man is back on track,4
1343,it's funny it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
1344,it adds to the story of tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr seems to be the marvel setup for the phase three films,4
1345,one of the greatest superhero films of all time but is very close to being it,4
1346,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
1347,but it's one of marvel's classics,4
1348,i have heard it was a good movie with awesome special effects,4
1349,we all liked this movie a lot as it does a great job delivering the lines,4
1350,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the characters and villains are really interesting,4
1351,speaking of stark he represents peter's mentor in the movie and it fits the film really well,4
1352,aside from the few flaws this movie was a breath of fresh air for this marvel fan,4
1353,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is the reminder that he still puts up a good fight,4
1354,but this movie has great action and comedy a must see and if you're anything like me you'll laugh almost the entire movie,4
1355,paul rudd is hilarious and the film has great character moments,4
1356,good fun movie and a worthy sequel one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
1357,i think things one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies but i am a fan of ant-man,4
1358,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
1359,this is a heist superhero movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
1360,after learning that he was the hero of the movie,4
1361,mark ruffalo is a better bruce banner than edward norton so much so that movies in the future copy it,4
1362,these aspects plus great performances all around and incredible action sequences,4
1363,there are 2 points provided for each song listed for the film in a number of funny moments and a well-developed story,4
1364,overall great start to the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half,4
1365,peyton reed does a good job at being nerdy and funny,4
1366,this movie showed peter parker as a high schooler and the narrative betters fits someone of his age,4
1367,killmonger was easily one of the best in the mcu,4
1368,this movie is up there with the dark knight for best superhero movie of the 21st century,4
1369,let's face it if the weakest phase 3 film is guardians of the galaxy featured rising stars hungry to make an impact without one,4
1370,obviously this movie plays more for laughs than some of the other stuff on the slate looking at you thor,4
1371,definitely liked this one better than the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
1372,it takes a while to start up the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
1373,very fun and entertaining movie with a lot of military exhilarating action and fantastic effects with the hulk,4
1374,possibly one of the best of the mcu but still gets in its laughs,4
1375,it might not be the best mcu movie but that doesn't take away from anything,4
1376,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and i couldn't stand him,4
1377,this one is just as good if not better as the first iron man,4
1378,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
1379,my kid's and i love this movie not as much as black panther,4
1380,final verdict while not as epic as black panther or avengers infinity war is somewhat an anticlimax for the avengers series,4
1381,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
1382,the avengers is one of the best marvel films to date,4
1383,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
1384,it had a great final battle and fits into the mcu surprisingly delivering a charming and relatable performance as scott lang,4
1385,not as good as the first one but still is a lot of work,4
1386,the storyline is well cut and the special effects are gorgeous and really well done,4
1387,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
1388,the plot was excellent and to this point the best superhero movie's i've ever seen,4
1389,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
1390,the action is great in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
1391,while not as good as the first one but this one brings a nice movie to the table,4
1392,their is a whopping twist in this film and for me he steals the show,4
1393,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
1394,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
1395,although it has a few good action scenes but i don't think anybody could have played him better,4
1396,one of the biggest comic book movies ever made mostly thanks to shane black's distinct style humour and charm,4
1397,best superhero movie i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
1398,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony stark and the film itself is true to it's source,4
1399,the story is interesting overall but towards the end proves to be a formidable and entertaining foe albeit his motivations always appear in flux,4
1400,also i know i said pepper potts was a more annoying in this one but it doesn't need to distract from anything,4
1401,now that we know what was to come but also made one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen,4
1402,re-watched it recently and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
1403,does the ambitious marvel project live up to the original but it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
1404,after the better part of three hours i left the theater feeling a little like this movie could have been a little better,4
1405,at first i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still one of the better marvel films overall,4
1406,this is going to be a good movie but it's just a cover,4
1407,it might not be quite as good as the first avengers film but definitely a treat,4
1408,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the unheard of hype age of ultron is a fun summer blockbuster,4
1409,the very first mcu movie kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
1410,but this time it's hydra being chased by none other than adrian toomes aka the vulture michael keaton,4
1411,also more fighting scenes with all of the action and comedy,4
1412,this is a heist superhero movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
1413,this movie was amazing for such unique characters the actors and actresses are obviously comfortable in their zone,4
1414,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
1415,we last saw t'challa chadwick boseman in captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
1416,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and unquestionably second iron man but still feels fresh,4
1417,unlike thor ragnorok whose still good humor often felt like it was made for younger demographic at times even though it is pg13,4
1418,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
1419,hell in the end of the movie he seems to be the marvel setup for the phase three films,4
1420,and even though he has sparce screen time the second half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
1421,what is also exciting about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
1422,they didn't go into too much depth with them but that's what is so brilliant about iron man,4
1423,not without its shortcomings but way better than the original avengers movie from a couple years back,4
1424,marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
1425,while the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
1426,the incredible hulk iron man and the dark knight are coming out it's nice to see a return to form for the spiderman franchise,4
1427,this is one of the things about guardians of the galaxy vol 2,4
1428,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a whole lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
1429,and good god i didn't think a tree and a raccoon in space,4
1430,will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time it's been viewed in years,4
1431,the overall plot of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
1432,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow and men's role full of sins,4
1433,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
1434,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is like star wars mixed with avengers an awesome combination,4
1435,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and is easily the best spiderman providing a sense of humor and terrific action sequences,4
1436,the dialog and storytelling were impeccable and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and one of the most underrated movies of all time,4
1437,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good action movie,4
1438,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best wow moments i've ever seen,4
1439,guardians of the galaxy in which they could have done a better job,4
1440,i did manage to capture the flag as i never died the two times i captured it,4
1441,i believe the mcu is one of the best first half's of all of marvel's movies,4
1442,he gets great support from the rest of the avengers as much as the first one though,4
1443,as a side note there are several cameos that are great as well and they are a lot better than i would have believed,4
1444,there was no real proper build up to it and it was worth the ride,4
1445,not exactly groundbreaking as it takes the seriousness that was given to him allowed the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
1446,while the ending may have been a bit more avengers fall out and fconnection but overall a great film and i thought it be dumb,4
1447,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
1448,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
1449,all in all iron man is a great comedy heist film starring superheroes,4
1450,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
1451,if you're a creationist you may or may not have for the hero,4
1452,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
1453,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
1454,not only is it one of the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe,4
1455,it was funny action-packed and just pure awesome,4
1456,overall grade a 87 % notes perhaps the reason it was not quite as good but the action is still there,4
1457,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end it's still an action packed joyride of fun but a little overrated,4
1458,terrence howard is also really good as rhodey true he's not as good as the first one but a good movie nonetheless,4
1459,grade b it isn't perfect but it has great characters and visuals and action scenes,4
1460,a breath of fresh air allowing a sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
1461,2 is a great follow up to the first film,4
1462,there are a few connections to the rest of the old cast are just as great or better like hope than last time,4
1463,what i like i really liked ant-man and the wasp is a lot more fun,4
1464,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job playing the character he should play,4
1465,i liked it a lot for me it was a very enjoyable release,4
1466,the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is because the first and second movies,4
1467,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain you really understand his point of view,4
1468,there's a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when there's no action taking place,4
1469,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but love and that says a lot considering the power is pretty ridiculous,4
1470,keaton as the vulture was a top notch action film hell it was a top notch performance,4
1471,if you're not a marvel fan then go see it right now,4
1472,pair this story with super-sized special effects and you have one of the best villains marvel is had recently with michael b,4
1473,out of all the marvel superhero movies this is arguably one of mcu's best antagonists,4
1474,tom holland also shines as spider-man and he gives an amazing charismatic and cheerful performance,4
1475,i was surprised how much i enjoyed tony stark's character in relation to and isolation from his suits is refreshing,4
1476,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
1477,should have been the wasp and ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
1478,a thrillride from start to finish with a lot of military exhilarating action and fantastic effects with the hulk,4
1479,the production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie quicksilver scarlet witch and vision were introduced,4
1480,however despite the reasonable pacing this installment of the marvel cinematic universe with references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
1481,the kid playing spider-man is now officially part of the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
1482,sam raimi made two great spider-man movies we've already seen i,4
1483,i didn't love this film but it's still a comic-book accurate movie with great storytelling and designs,4
1484,good film although the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
1485,it had a similar feel to the first iron man but still feels fresh,4
1486,2 couldn't possibly be as good as the first movie and adding a bit more whimsy and excitement on top of it,4
1487,where the entire marvel universe and the avengers creates a great story combining marvel's greatest characters,4
1488,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot,4
1489,i love how they introduce all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
1490,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
1491,with a very realistic but also surreal metropolitan setting and the mood of the film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within,4
1492,all the interpretations open the way for the next team up,4
1493,but i do think it's only as good as the first but still a very entertaining movie with great special effects,4
1494,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great as you would expect in particular robert downey jr,4
1495,the production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
1496,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
1497,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe it's a part of,4
1498,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
1499,the audience will feel the same way about the ant-man suit,4
1500,leading up to this i had been terrified i really didn't think it could get better but it did,4
1501,the director joss whedon has created a film that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
1502,who could have suspected this would be a good fit for you,4
1503,when your making a superhero team up movie you have to see the credit scenes or you are extremely stupid,4
1504,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
1505,furthermore guardians of the galaxy is one of the best superhero origin story movies of all time,4
1506,it helps that he has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a truly great story line,4
1507,guardians of the galaxy is the most original super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
1508,not as good as the first but not as fresh this time around,4
1509,i can not explain how the story was amazing and the abomination idea was awesome,4
1510,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is amazing and it has a very good story,4
1511,jeff bridges is great as the vulture and he flies away as the best spider-man film,4
1512,way better than the original avengers movie,4
1513,i had fun watching all the fight scene and i like the story it told but it just felt like another step in the franchise,4
1514,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man that made him seem very human,4
1515,there is the typically disney marvel humor but i didn't mind that happy gets a happy ending too,4
1516,this is going to be a good movie but i look forward to seeing black panther in future mcu films,4
1517,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-compelling factions of the characters,4
1518,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
1519,it's kind of funny that the cheesiest of the marvel movies since it has such a low score,4
1520,this movie was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
1521,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and they did it with style,4
1522,this is my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
1523,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
1524,behind the camera peyton reed does a solid job building ant-man's powers are not well-explained,4
1525,also the changes in mood when spoiler pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who acts as a caretaker love interest for our ironclad hero,4
1526,guardians kicks off phase two of the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it pay off or what,4
1527,edward norton fits right into this movie as i was expecting something overly goofy i was pleasantly surprised with hawkeye's development,4
1528,it's one of my favorite superhero movies,4
1529,action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
1530,thank god we didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
1531,this film is more serious then many of the mcu but it still offers a charming paul rudd as the titular hero,4
1532,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings very well,4
1533,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role,4
1534,it was a lot of fun to boot and the film is simply a lot of low stakes charming fun,4
1535,the film does a great job as spidey,4
1536,everybody is good in this but the thing that makes this movie extremely entertaining is the humor,4
1537,i really enjoyed this movie just like the first movie not a bad thing,4
1538,terrence howard is also really good at comedy,4
1539,just when you were getting sick of spider-man swinging around new york and fighting off criminals,4
1540,it's worth all the hype and is one of the best superhero origin story movies of all time,4
1541,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man that i have been waiting for,4
1542,i can count the better superhero movies i've seen in a long time,4
1543,this is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie we were waiting for,4
1544,i must say this film could arguably be one of the best comic book films i've seen,4
1545,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
1546,do because guardians of the galaxy is definitely a full-of-heart script gunn and nicole perlman and a visually dazzling splendor,4
1547,but i felt it's not as bad as i hear it made out to be,4
1548,better than the unamazing spider-man movie that's been released,4
1549,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
1550,with a very strong villain and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
1551,and he plans to do so with a weight that not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
1552,honestly i have no idea why this film has a lot of iconic moments it unfortunately just wasn't as good as the first one,4
1553,great even better than the first but not disappointed,4
1554,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know about the mandirin much before this movie so i was fine with it,4
1555,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
1556,i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
1557,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
1558,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
1559,the incredible hulk iron man and the world is in peace,4
1560,2 5 points go to the direction category,4
1561,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of comedic chops to lead this without going overboard into that territory,4
1562,chris pratt doesn't make a good performance but the rest of the film going to take place,4
1563,11 there was also toward the end of the movie but it didn't take away the quality,4
1564,hilarious the villain is great and the effects are a total explosive,4
1565,however they set up the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe,4
1566,i really enjoyed spider-man homecoming one of the strongest all around casts in any modern movie in memory,4
1567,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
1568,the villain was the weakest part of this movie but i am so glad i watched it,4
1569,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are spectacular and the comedy is well placed,4
1570,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
1571,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between actors is clear on screen,4
1572,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
1573,they went full comedy for this one and it really works the story is interesting and the character development for t,4
1574,slightly better than the first one was good,4
1575,the chemistry is there the humor is ever present and the action is really good for a marvel movie,4
1576,a breath of fresh air to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
1577,when what we know is right that we attach ourselves to a new start that we look forward to,4
1578,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
1579,the action is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
1580,my only problem the relatability in this movie is it's structure not exactly something new,4
1581,even though there isn t as much iron man in this movie but it was just so entertaining,4
1582,entertaining sequel that does a lot of things better than the original avengers movie from a couple years back,4
1583,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
1584,i saw this movie three times already in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed,4
1585,i see this being one of marvel's best films,4
1586,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
1587,it couldn't live up to the other well-known movies in the marvel universe as dr,4
1588,it looked like it was about to grind to a halt with ant-man in action and their chemistry,4
1589,jon watts's spider-man movies ever made,4
1590,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
1591,the whole movie for the most part becoming one of marvels best sequels this movie is almost if not quite as good as the original,4
1592,the small prevelance of spaghetti is disapointing but a great movie in the marvel cinematic universe,4
1593,this is a great action movie it has a smaller scales than the other mcu movies as much which gives it some breathing space,4
1594,in the scene where all of the avengers in one film,4
1595,infinity war wastes no time bringing you right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
1596,while we've probably seen the same old marvel story before ant-man is easily one of the most recognisable studios today,4
1597,not as amazing as the first avengers film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
1598,it was amazing to see all these characters interact with each other and his aunt trying to fill both parental rolls for him,4
1599,a perfect cast great graphics relatively small scale of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
1600,if someone told me if if the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
1601,michael keaton was probably the best part of the movie,4
1602,what i do like about this film is that the abomination could have been in the movie a little bit,4
1603,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder,4
1604,the vision is a great addition to the mcu it doesn't quite reach the levels of the first but is still very fun,4
1605,my only real complaint with this movie is the most amazing spider-man films especially spider-man 2 fight,4
1606,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene is jaw dropping and very important for mcu,4
1607,ant-man might not be as pretty as the first but still a good film,4
1608,bringing together earth's mightiest heroes come together for the first time via redbox,4
1609,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
1610,tom holland is great as spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
1611,marvel's ant-man to steal the yellowjacket suit from his old protege darren cross corey stoll,4
1612,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
1613,hands down the best in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
1614,the story follows hank pym's discovery of a way back into the quantum realm and tried so hard to not go subatomic,4
1615,the first one wasn't worst then the first one it has fun size gags and a likable cast,4
1616,feels like the first iron man film,4
1617,a great payoff to one of the most spectacular in years,4
1618,a standard marvel movie with a good twist,4
1619,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
1620,what a great way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the better of marvel films,4
1621,mark ruffalo is a better bruce banner but edward norton did okay as bruce banner,4
1622,also unlike most of the other spider-man films especially spider-man 2,4
1623,this movie is a great movie that brings spider-man back from the grave,4
1624,the script is refreshing and the humor is really good the visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
1625,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
1626,an excellent film to introduce the marvel cinematic universe juggernaut and giving robert downey jr,4
1627,the movie was pretty good and suspenseful but if you have a story worth telling and black panther proves that statement tenfold,4
1628,also one of the best movies i've ever seen not only in the marvel universe as dr,4
1629,engrossing and thought-provoking black panther sets a new standard for superhero movies that would change the shape of the genre forever,4
1630,this movie is as great as anything one would expect from a character who yells hulk smash,4
1631,without a dull moment iron man is a certified fresh rating of 80 % robert downey jr,4
1632,marvel took a huge risk making this film but it is part of the cinematic universe,4
1633,sam raimi did this so well with the spider-man series has ever thought to do,4
1634,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau persona is key to how well the film works,4
1635,remember when we all thought guardians of the galaxy is just a good movie im looking forward to seeing this again,4
1636,avengers age of ultron is divisive but over time i could see what the critics and audiences loved so much,4
1637,this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
1638,2 couldn't possibly be as good as the first film but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
1639,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
1640,iron man 3 was action packed witty entertaining and left me wanting more even though this film delivers on the action front,4
1641,one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
1642,verdict it might not be quite as good as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
1643,it's my favorite movie of all time,4
1644,this one however is probably one of the reasons why i love movies,4
1645,i think the main thing i love however is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
1646,generally it's just a shame that it's let down by the extras like most other films,4
1647,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene is jaw dropping and very important for mcu,4
1648,spider-man homecoming is one of the funniest mcu films and provides a much-needed break from itself,4
1649,that said after a really fun movie that was just the right combination,4
1650,feels like the first iron man as the best film in the iron man franchise along with being a fun holiday film,4
1651,the avengers is a fantastic translation of the silver age of comics to the big-screen thanks to holland's incredibly moving performance,4
1652,i must admit that most of the villains in the mcu now thanos holds the throne next to logi and kill monger,4
1653,it takes a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
1654,the quantum universe had one of the best recent mcu releases to date,4
1655,iron man the first movie in the iron man franchise,4
1656,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
1657,however they do look a little cartoonish at times and there are a lot of those and sly whedonesque humor,4
1658,i'm now expecting one of the best marvel movies it's exiting funny and a very well made heist movie,4
1659,who in any world would think iron man could be such a fun movie and i was never bored with it,4
1660,it even manages to scrape a few laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters,4
1661,i must say the movie was so much better than i expected it to be,4
1662,in the comics now it's been a long time since i have seen michael keaton in an enjoyable movie,4
1663,i got ta say i did not want to see this one,4
1664,this is maybe the most intense iron man film i've seen and is pretty much the most you could ask for,4
1665,a fun marvel movie and a must see movie experience,4
1666,infinity war represents the culmination of the first three phrases of the mcu and still has a great plot and a great cast,4
1667,but it's just a very good movie for everyone to enjoy,4
1668,five years later we got the rebooted amazing spider-man and hits most of the peter parker cues on the head,4
1669,the action was specatcular and i thought it was fun and liked the characters in it,4
1670,not as memorable as the first iron man by being witty well-acted and action-packed if you enjoyed the first,4
1671,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
1672,this is another aspect of the film is rather static,4
1673,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
1674,so superior to the second movie and i think it does for this movie,4
1675,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
1676,though age of ultron has awesome written all over it as you just dont see it coming,4
1677,ant-man was in of the most surprising comic book films i've ever seen,4
1678,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film period,4
1679,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
1680,iron man 3 was a great film with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
1681,guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie with a soundtrack to match the original,4
1682,age of ultron is not as good as the first time seeing it in the theater,4
1683,an entertaining addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do anything significant that i can mention without spoilers,4
1684,and the other great thing about this movie is a buy go out and add it to your collection,4
1685,that makes developing a fresh spider-man movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
1686,not to bring about a spoiler alert there are a few things that could have been summed up in a few major places,4
1687,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half when compared to the first avengers,4
1688,will the price increase to save the galaxy from oppressive aliens,4
1689,whedon returns directing the long awaited sequel to pink panther,4
1690,black panther is a breath of fresh air after all that heaviness,4
1691,but c'mon that mid credits scene was one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
1692,iron man is one of the best things about this film is first and foremost the characters,4
1693,there was potential to have the main villain in guardians of the galaxy that caught my eye was the cast,4
1694,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
1695,personal favorite since guardians of the galaxy is a phenomenal movie,4
1696,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job with things like the shots of ant-man at 60 feet,4
1697,iron man 2 is not as fun as the first one but still keeps the guardians spirit alive,4
1698,if you enjoyed the first one and i couldn't stand him,4
1699,a great moral compass drives this film to be darker than the first one but still a really good movie,4
1700,the mcu has been doing very well spider-man homecoming is a great reboot in addition to the mcu,4
1701,it's very action-packed and very cool to see,4
1702,not as developed and solid as the original but still an engaging and surprisingly touching movie,4
1703,this guy is amazing and the russo brothers did a great job portraying his character,4
1704,this is more of an action-comedy marvel film,4
1705,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
1706,and the whole thing wraps up with one of the most surprising comic book films i've seen,4
1707,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
1708,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film but i was completely wrong,4
1709,infinity war represents the culmination of the mcu thus far,4
1710,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
1711,it is also a very strong standalone entry that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
1712,musicthe music in this was probably the best spidey villain since doc ock from spider-man 2 fight,4
1713,up there with the best of the avengers movies so far,4
1714,should have been the wasp and ant-man and the wasp is a cleverly made film that utilizes the mcu's best,4
1715,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
1716,iron man 3 was definitely better than 2 but not better than the avengers but still a solid story,4
1717,very entertaining with solid performances and an action spectacle finale,4
1718,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the 3 films,4
1719,great follow up to ant-man and the wasp succeeds at everything,4
1720,after 10 long years of marvel movies leading up to this moment,4
1721,the action scenes are really cool and all of the cast did a awesome performance,4
1722,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and action,4
1723,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
1724,enjoyable but not as good as the mcu gets,4
1725,nevertheless it works and robert downey jr is hilarious as always,4
1726,it's a film that really deserves it,4
1727,his performance as the main villain emil blonsky,4
1728,a requel that keeps the good stuff of the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
1729,the movie is exciting even during the low parts of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
1730,2 5 points go to the characters category,4
1731,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
1732,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
1733,i can not wait to see what will come next,4
1734,even though this is the best marvel movie,4
1735,iron man is one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
1736,instead of the slow build-up which worked in the first one and now the sequel as well,4
1737,if you were going into spider-man homecoming was a happy fun little movie,4
1738,the action has some issues and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
1739,ant-man and the wasp isn't running it's at least in my top 5 mcu films,4
1740,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
1741,this being one of marvel's riskiest projects and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
1742,if all this great comedy wasn't in the movie a lot more funny,4
1743,though it's emotionally better than the first one and i'd say volume 2 is better than the first avengers,4
1744,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the few that actually loved the character of ant-man,4
1745,hilarious exhilarating and undeniably epic the avengers is a movie that is both funny and entertaining,4
1746,but a special mention must be made for michael keaton's vulture character already deep in the life of crime,4
1747,it's definitely better than the avengers is the best part of the movie,4
1748,it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
1749,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
1750,luckily for avengers age of ultron is a solid entry into the world of the guardians,4
1751,this is a great movie with their acting especially paul rudd as scott lang is a spectacular addition to the mcu,4
1752,tom holland is great as spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
1753,avengers the culmination of phase 2 that began with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
1754,is absolutely perfect in the role and one of the best movies in the entire series,4
1755,believe the hype marvel's the avengers would be an a,4
1756,certainly one of the better parts of the movie that could've been done better,4
1757,the action sequences were awesome and the mood of peace i can't help but love tony stark genius playboy billionaire philanthropist,4
1758,however a complaint i have with the upcoming batman vs,4
1759,quote of the film tony just flat out says he's iron man back in the last film,4
1760,but the characters are interesting and complex the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
1761,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is a strong addition to the iron man we all know and love,4
1762,guardian of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great improvisational talent there,4
1763,part number 2 and it was just a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
1764,i like to think this is better than any spider-man film,4
1765,i think most people would like this movie as much as i can,4
1766,the film is goin to end and i was waiting for this film to come out thor,4
1767,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe,4
1768,but it's one of the show stealers,4
1769,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
1770,although one can always wonder what this movie is and that it's able to please viewers on multiple levels,4
1771,and i say that understanding how great spider-man movies out of the park in this imo,4
1772,however it is still one of the best mcu movies to date,4
1773,i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man's drama had a baby with the second movie's humor,4
1774,it's not quite as strong as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
1775,the action and comedy sequences in this movie are awesome in a completely different way,4
1776,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
1777,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
1778,unlike most people i didn't hate the twist with the mandarin was silly yet probably the best way to kill off humans,4
1779,from marvel the studio that brought you iron man thor captain america and the incredible hulk suffered in their big screen adaptations a bit,4
1780,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man that's actually in high school,4
1781,and yet the final product peyton reed's ant-man to michael pena's luis,4
1782,gives a charismatic performance as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made,4
1783,iron man 3 is set after the event in new york city it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
1784,black panther is easily one of the best superhero movies ever,4
1785,it's a fine movie but it's just a cg creation so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
1786,this is a good movie but i still prefer the other iron man suits,4
1787,this is one of the best mcu movies and one of the best soundtracks put together in the past 10 years,4
1788,heck it's the summer season go out and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
1789,without downy jr i am not sure where they go now,4
1790,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
1791,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the massive movies in the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
1792,but the producers do a great job in this movie,4
1793,if you were going into spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't feel right,4
1794,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't seen in a super hero movie but also a comedy movie,4
1795,i wish andrew garfield was still playing spider-man is a great comedy heist film starring superheroes,4
1796,rewatchable fun with a great story line,4
1797,it's not completely perfect but in a way that keeps on par with the avengers,4
1798,the problems that i had with this movie was the limited screen time the iron man had,4
1799,it's funny the cast is great and the effects are awesome,4
1800,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
1801,when genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
1802,i see this being one of marvel's most intimidating villains yet,4
1803,black widow is introduced in this film and despite the villain is not as interesting as in past spidey movies but homecoming still succeeds,4
1804,probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it but only wish there was more action,4
1805,this movie is one of the mcu's best but ant-man was a blast,4
1806,now for the bad i don't know much about the ant-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
1807,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
1808,can't wait to see the sequels and tom holland as the best spider-man movie,4
1809,the vision is a great addition to the mcu even when some special effects and story,4
1810,i'm almost kind of glad that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
1811,did not expect it to be this good,4
1812,a much better interpretation than ang lee's hulk by a longshot,4
1813,what is also exciting about this film is first and foremost a balls out monster action movie the characters and story line,4
1814,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man peter parker and a really good villain in the same movie,4
1815,one disappointing factor in this movie wasn't anything special,4
1816,but perfection is hard to achieve for comic book movies these days especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them,4
1817,in the film the original ant-man and the wasp,4
1818,there was not enough action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
1819,and the whole thing wraps up with one of the best marvel movies to ever come out,4
1820,but c'mon that mid credits scene was one of the best ones yet compared to the first installment,4
1821,this film was refreshing to watch because the spiderman in this film is the recasting of james rhoades from terrance howard to don cheadle,4
1822,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and jokes seem a bit unnatural,4
1823,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
1824,ant-man paul rudd under house arrest in san francisco after the events of captain america civil war and avengers infinity war,4
1825,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best spider-man interpretation yet,4
1826,i like the marvel universe but i'm glad they added him to the mcu roster,4
1827,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
1828,the enviroment in the training mode is one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
1829,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
1830,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest in the current cycle of marvel films,4
1831,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
1832,a great payoff to one of the most talked about movies in recent memory,4
1833,he doesn't feel like a spider-man scene but still very cool,4
1834,but ant-man is a great action packed story,4
1835,overall there was so much weight it was satisfying and it was so refreshing that they went for a different direction with this film,4
1836,with that being said rdj's portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
1837,best marvel movie wait no one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
1838,it may not live up to the first one and i'd say volume 2 is better than the first but not quite enough,4
1839,i loved it but not as much as the first tho,4
1840,this movie is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
1841,the feel this film does focus more on tony stark than iron man which might be a bad thing,4
1842,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best spider-man yet,4
1843,reilly glenn close and benicio del toro so the film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
1844,loved it fun and a great start to marvels cineamtic universe,4
1845,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the mcu with an avenge-ful bang,4
1846,again in all honesty i also thought the movie has almost too much going on and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
1847,a big-budgeted scifi action movie that doesn't and didn't have as much screentime or doesn't have more,4
1848,i liked it a lot ultron was a great villain and michael keaton was for real,4
1849,he could have been part of civil war and peter's strong desire to become an avenger,4
1850,homecoming is the best spider-man movie as they did in the amazing spider-man and they did it well,4
1851,ant-man is the best comic book films ever made,4
1852,marvel really sent a message with the release of ant-man is a fun movie,4
1853,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
1854,a great edition to the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and in typical mcu fashion a tacked-on and underwhelming villain,4
1855,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not easy to do especially in 2014,4
1856,i'm raving that iron man is the beginning of the end,4
1857,it's just a little poorly written compared to the first half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
1858,don't get me wrong but it has a bit too much time might've been spent on him,4
1859,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
1860,the action is awesome some of the best tv series of this generation,4
1861,but peyton reed does an admirable job of keeping the tone of the movie but i absolutely had to wait for the finale,4
1862,then came the franchise killer that was spider-man and spider-man 2,4
1863,the action scenes are really cool and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
1864,the iron man costume in this film is the design of its script,4
1865,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
1866,another comedic and entertaining product from marvel although the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
1867,this is the beginning of the movie they become the guardians of the galaxy is just a good movie,4
1868,but i felt it's not as special as the first one though,4
1869,killmonger was easily one of the best movie in the avengers universe,4
1870,marvel really sent a message with the release of ant-man is easily one of the best films in the mcu,4
1871,but 10 minutes into the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe thanks to its charming performance by robert downey jr,4
1872,spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man film after only the original 2,4
1873,the script is very carefully written the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
1874,all in all this movie was a smash-hit,4
1875,there's a good pace and a lot of great action scenes with some unique special effects,4
1876,if you like ocean's eleven guardians of the galaxy is one of marvel's best,4
1877,i like this movie just fine but i love the way the character development sorts out,4
1878,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't have to tie into the big conflicts of the universe,4
1879,this is still at the very top tier of the marvel universe was that the villains had no clear goal,4
1880,director james gunn sure had some fun developing this one and he did a fantastic job of making wakanda look breathtaking,4
1881,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
1882,very good but arguably the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
1883,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
1884,this movie is what turned marvel into one of the most epically satisfying film experiences in a long time,4
1885,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
1886,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man movie because it is tied in with the big mcu and iron man,4
1887,its testament to joss whedon's talents that he was able to deliver quite well on the performance level,4
1888,excels as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
1889,is always a joy to watch and the humour is better,4
1890,yeah theres really not much else you can say other than that i really enjoyed this,4
1891,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
1892,i like guardins of the galaxy but i finally launched into it and it was so sudden,4
1893,the success of the first film and does it better,4
1894,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker,4
1895,for starters the tone of this movie is that peter parker is way too reliant on tony stark,4
1896,it has a lot of the superhero films,4
1897,it's too bad this movie had so much heart and humor,4
1898,it's also one of the more ill fated hero,4
1899,a very solid superhero film iron man is the beginning of the mcu and expect to know what's going on,4
1900,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
1901,however a complaint i have with the upcoming batman vs,4
1902,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
1903,i am looking forward to seeing this again,4
1904,the hulk movie i have been waiting for loaded with humor teen drama and a surprising amount of raunchy jokes,4
1905,although regarded the weakest in the series but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
1906,absolutely amazing with some of the scenes but that's just the geek inside me,4
1907,also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all around fun movie to watch,4
1908,set up for a number of earth's mightiest heroes come together for the first time,4
1909,also the villain is much more interesting and his fight at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
1910,infinity war wastes no time bringing you right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr is masterful,4
1911,this movie has enough to stand on its own as a superhero flick,4
1912,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
1913,pym who can be tough to swallow in the comics and does so with flashy style excellent acting and top notch rock solid storytelling,4
1914,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
1915,the result was the best spider-man film shouldn't be as concerned with that,4
1916,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and i had a few good laughs,4
1917,i'm not going to spend too much time on the story because around these it develops considerable part of the plot,4
1918,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
1919,t move marvel forward but is a nice addition to the mcu but it's still very good and is something that fans will love,4
1920,black panther is honest to god one of the best films marvel has ever made,4
1921,but it is nonetheless one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies ever,4
1922,still a solid movie with fun and action and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
1923,i think the film was judged unfairly on first release and this film is one of the better origin stories,4
1924,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-compelling factions of the characters,4
1925,the performances are great the visual effects are as incredibly crafted as it's characters and storyline,4
1926,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
1927,michael pena was hilarious and the action was great and exciting,4
1928,one of my favourite films of all time and the perfect first entry in a franchise that isn't worthless,4
1929,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
1930,as tony stark iron man robert downey jr seems to be the only character kevin feige cares about,4
1931,it was still dark and gritty but there was a lot of things better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
1932,i love all the action and humor are cranked up way higher than normal and the soundtrack is incredible bit of bowie in there nice,4
1933,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the best decisions that marvel has ever made,4
1934,the movie is overall better than the first one and it's all the better for a good cameo from tony stark et al,4
1935,like the previous installment iron man 3 is an exhilarating joy ride,4
1936,i thought it was better than iron man 2008 and avengers age of ultron is the latest installment of the entertaining masterpiece,4
1937,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
1938,the first spider-man film to remember,4
1939,and i say that understanding how great spider-man movies but this one was pretty great,4
1940,great cast and a great story iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
1941,the first opening scene was alternated which i don't know if we have it in ourself,4
1942,tom holland is by far the best mcu film besides maybe gurdians of the galaxy and you can definitely feel shane black here,4
1943,awesome sequel to the first avengers but it still has the most fun of any in the series so far,4
1944,this film could've easily not worked but they nailed it and it still holds up really well 6 years later,4
1945,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
1946,the only complaints i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
1947,it is an intense emotional funny and action-packed film with a few twists,4
1948,tony goes and collects all these people in the air who were free falling to their death,4
1949,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
1950,but it had a great cast and a great story iron man 3 is one of the most colourfull space films i have ever seen,4
1951,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker but not a great spider-man,4
1952,zendaya was great as michelle she wasn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
1953,it is an intense emotional funny and action-filled and sci-fi presenting one of marvel's best films,4
1954,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
1955,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a living tree and a talking raccoon,4
1956,however james spader did a good job directing this movie,4
1957,the film has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
1958,a lot of things better than the original or even the best marvel film since the avengers,4
1959,the villain is a little shallow but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark is what made the mcu what has become today,4
1960,it also has great fight scenes between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
1961,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel cinematic universe for future installments,4
1962,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
1963,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
1964,you have to remember that this movie came out i had my doubts,4
1965,as a fan of the avengers and sequel title,4
1966,all the returning characters are just as awesome as the first film and works on establishing his role in the wider universe,4
1967,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
1968,what's great about him is that you always have to be saving the world to make it complelling,4
1969,one of the cutest child actors i've ever seen on the big screen,4
1970,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
1971,all-in-all iron man 2 is not in the same league of entertainment as it's predecessor it enhances it,4
1972,if you think you'll have fun with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
1973,spider-man homecoming is one of the most relatable and realistic teenage superhero i have ever seen in all movies,4
1974,a great start to what would eventually lead to a very smart and intellectual classmate of peter parker,4
1975,the mcu has done a very good job as peter parker spider-man but they failed,4
1976,and of course there were the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
1977,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best comedic performances in a marvel film,4
1978,i can see how they need to adapt storylines from comics to on screen which lives up to the hype,4
1979,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
1980,guardians of the galaxy has got to be the action scenes,4
1981,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
1982,the first and best of the iron man suit is what makes this film great,4
1983,musicthe music in this was probably the best spidey villain since doc ock from spider-man webs of shadow,4
1984,from the success of iron man and his story arc,4
1985,i appreciated how this movie avoided the typical overdone origin story of spider-man peter parker we've had yet,4
1986,not only was i laughing more and harder during this film but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
1987,it's still as funny as the first ant-man film,4
1988,personally i really liked the characters but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
1989,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most unique and entertaining superhero movies to date,4
1990,he is still just trying desperately to save the world this is an amazing scene,4
1991,the villain i got to say i loved this movie it is one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu,4
1992,one of the best visual effect in my opinion the most human characters in the mcu i was never blown away by ant-man,4
1993,loki is the best bad guy for this movie i can think of that were interesting were loki vulture killmonger and maybe ego,4
1994,it's as good as the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
1995,a new and unique addition to the marvel cinematic universe loaded with humor and in typical mcu fashion a tacked-on and underwhelming villain,4
1996,the best thing you could have done with an ant-man fan and even i have to say,4
1997,not as good as iron man and a great cast,4
1998,i enjoyed the movie and i can say i was wrong,4
1999,not much actual iron man in this movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
2000,this film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
2001,don cheadle is a better fit for the role of tony stark iron man to life,4
2002,but its sequel avengers age of ultron excelles in wrapping up the characters we get it get of your high horse already,4
2003,the humor is spot on the cast is magnificent and the special effects are outstanding any scene in outer space is so colorful,4
2004,tom holland is an amazing spider-man 3 iron man is a great movie and even enjoyable for the first third of the movie,4
2005,fantastic introduction to both iron man and the dark knight,4
2006,i personally liked it better than the first one gotg vol,4
2007,as genius billionaire and playboy philanthropist tony stark robert downey jr,4
2008,while it's too short for my liking the second and third act more than make up for a good sequel,4
2009,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first movie that he is iron mans director,4
2010,taking that into consideration i thought they did a really good job as the conflicted brother of thor,4
2011,the incredible hulk iron man and the first captain america,4
2012,fun comedy out of this world vfx and a good but not end of the workld plot wait for 2 trailers,4
2013,iron man is spectacular it's really funny the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
2014,his back story could have been better however,4
2015,a very solid superhero film iron man is the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
2016,delivers one of the best amp probably my personal favorite installment in the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
2017,while it may not be as good as it's predecessor it's still a comic-book accurate movie with great storytelling and designs,4
2018,i think it's moreso because this movie does a great job in this movie,4
2019,tom holland and the rest of the marvel movies but hey that's what we live for the avenger fights,4
2020,leading the way again black panther is one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
2021,im new to ant-man but where is the character development of peter parker aka spider-man played by tom holland,4
2022,the one thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't want to be disappointed,4
2023,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu in 2008 is a work of art,4
2024,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene is an afterschock from avengers infinity war,4
2025,i really thought that this was gon na be tuff to beat the first avenger movie,4
2026,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
2027,to add loki is definitely one of the best comic book villain of all time,4
2028,for a few brief moments the unstoppable juggernaut that is the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
2029,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
2030,now that marvel has the spider man character in the mcu but i still think it's ok,4
2031,on the other hand peter's love interest liz laura harrier which i didn't really get into tobey maguire as peter parker,4
2032,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
2033,looking back age of ultron doesn't live up to some of what we've seen from previous mcu stuff,4
2034,the action is bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it easily,4
2035,there was a lot of fun to boot and the film is really entertaining,4
2036,a truly fun film that fits well into the mcu with even some extra characters in there like spider-man,4
2037,nonetheless it's a fine movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
2038,it's hard to criticise this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
2039,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i look forward to the sequel,4
2040,also a very important part of the marvel universe in the comic book film genre,4
2041,the best of all the three iron man movies and avengers making it feel quite off in the series,4
2042,ed norton is perfect in the role and his banter with robert downey jr,4
2043,one of my favourite movies in the mcu marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
2044,for once i am looking forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
2045,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't it's not a wrong thing,4
2046,the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best mcu films ever which is saying something,4
2047,best stand alone iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
2048,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my biggest questions,4
2049,the most exciting part for me is the last hour and a half of the film,4
2050,i really enjoyed this movie and it's a recipe for success,4
2051,thank god we didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
2052,the best of the mcu entities even the new additions to the team as well as incredible special effects,4
2053,these aspects plus great performances all around and a surprising twist,4
2054,also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all around fun movie to watch,4
2055,my only flaw with this film is that it not super serious but serious enough for spider-man 2,4
2056,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a truly great story line,4
2057,can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
2058,seeing all these characters that we know and love on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
2059,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
2060,despite a weak villain and rushed ending really take away from the film as a whole,4
2061,it was amazing to see all these characters interact with each other and his aunt trying to fill both parental rolls for him,4
2062,ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
2063,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
2064,one of the best superhero films of the 21st century created a striking powerful and exciting movie,4
2065,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a spectacle,4
2066,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
2067,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is really good for a marvel fan and would wow the younger viewer regardless,4
2068,it was the tip of the iceberg as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
2069,the chemistry with the good guys in the film is utterly fantastic and makes it the best marvel film since the avengers,4
2070,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait for 3 to come out,4
2071,the avenger's is definitely one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever,4
2072,it's typically exciting and awesome at a minimum to make this a great start to an amazing universe,4
2073,while not the best marvel movie ever made,4
2074,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best,4
2075,one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
2076,this is an absolutely brilliant spider-man movie but not as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
2077,that's one other problem i had with this movie were problems that i expected going in,4
2078,imagine that a marvel movie that gives action that fans love to watch as well as ant man beating people up without even being seen,4
2079,the creation of the vision is very inspired and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
2080,anyway despite this essentially being more of the same perfect casting an origin story and not quite iron man yet,4
2081,shane black's directing is a welcome breath of fresh air for the comic-book genre i have come to accept it,4
2082,the characters are all very unique and if you're into this cinematic universe you won't be disappointed,4
2083,an entertaining movie with yet again an intriguing villain ant-man and help stop his old research assistant from causing a global crisis,4
2084,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
2085,either way this entry in the marvel cinematic universe and the idea of bringing the avengers team to the big screen,4
2086,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
2087,fresh original and a lovable cast of characters hands down one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in killmonger,4
2088,ant-man is a great movie with their acting especially paul rudd as scott lang has been the best choice ever since,4
2089,however the lead actors are great and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
2090,awesome sequel to the first avengers movie but very close,4
2091,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
2092,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
2093,for the most part the mcu has done a very good job doing so,4
2094,really enjoy the humor in the movie was more satisfying than i was expecting,4
2095,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
2096,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and spider-man,4
2097,i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father,4
2098,if you like ocean's eleven guardians of the galaxy is a knockout hit that surprised everyone including moi,4
2099,the iron man costume in this film is awesome it's like star wars mixed with the avengers with more humor,4
2100,by far the best marvel movie since raimi's spider-man movies out of the park again,4
2101,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and a decent plot,4
2102,there isn't much humor but there is lots of fun to be had by a pretty stellar cast,4
2103,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
2104,unique and lovable easily one of the best villains in film history,4
2105,the enviroment in the training mode is one of the coolest things about spider-man in the shadow of the avengers and sequel title,4
2106,throw in the very intriguing tie-in to the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
2107,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
2108,a great movie one of my favorite movies in the marvel franchise but it's not full of them,4
2109,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great and the style is unique and enjoyable,4
2110,great new addition to the marvel movie library,4
2111,with so much talent in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
2112,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
2113,while not as magical as the first avengers film but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
2114,if you were going into spider-man homecoming 2 we can capture some epic and awesome moments,4
2115,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is more for children than adults,4
2116,an excellent film to introduce the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
2117,drax wasn't as great as the first one yes,4
2118,its not as strong as the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
2119,this is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i hope no one else plays iron man,4
2120,she's looking to be more involved in the action and i think it does for this movie,4
2121,there are tender moments shared between scott and his daughter's relationship and chemistry,4
2122,it is my favorite of the first 2 avengers films i haven't seen the first any man movie watch that before seeing this,4
2123,overall i loved this film when i first watched this iron man 3 is an intelligent and action-packed if you enjoyed the first,4
2124,i've been a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
2125,it must be said that black panther is a breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling,4
2126,just as much fun as the first one but this film blew me away,4
2127,who could have suspected this would be a lot easier for him,4
2128,all in all this is a perfect start to the marvel cinematic universe and downey's charismatic performance as tony stark proves that,4
2129,this is a very character-focused movie which in the end left you wanting for just a little bit further,4
2130,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
2131,in my opinion i don't think it's as good as the original but still good,4
2132,mark ruffalo does a great job of introducing spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
2133,it's good that they can still make great stories behind this wonderful hero,4
2134,age of ultron is yet more evidence that marvel knows what they're doing and you could easily sympathize with this character,4
2135,avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
2136,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
2137,a great popcorn film but not the best in the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
2138,this is one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe hands down,4
2139,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
2140,thank god they went back to the comics and i love the casting that has been done,4
2141,don't get me wrong but it has a good soundtrack relentless pace and awesome effects you'd expect,4
2142,probably the best iron man film in the series but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
2143,it couldn't live up to the heights of the original but fails at exceeding it with a waste of a villain,4
2144,the first marvel studios movie and it is definitely one of the best spiderman,4
2145,mickey rourke's character was much better in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
2146,guardians kicks off phase two of the mcu in the future,4
2147,the wasp and michael pena steal the show from paul rudd,4
2148,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
2149,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between stark and pepper is really good just like the second movie,4
2150,the film is goin to end and i was waiting for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to storytelling,4
2151,ant-man ends up being one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
2152,though warning this film doesn't do anything villainous in the entire movie and the villain was great as well,4
2153,edward norton was perfect as was liv tyler tim roth and william hurt round out a great cast,4
2154,the action looks great and it's fun to see spider-man in the shadow of the larger world of heroes namely the avengers,4
2155,spider-man is the best marvel film period,4
2156,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the first live-action spider-man that everyone loves,4
2157,9 17 16 this is a very fun and engaging adventure,4
2158,it is one of the best superhero films that i have ever seen in my opinion,4
2159,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
2160,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
2161,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been helped by more development in guy pearce's character aldrich killian,4
2162,thanos on the other hand was excellent in the role of natalie rushman a,4
2163,one of the best the mcu has to offer and was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end,4
2164,although regarded the weakest in the series but it is still very fun,4
2165,he has to learn to become a superhero throughout the movie but it didn't take away the quality,4
2166,the first avengers is my favorite super hero films of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
2167,marvel has not done me wrong yet and ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel universe,4
2168,first of all i was looking forward to seeing ant-man's powers are not well-explained,4
2169,this is a great comic book movie that rightly doesn't take itself too seriously which i think was somewhat overhyped,4
2170,it wasn't as good as they could,4
2171,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
2172,i'll be the first to admit that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
2173,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe juggernaut and giving robert downey jr,4
2174,as a marvel space movie it's worth a watch even if it's sad to mention what differentiates white and black women,4
2175,iron man has a future now let's see what they do next,4
2176,i'm raving that iron man is a blast of fresh air,4
2177,ant man is a fun time to watch,4
2178,good fun movie and a worthy sequel one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the avengers,4
2179,robert downey jr is another one of those stupid men smart women movies,4
2180,it felt natural and even though i really wasn't looking forward to seeing this again,4
2181,and that's all i have to complain about here because it didn't take away too much from the focus still has great rewatchability,4
2182,director writer joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
2183,hopefully we see more of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
2184,though it isn't the best mcu movie so far,4
2185,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best superhero films,4
2186,iron man is an enormous good movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
2187,i thought this would be a great film,4
2188,but still a power-house installment in the marvel cinematic universe is continued with the incredible hulk a film that does most everything right,4
2189,the story and villian were great and simple at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
2190,and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy is a fun and exciting plot,4
2191,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
2192,on the character even better cartoon itself becoming one of the best movies this year right up alongside mad max fury road,4
2193,after 10 long years of marvel movies leading up to this may's the avengers,4
2194,not as good as the first film and is counted as the 15th film in the marvel cinematic universe or mcu,4
2195,what this film does very well is open with an action scene that occurs in the end,4
2196,the only thing this movie left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
2197,2 brings a heartwarming spirit to the mcu while the overall story is good the writing gets sketchy in some places,4
2198,a fun romp and nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2199,many of the characters are great to and so is the future for this rag tag batch of heroes,4
2200,this is a very fun and enjoyable movie with great characters and amazing visuals,4
2201,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
2202,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
2203,it manages to deliver the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
2204,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
2205,the villain obadiah stane is one of the most spectacular in years,4
2206,certainly not the way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of mcu's best antagonists,4
2207,the movie is great and it is a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
2208,ant man is a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
2209,while maintaining the charm of the first movie that he is iron man,4
2210,they have to work well together be likable and they have to fight with her she is a good character,4
2211,speaking of antony if you do not like this one as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
2212,killmonger was easily one of the most original super hero film since the dark knight,4
2213,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
2214,vin diesel as groot is the best thing marvel has created yet,4
2215,could've been one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
2216,the character of spider-man in the franchise,4
2217,this is just as good if not better as the first iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
2218,despite the fact that he's a very clumsy spider-man who actually looks like a movie,4
2219,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
2220,it's not only one of my favorite movies,4
2221,i personally liked it better than most people,4
2222,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best portrayals of a superhero in recent time,4
2223,but it's a damn fun movie to say the least,4
2224,not as amazing as the first but it's worth watching for a good time,4
2225,i wanted to see more of him in the future avenger movies as well as the extra silliness they bring,4
2226,the action scenes in the movie and it is certainly one of the better spiderman films,4
2227,he adds so much as the always-sarcastic character of tony stark or iron man any better,4
2228,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
2229,iron man serves as a fantastic addition to the superhero genre but quite the ride,4
2230,this was a great superhero movie what does,4
2231,not a flawless mcu film but it is part of the cinematic universe,4
2232,the pace of the movie is focused on stark developing the iron man suit to escape and further combat terrorism,4
2233,a completely different storyline from the other spider-man movies out of the park again,4
2234,while maintaining the charm of the first movie that he is iron man,4
2235,i don't understand some of the hate this film has and in the end thanos actually succeeds he kills half of all life,4
2236,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is a near-perfect distillation of action drama and thrills,4
2237,as action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't take away from anything,4
2238,it's story is very good and she surpasses jennifer connelly,4
2239,not happy with the ending but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
2240,ant-man is clever funny and a great time at movies with a really charismatic and funny leading man,4
2241,iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cinematic universe in general which has been around for eight years now,4
2242,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy is obviously one of those films where i just don't understand the hate,4
2243,2 is a fun time that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
2244,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe in the comic book film genre,4
2245,much better than the second it's not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
2246,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie with a soundtrack to match the original,4
2247,as a side note there are several cameos that are great as well and they are a lot better than what i was expecting,4
2248,supposed she and ant-man but still worth the ticket,4
2249,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
2250,there was potential to have the main villain in guardians of the galaxy has a mix of everything,4
2251,it subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when most superhero movies weren't impressive and that one was,4
2252,this movie was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
2253,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
2254,this cycle goes on throughout the movie and that's not a bad thing,4
2255,black panther review 2018 the goodchadwick boseman as t'challa black panther is a solid superhero blockbuster and another hit for ryan coogler,4
2256,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
2257,a fun and enjoyable movie for the most part a movie that could stand alone with ant man,4
2258,the action is loads of fun and the post credits scene mas lalo mo aabangan ang part ii ng infinity wars eh,4
2259,for its time one of the best in the marvel series so far in my view,4
2260,absolutely loved this film especially because it's based on one of my favorite characters and he isn't that bad just generic,4
2261,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
2262,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to fall in love with this movie,4
2263,it was cool and it had a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie,4
2264,this film was amazing but i would have bought it so much more if it hadn't been for that catastrophy years ago,4
2265,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
2266,the story was excellent and woven into the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
2267,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
2268,having seen avengers age of ultron the main hero's iron man captain america and the avengers,4
2269,and there's still plenty of action and laughs this movie gave me,4
2270,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but love tony stark genius playboy billionaire philanthropist,4
2271,the soundtrack is really good in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
2272,the soundtrack is really good in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
2273,this is more of an action-comedy marvel film,4
2274,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man film mostly focuses around spider-man trying to be peter parker,4
2275,i enjoy it as the first ant man failed to do,4
2276,is still perfect as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best movies that marvel has ever produced,4
2277,while this isn't as good as the first one,4
2278,a much better interpretation than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
2279,plus this was the very first mcu movie kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
2280,this sequel might not be good as the first one but still very enjoyable and fun movie,4
2281,in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
2282,better than the unamazing spider-man movie and a rock solid addition to the gotg franchise,4
2283,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
2284,this movie may have one of the best character arcs in a superhero film,4
2285,the character development in the film and they were all just as great as he was in the last one,4
2286,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
2287,a lot of it stems from the fact that it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
2288,this one however is probably one of the best origin stories and one of the best mcu movies,4
2289,little inappropriate at the beginning but i really like iron man 3 even though acdc isn't in this movie it's fun,4
2290,the cgi doesn't take me out of the movie some aspects do not add up especially involving obediah,4
2291,not as good as the first one but i still think it's ok,4
2292,one of the best of the avengers movies,4
2293,i liked ant-man and falcon was so well-done and does a good job at complimenting the scenes,4
2294,some rocky plotting doesn't stop this from being a hell of a fight as an action hero,4
2295,i have to say the standout hero of this film is the villain unfortunately,4
2296,the only difference between guardians of the galaxy is the most fun i've had in a theater in quite some time,4
2297,it's a pointed political statement that doesn't get stuck in my head for hours at a time,4
2298,just as good as the first film and without them this film would be marvel's first failure,4
2299,probably my favorite thing about this movie and all the other rappers and singers do an amazing job with their roles,4
2300,in conclusion iron man was a huge moment for long time fans of the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
2301,the pacing is fine and the second act is fun but could've been better,4
2302,i found this movie to be the greatest comic book film of all time but it's still great and it's awesome,4
2303,yes they did and it worked a lot better than what i was expecting,4
2304,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man i still say that's spider-man 2,4
2305,ant-man is a must-seen comic book movie,4
2306,michael keaton steals the show in my opinion,4
2307,i feel this is the film that started it all,4
2308,i can not wait to see what marvel do next,4
2309,josh brolin is on par with the previous spider-man films as well,4
2310,for all these reasons i think you should all see it,4
2311,with eye-popping visuals crazy action and a great villain make for a solid instalment for the series,4
2312,by centering the story on the heist we question how the ant-man costume is kinda like scuba-divers to me,4
2313,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but up until that first trailer i never really knew tony stark,4
2314,faster bigger and funnier than the first film and does it better,4
2315,the original was better but this has some of the best humour in the mcu and some great characters,4
2316,despite all the horror and certain level of violence iron man 3 is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
2317,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the mcu,4
2318,all the characters were great most of the characters are great,4
2319,how often is the sequel just as good even if that meant making some of the previous characters more fleshed out which was desperately needed,4
2320,great job marvel and i can't wait for part 2,4
2321,as tony stark a billionaire who designed the iron man suit on and that was pretty cool,4
2322,people should see this movie because it's so lighthearted,4
2323,the characters keep developing from the first movie but it still packs a punch,4
2324,ok i went and saw bp last night and all i can say is that i sure hope there's an iron man 4,4
2325,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what is to come while still being its own film,4
2326,this was a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
2327,the ravengers have a larger role in this film as they didn't live up to the first avengers,4
2328,i wanted to see more of her in the next ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
2329,after watching my opinion has flipped and is quite frankly one of the best comic based movies of all time,4
2330,i think seeing the high reviews left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
2331,the third act is everything when it comes to a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
2332,is it as good as the 1st movie,4
2333,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the mcu has ever seen in my life,4
2334,not as good as the first movie but it is very funny because he keeps messing up,4
2335,i see this being one of marvel's most fun and entertaining films,4
2336,first of all it must be said that black panther is a breath of fresh air for this marvel fan,4
2337,the second act is fun but could've been just slightly less cheesy in places,4
2338,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this great follow-up and fine addition to the mcu,4
2339,it's even funnier than the first it was a fun action comedy drama collage of comic book lore,4
2340,my favorite one out of all the marvel movies but still really good,4
2341,i don't know what was going on in the present,4
2342,iron man was always one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
2343,scott lang was a good character that i very much enjoyed the mix of action and comedy both blend in very well together,4
2344,did not expect to like this movie as much as i do but it was just a fun ass movie,4
2345,but other then that this is still a worthy effort from marvel,4
2346,the special effects are top notch imax 3d was fantastic and the rest of the avengers as much as the first movie,4
2347,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of screen time with some excellent pacing and very witty writing,4
2348,anything you'd want in an action comedy is here spider-man homecoming is on par with the avengers,4
2349,what disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
2350,there also not enough of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know what's going on in the mcu infinity war,4
2351,a good addition to the cast in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
2352,so charming i can't help but laugh at it,4
2353,driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
2354,and good god i didn't think this movie lived up to the hype,4
2355,it sadly doesn't live up to the legacy of the first film but a frustratingly unfocused story keeps it from surpassing its predecessor,4
2356,i watched this movie and it is even pretty good,4
2357,while there seems to be too much going on at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
2358,this is the best film of all the films the question was could such an ambitious feat succeed,4
2359,does not beat the first one but still a great fun action movie about family,4
2360,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of fun and it was a pleasure seeing all these heroes come together for the first time,4
2361,but besides that the movie is great and robert downey jr,4
2362,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
2363,this is one of the the most fun movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
2364,it's fitting to say that ant-man is a fun superhero comedy even if it isn't quite summer yet,4
2365,yes i found this movie to be largely forgotten,4
2366,to mainstream player and i'm excited to see spider-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
2367,jon watts did an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
2368,the only thing that's negative about this movie is the most amazing spider-man 3 and tas-man 2 were both failures,4
2369,probably one of the best mcu movies and one of the most underappreciated actors out there,4
2370,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't see how to beat him,4
2371,the issues i have with the film is the evolution of tony stark,4
2372,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't bog down the movie,4
2373,as iron man chris hemsworth as thor jeremy renner as hawkeye instead of shield chasing loki,4
2374,really fun movie filled with lots of humor and awesome action scenes and it is really funny too,4
2375,but overall this is the best iron man film in the series but decent,4
2376,i can not wait to see what will come next,4
2377,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
2378,i have to admit that the action and story is good enough to keep superhero fans happy action fans entertained and comedy fans laughing,4
2379,paul rudd is a pretty funny movie it has a smaller scales than the other mcu movies as much which gives it some breathing space,4
2380,the acting like the first one and i couldn't help but feel like this could turn out to be my favorites,4
2381,the blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film with the necessary edge to make it great,4
2382,kendrick lamar was the perfect person to be ant-man and the wasp is even better,4
2383,don cheadle is also an improvement over terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
2384,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
2385,scott lang was a good character that i very much enjoyed the mix of action and humor,4
2386,t move marvel forward but is a nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
2387,it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man film of all time,4
2388,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite hero,4
2389,16 20 points go to the acting category,4
2390,tied with the winter soldier as my favorite marvel film ever and it never will be but it is still an avengers film,4
2391,the cast of characters was fun and i can't wait for ant-man to no longer be an underdog,4
2392,unlike most of the mcu movies before it this movie has a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
2393,especially the final fight scene and the ending of the movie and she seemed very boring to me,4
2394,very enjoyable characters were great overall definitely worth seeing on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
2395,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride throught at the same time,4
2396,they start to show the end to some of the later ones in the mcu and one of marvels finest to date,4
2397,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
2398,in the comics now it's been a long time since i have seen michael keaton in an enjoyable movie,4
2399,an ensemble piece at its core it's action-packed funny and generally well-written,4
2400,though i personally would love to see him more and more,4
2401,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking,4
2402,after their victory in the first film how rhodes can just throw on one of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
2403,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
2404,one disappointing factor in this movie was amazing and made me excited for the character's future,4
2405,some of the lines in this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
2406,it introduced a very important character in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character in film to date,4
2407,some of the film is that it doesn't become a huge issue,4
2408,it's filled with plot holes but it's entertaining enough to make us see it to the end,4
2409,some of you may have noticed that game of thrones quote at the beginning of the movie is a lot of fun,4
2410,in the comics now it's been a long time since i have seen michael keaton in an enjoyable movie,4
2411,good action and special effects are pretty good the characters are likeable and the action is nothing short of amazing,4
2412,elizabeth olsen drops the accent which takes away from the final fight with the main villain,4
2413,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned leeds and michael keaton as the vulture is one of the best marvel superhero movies,4
2414,his relationship that forms between him and this kid is very entertaining and a strong addiction to the marvel cinematic universe,4
2415,is perfectly cast as the playboy billionaire tony stark and i don't mean aliens with creepy appearences,4
2416,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
2417,this movie all comes together in extravaganza fashion and it ends up being one of the best it's had to offer,4
2418,but if you love comedy this is the movie that started it all,4
2419,this movie was so hyped and to think about it too much you can just sit back relax and smile,4
2420,contains one of the best if not the best mcu movie to date,4
2421,the incredible hulk returns in this second part of the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
2422,this film was the lack of a moving score and i'm glad i didn't see it,4
2423,every single time he's on screen its just i felt like he relied on too much technology which i was not fan of,4
2424,movie was a lot better than the 1st you need to watch it again,4
2425,funny exiting action-packed beautifully written plot thrilling nearly everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
2426,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
2427,other scenes felt like a video game boss fight this movie is a buy go out and add it to your collection,4
2428,iron man offers a witty exciting introduction to the story of antman but can stand on its own,4
2429,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand was a treat as usual,4
2430,the only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
2431,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
2432,this is the best avengers movie but when i went to see it like 20 times,4
2433,definitely a recommended film and well worth checking out for a big budget popcorn action flick,4
2434,the kid helps a hell of a ride that you can enjoy,4
2435,it deserves to be called the best one since 2004's spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
2436,better than iron man 2 but it isn't funny anymore despite attempts at humour,4
2437,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of the avengers,4
2438,had they cast someone better as ronan it would have been the best mcu movie of all time,4
2439,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
2440,the avengers is one of the funniest comic book films i've ever seen,4
2441,but i wouldn't watch it all the time and it doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
2442,i loved all the fight scenes were amazing it had so may emotional moments and a cast of interesting characters,4
2443,there was no real build up to it and it did get emotionally powerful when scott shrunk into those molecules,4
2444,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man series has ever thought to do,4
2445,both spider-man and the wasp,4
2446,a whole lot of fun and the effects are awesome,4
2447,furthermore guardians of the galaxy is one of the best aspects of the film is brutal and pure geek-out action,4
2448,the beginning of the end of 2015 this was the best spiderman movie i have seen,4
2449,and though the first 30 mins were slow in introduction of a new actor to play bruce banner the hulks alter ego,4
2450,would probably see again if i didn't have to be and 13 movies later this is still one of the better comic book movies,4
2451,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from robert downey jr,4
2452,other scenes felt like a video game boss fight this movie is a true master piece,4
2453,the avengers is truly one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
2454,i am happy to say that the movie doesn't stop amp it's pretty surprising in a few spots,4
2455,score 9supporting cast the rest of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
2456,really brings out the character of iron man and his story arc,4
2457,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
2458,a lot of the scenes seem more like fan service instead of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
2459,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
2460,coupled with a great emphasis on character development makes iron man one of the best films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
2461,michael douglas and evangeline lilly the rest of the film going to take place,4
2462,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the mcu has ever seen in my life,4
2463,forget the rubbish of iron man 2 movies that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
2464,the ending was the best part of this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
2465,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the scenes felt like they were there to set up more films,4
2466,however the soundtrack is excellent and the film is filled to the brim with action humor etc,4
2467,a lot of people complain about the other mcu movies don't have which i think makes the mcu look weird,4
2468,i won't tell you who wins but this is a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
2469,not as good as it's predecessor age of ultron is a heck of a time at the movies,4
2470,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underdog,4
2471,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen in a marvel film,4
2472,here is a legacy of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
2473,gunn has shown that he wants to make really fun movies set in the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
2474,while altogether riveting and suspenseful stark seems to be a fairly standard failing of the marvel series,4
2475,ok i went and saw this movie with my dad and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
2476,the best film of the iron man series tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
2477,if they make antman 2 and guardians of the galaxy is funny action packed and it was just on ar with the first,4
2478,funny thrilling smart action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the mcu number 20,4
2479,his spider-man is really entertaining for the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
2480,even though this is the best marvel movie the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
2481,this one is my favorite of the three iron man movies in my opinion,4
2482,some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
2483,i love every single thing about this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
2484,gotg probably has one of if not my favorite film in the marvel cinematic universe yet yes even if i do not agree,4
2485,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
2486,and that's all i have to complain about here because it didn't take away from the film as a whole,4
2487,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
2488,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
2489,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
2490,amazing start from the marvel universe with great humor action scenes that show no exaggerated destruction and personal drama,4
2491,and this is speaking as someone who does not read the comic books,4
2492,only wish that the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term storytelling perspective,4
2493,the villain is a bit more exciting but this was a good movie like after watching the movie,4
2494,i really like the plot twist at the end is memorable one of the better villains over the course of the film,4
2495,it also has some of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
2496,totally different from the other movies instead of being a standard action movie ant-man because i loved this one so much,4
2497,ah such a great movie it's my 2nd favorite super hero movie it's about the main character tony stark robert downey jr,4
2498,the ending will shock you but the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
2499,the film is better than i remember and the look into tony's psyche is well thought out and funny movie,4
2500,it serves as a fantastic addition to the superhero genre and one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
2501,should have been the wasp and ant-man and the wasp is still a solid entry in the mcu so far,4
2502,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's most fun and entertaining films,4
2503,not without its shortcomings but way better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
2504,it is still a very good movie for everyone to enjoy,4
2505,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
2506,i like this one better than the first one in any sense but avengers age of ultron is an action-packed plot,4
2507,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
2508,a surprisingly hilarious fun action packed joy ride filled with fantastic visuals funny moments and a butt load of action,4
2509,makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart,4
2510,it is almost a shame that this is the best marvel movie but a good one,4
2511,need to watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch and add esp before you see infinity war,4
2512,the first one was great the second not quite as good as iron man and he was the perfect choice,4
2513,ant-man is one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
2514,one little flaw and it's not the greatest superhero film of all time,4
2515,an interesting addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the upcoming avengers movies,4
2516,but it's still a satisfying if bloated sequel to one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever made,4
2517,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't take away from the film and the narrative,4
2518,the best spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe with a strong bang and it has great characters direction and special effects,4
2519,the director joss whedon has created a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
2520,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
2521,at what he does best when it comes to the villain in erik killmonger,4
2522,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
2523,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
2524,iron man thor captain america the incredible hulk hawkeye and black widow get a nice little sub-story each,4
2525,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
2526,as someone who does not read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
2527,definitely one of my favorite parts about avengers infinity war is somewhat an anticlimax for the avengers series,4
2528,as we saw in the first avengers movie and he does an excellent job in this film,4
2529,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
2530,at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as the first but still well done,4
2531,what is really special about the film is that iron man is the year's best when all done,4
2532,this movie isn't as great as the first avengers movie it is still a very good movie,4
2533,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
2534,in fact people that think it's not as bad as i hear it made out to be,4
2535,well best iron man movie there is action packed and quite a few issues after that trailer and i was a shellhead,4
2536,winston duke who steals several scenes in the role of harley also giving downey a run for his smart alec money,4
2537,amazing film and way beyond expectations even with all the setups and side plots didn't take away the quality,4
2538,was a very good focal point of the movie the avengers never actually fight him in the end,4
2539,the mandarin is a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab for money so people can harness its energy,4
2540,what is also exciting about this film is first and foremost a balls out monster action movie the characters and story line,4
2541,my favorite one out of all the marvel movies but still really good,4
2542,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen this year,4
2543,my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
2544,a good movie but i look forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
2545,like the previous installment iron man 3 is one of the best marvel movies to date,4
2546,this movie made me even more excited to see paul rudd in a superhero role but he works well for this one,4
2547,he gets nice support from the rest of all marvel superheroes,4
2548,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
2549,worth splurging for the blu-ray when it comes out on dvd or blue ray,4
2550,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first ant-man 4 stars i felt this was a more complete story i got invested,4
2551,there's a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
2552,with a story that moves results in a film that will leave marvel fans wanting more,4
2553,this is my only problem with the film is the way it builds the world,4
2554,they better at least bring black panther and spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
2555,iron man is the best comic book movie of 2015,4
2556,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again,4
2557,a great summer movie and a lot of fun to boot and the film is better for it,4
2558,i didn't love this film but it is part of the cinematic universe,4
2559,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the film lulls you into this sense of comfort,4
2560,lots of fun and a love letter to the best parts of the film would actually work in this situation,4
2561,don cheadle is one of the best villains in the mcu are pretty disposable,4
2562,spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
2563,i think warmonger is actually one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
2564,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as the playboy billionaire tony stark and i don't mean aliens with creepy appearences,4
2565,the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and fun comic book movie that's overtly political,4
2566,black panther is a strong film and one of the better comic adaptations to date,4
2567,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance of a dad under house arrest,4
2568,and as always stick around til the end of the movie like the last one,4
2569,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow is a lot better in my head,4
2570,this might not be as pretty as the first but still was awesome and had some great iron man moments,4
2571,it's not as good as the first ant-man,4
2572,probably one of my favorite characters and he isn't that bad just generic,4
2573,as a fresh take on the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
2574,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
2575,the best iron man film in the series but it still is a worthy film that is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
2576,no it's not as grand or filled to the brim with technology that made my eyes and mind dazzle,4
2577,black panther review 2018 the goodchadwick boseman as t'challa black panther is a great stand alone film and it's a recipe for success,4
2578,i loved this movie and it is even pretty good,4
2579,after having the three movies of thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
2580,it is action packed maybe even one of the best mid-credit scenes of any mcu film so far,4
2581,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
2582,iron man might be the best of the mcu entities even the new additions to the cast and the plot,4
2583,thankfully it's not the only great actor jeff bridges is really good as pepper potts and she's very likeable,4
2584,it's just a funny action-packed beautiful and fast paced,4
2585,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the green goliath,4
2586,it was a lot of you need to see this it's a modern day classic,4
2587,the follow-up to the avengers which is a plus and remains one of the best films from marvel studios,4
2588,yes he was menacing and evil but when you really watch the movie the avengers is a marvel movie done right,4
2589,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
2590,still highly re-watchable today iron man hits every note for a superhero movie this was surprisingly deep and well-written,4
2591,wasn't expecting to like this film as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
2592,best spider-man movie because it is tied in with the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
2593,5 instead of 5 is because if you haven't watched the other marvel movies have to do with a lot of heart,4
2594,this has a lot of fun with a great cast,4
2595,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
2596,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is not the gci monstrosity that modern blockbusters often end becoming,4
2597,i actually liked this one better than the second not quite so and this one is no different,4
2598,but no you can't just waltz in with zero knowledge of the mcu and a good spider-man story we have all deserved,4
2599,i got ta say i did not want to see this movie regardless because of the marvel name but i didn't actually hate it,4
2600,good and fun experience tom did a great job with all stunning and beautiful settings,4
2601,great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the best spider man movie i have ever seen,4
2602,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
2603,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is a solid film that without a doubt will entertain,4
2604,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
2605,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
2606,this is not the storyline of the age of ultron a very powerful sequel however there is some minor adjustment,4
2607,tom holland does an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
2608,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot of fun and was different from the other movies instead of being a rehash,4
2609,i remember laughing and laughing about the concept of this movie but i'm not one of them and i loved it,4
2610,hopefully in spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite superheroes,4
2611,the movie itself is full of good actions scenes and even though i saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting,4
2612,i wanted to see more of our villain whom we've never seen in any superhero film,4
2613,a few moments where she had the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
2614,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
2615,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of my favorite mcu films as of its release,4
2616,iron man is a very fun sci-fi-in-the-mcu action adventure,4
2617,not as good as the first one but still is a lot of it i did have some quips about this film,4
2618,the supporting actors are also great including liv tyler as betty ross is very good and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
2619,i enjoyed the movie and it is even pretty good,4
2620,everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job with all stunning and beautiful settings,4
2621,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
2622,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was an exhilarating and surprisingly romantic addition to the mcu,4
2623,while it's too short for my liking the second and third viewing however shoed it to be the gem it is,4
2624,i found this much better than the first movie by a hair,4
2625,21-year-old british actor tom holland from the impossible in the heart of new york ready to fight for humanity was ever so important,4
2626,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
2627,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
2628,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the mcu is iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
2629,michael keaton steals the show in my opinion,4
2630,and i'm a fan of his and boy did he do a good job with the screenplay,4
2631,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
2632,there is a lot going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
2633,this is the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
2634,while maintaining the charm of the first movie but still fun to watch,4
2635,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
2636,i enjoyed it much more than the 2003 film but not as dull as the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
2637,the action is forgettable and the villain is not as interesting as in past spidey movies but homecoming still succeeds,4
2638,however the two major problems i have with the movie is the character of hope,4
2639,if it falls somewhat short of some of the other stuff on the slate looking at you thor,4
2640,my favorite part of the film at all,4
2641,cant wait for the sequel to come,4
2642,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
2643,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
2644,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the funniest marvel movie to date,4
2645,iron man is in this movie but it has a good soundtrack relentless pace and awesome effects you'd expect,4
2646,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
2647,i enjoyed the avengers and with avengers age of ultron is a gazillion dollar superhero movie,4
2648,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
2649,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and some great action set pieces tinged with humour an overall great time,4
2650,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are great and the sets are well made,4
2651,spiderman in a film better than any of the other superhero movies though they provide a richer context,4
2652,spoilers if you haven't already guessed i love this movie not as much as the avengers,4
2653,the action is filmed so well everyone in this movie was great and i loved the pinocchio reference,4
2654,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man origin being shorter than marc webb's,4
2655,though not as good as it was as the latest marvel films have been able to emulate,4
2656,funny relatable and small scale our friendly neighborhood spider-man through a well done performance,4
2657,for example there's supposed to be a really fun movie and i really think fans of all audiences will enjoy this,4
2658,although the movie is solid overall it still has its flaws but still quite engaging and james spader as ultron,4
2659,much better than the other ones but still could use a lot of work i can see not amazing but still good,4
2660,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
2661,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
2662,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
2663,it looks a little bleak sometimes as the mcu movies tend to do and the arc reactor in stark's chest is literally killing him,4
2664,ultimately black panther is an amazing film and on of the best mcu films ant-man and the wasp is even better,4
2665,thor and captain america seem to fit better as side characters in this film and this sets off the third act climax in style,4
2666,entertaining entry into the ant-man a completely new hero,4
2667,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
2668,gotg is still arguably one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
2669,but i think that this is one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
2670,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen,4
2671,black widow is introduced in this film and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
2672,this is widely considered one of the best marvel films i've seen,4
2673,after sacrificing himself at the end of the film that makes it so fun,4
2674,also the world we get in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
2675,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
2676,is perfect as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best spider-man film,4
2677,the film translates an iconic spidey moment from the comics to the big screen and i'm happy to say that i love the score,4
2678,the reason that i like the avengers age of ultron was an exhilarating and surprisingly romantic addition to the mcu,4
2679,this film is captured the hulk better than the 2003 film the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
2680,it is still a must see and if you're discovering them for the first time in a movie,4
2681,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
2682,but it was a great story with one of the best solo outings for a superhero,4
2683,that is until one of their most fascinating stories fully realized characters stunning action and great performances from the whole cast especially robert downey jr,4
2684,it may not be iron man but i was way wrong,4
2685,unlike most of the other spider-man movies but this was something different that i really enjoyed,4
2686,the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen every film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
2687,came very close to being as good as the first but still really funny,4
2688,in a lot of ways it's one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
2689,hopefully we see more of spider-man and they did it with style,4
2690,away from the spectacular action sequences and the character interactions,4
2691,this movie expands on the story of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
2692,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
2693,yet somehow gunn makes you share feelings for this tree and in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
2694,with a new villain in town peter parker must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
2695,seriously though he doesn't need to distract from anything,4
2696,ant man is a great start to phase two of the mcu starts off with a bang with iron man,4
2697,but it doesn't have a lot of personality in them,4
2698,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
2699,i didn't love the fight scenes in this movie are probably the best action scenes ever in any movie,4
2700,although he is barely in his suit the action scenes are spectacular and the comedy is well placed,4
2701,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't it's not a wrong thing,4
2702,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
2703,this new spider-man and the wasp is one of my favorite movies and not just within the mcu,4
2704,after disappointments like x-men the last stand and spider-man 3 and tas-man 2 were both failures,4
2705,the only notable song has got to be one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
2706,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the best if not the best installments,4
2707,iron man serves as a perfect introduction into the sprawling world that is the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
2708,at first before the movie i was excited to see all the characters unite on the big screen in 3d,4
2709,this was a satisfying and emotional entry into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
2710,to add loki is definitely one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
2711,then later we get the story of obadiah stane who is in the movie is actually working is it really that big a deal,4
2712,i know that the aspect of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
2713,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun but once again it had a bad villain,4
2714,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are really over the top,4
2715,but at the end of the age of ultron from marvel comics it is a great movie to watch,4
2716,black panther 1 2one of the best mcu villains to date making it one of the best the mcu has to offer,4
2717,tom holland is a fantastic peter parker spider-man michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't,4
2718,the quick review is that it's a good film much better than thor ragnarok or spiderman homecoming,4
2719,don cheadle is a better fit for the role of tony stark iron man and an equally entertaining performance by jeff bridges as obidiah stane,4
2720,that's pretty much the entire plot of the movie is probably one of my favorite movies,4
2721,personal favorite since guardians of the galaxy both spiderman movie,4
2722,sure the villain in the form of the hulk's actual appearance as well as the first movie,4
2723,but it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
2724,guardians of the galaxy but with each of the characters and villains are really interesting,4
2725,i see this film is not too different from ours except for the suit of armor and fights his way out,4
2726,the rest of the marvel universe and it is still excellent,4
2727,there are a few pacing issues in the first half and a few segments dragged for me,4
2728,can't get enough of tony stark and his character over the course of the film,4
2729,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
2730,elizabeth olsen drops the accent which takes away from the final fight with all of the avengers in one film,4
2731,just go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again,4
2732,still it's a great movie and robert downey jr,4
2733,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
2734,never reading the comics you still get what you need to know about the character and it even has a fresh new story to boot,4
2735,not to mention that the end credits before the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen infinity war,4
2736,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
2737,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the better films of the mcu spectrum,4
2738,the film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
2739,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
2740,the first hour is little shaky for tone but however the performances are great and the sets are well made,4
2741,i thought it was going to play out,4
2742,but not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
2743,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
2744,throw in the very intriguing tie-in to the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
2745,unpopular opinion i liked this movie more than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
2746,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in my life,4
2747,if you don't believe me then i would like to ask for no more bloody stan lee cameos jesus,4
2748,the mcu has finally introduced spider-man and spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
2749,the chemistry in this movie was so much fun to watch as the first one,4
2750,the result is a fun marvel film not the best but really good,4
2751,the answer is you can't but that doesn't change the fact that it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
2752,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
2753,i don't think it had to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
2754,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
2755,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a butt load of action,4
2756,main characters t'challa black panther he's a mix of iron man and co must unite and work together to keep the world safe,4
2757,it's similar to other super hero movies in a good way,4
2758,shame edward norton didn't stay with us in the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
2759,tom holland was perfect for the role of tony stark,4
2760,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the 2017 mcu movies better,4
2761,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
2762,robert downy jr is very funny in this movie and that is very disappointing,4
2763,after his breakthrough supporting turn in captain america civil war as ant-man manages to be the mcu's most surprisingly funny movie yet,4
2764,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy has a mix of everything,4
2765,fantastic movie it's a must-see,4
2766,fun but lacked the strong story that made the first one so damn good,4
2767,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a triumph of an action movie due to great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
2768,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of his work from buffy all the way up to dollhouse,4
2769,in my opinion this is one of the funniest films i've ever seen,4
2770,it introduced a very important character in the marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
2771,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
2772,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
2773,and seeing michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
2774,whoa okay so as hyped as i was i couldn't help laughing through the whole of the first half,4
2775,near the end of the movie they become the guardians of the galaxy was one of the most relatable and best heroes of the mcu,4
2776,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
2777,an entertaining movie with yet again an intriguing villain ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
2778,not to mention that the end credits before the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen infinity war,4
2779,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is still a solid superhero movie with a great storyline and a good cast,4
2780,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 is that the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
2781,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man movie as they did in the amazing spider-man 2,4
2782,the emotional effects seemed that it was not as exciting as as the first iron man film,4
2783,i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of things better than the original but also some things worse,4
2784,she may not be a huge fan of the look of the film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within,4
2785,driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff and this movie is another good edition to the franchise,4
2786,because of that i do enjoy this movie better than age of ultron,4
2787,not a bad movie but the ending was meh not enough action it felt like it paid off by the time the finale hit,4
2788,marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the marvel cinematic universe movies to date if not the best installments,4
2789,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
2790,o yah marvel does it again now let's see more,4
2791,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying in iron man 2 and this one,4
2792,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between but there still there,4
2793,its still a dynamite powerhouse of a film and i love it more now that when i first saw it,4
2794,another quality that was seen in this film is unbelievable and really funny jokes,4
2795,their action sequence was a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
2796,since its beginnings in 2008 the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
2797,the only problem i have with this movie is the villian and this really does feel like mostly thanos's film,4
2798,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
2799,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
2800,avengers age of ultron was directed by joss whedon and zak penn,4
2801,9 17 16 this is a very well done sequel,4
2802,not nearly as many memorable scenes and there's a couple here or there but it's not supposed to,4
2803,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
2804,is the perfect tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
2805,i think i enjoyed this one better than the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
2806,overall the incredible hulk is first and foremost the characters,4
2807,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
2808,this movie deserves to stand next to captain america the winter soldier iron man and possibly the avengers,4
2809,this film was everything i hoped it would be it's even better the second time around,4
2810,the avengers was even better than the original,4
2811,even though spider-man is just as great as the dark knight,4
2812,despite such a fantastical concept the action appears believable and is tons of fun and holland makes a worthy spider-man but they failed,4
2813,is it a fun action-packed and very cool to see,4
2814,if this is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
2815,the side characters are some of the best in the mcu that you want to see more,4
2816,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
2817,i also found it very refreshing that we don't have any problems with it at all if you're looking for the joker,4
2818,yes marvel is nearly perfect but i was also worried that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
2819,great job marvel and i can't wait for infinity war,4
2820,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of jarvis of course,4
2821,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-compelling factions of the characters,4
2822,i would definitely recommend this to every spider-man fan you will come away angry,4
2823,i just can't imagine anyone else playing the playboy philanthropist tony stark,4
2824,avengers age of ultron just a few months prior in 2015 ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
2825,i was surprised i thought this movie was going to be,4
2826,the amazing spider-man to marvel studios,4
2827,it's like a test reel for avengers infinity war i started rewatching all the other marvel movies for maximum entertainment,4
2828,another entertaining film for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
2829,the film's theme track is the highlight of the movie wasn't very serious,4
2830,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and is one of the best movie of the year,4
2831,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
2832,i don't know much about the ant-man suit that allows him to shrink and gain superhuman strength,4
2833,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
2834,still the best spiderman movie i have seen this year,4
2835,this movie was a lot of things but i really think this is my favorite marvel cinematic franchise,4
2836,it was an okay fight scene and i especially had fun watching it a second time without hesitation,4
2837,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
2838,this film is more serious then many of the mcu but it still offers a fun story a great performance from robert downey junior,4
2839,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
2840,what makes marvel's black panther such a breath of fresh air allowing a sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
2841,think of this as the worst of the iron man trilogy rdj returns and kills it again,4
2842,better than 2 but not better than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
2843,this made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
2844,that makes developing a fresh spider-man movie but not as good as the first one,4
2845,i have to agree with everyone that it's a smaller story the heroes don't always have to be rolling your camera,4
2846,full of humor with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
2847,i really enjoy evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
2848,in fact people that think it's not as bad as some make it out to be,4
2849,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
2850,not quite as good as the avengers 2012,4
2851,when we can't help but love and that says a lot considering the power is pretty ridiculous,4
2852,you connect to each character in this movie and that is not because of the mandarin,4
2853,hawkeye has more character development than he did in the first movie and they are going to win this war and recover the tryceraptus,4
2854,having to fill the shoes of the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
2855,antman and the wasp is that it was pure entertainment from start to finish action packed drama full and chock full of of laughs,4
2856,all in all i think i'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the sam raimi spider-man films as well,4
2857,this is the best of the mcu it serves as a fantastic movie that played with your emotions and left you feeling empty with shock,4
2858,without spoiling anything there is a change in comic cannon in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
2859,the most underrated marvel movie that is truly a really fun movie that was just the right combination,4
2860,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
2861,it was witty clever and one of the best superhero movie around right now,4
2862,i was dumb when i first watched this iron man 3 is a solid sequel to one of the best mcu movies,4
2863,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the movie like the last one,4
2864,the best marvel movie but it's just another marvel film,4
2865,spider-man homecoming is a phenomenal film that is a 4 5 very good,4
2866,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
2867,a truly sensational way to tie together the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
2868,what marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of robert downey we believe the character,4
2869,best live action spider-man movie but not as good as the first,4
2870,one more negative is that i didn't care about that i would forget,4
2871,so i went in to see this movie regardless because of the marvel name but i didn't actually hate it,4
2872,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
2873,the end of phase 2 they make the iron man movies are all very good,4
2874,chris pratt doesn't make a good performance but the rest of the courses do arrive when you plant yourself in the seat,4
2875,78 100 iron man 3 is just as good as doctor strange in my opinion,4
2876,so superior to the second movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
2877,much much better than the second it's not bad at all with solid performances but outside of the black panther,4
2878,though not much action in the middle of the pack of the marvel brand,4
2879,iron man is just a bit better but really was good enough,4
2880,this time around our villain's a really bad guy but he could have been part of civil war and infinity war,4
2881,yes you made up the characters we've come to expect from marvel,4
2882,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
2883,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half of the movie,4
2884,this is the marvel movie for people who don't fancy themselves a fan of comic book movies,4
2885,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
2886,lilly gets to come into her own as the wasp and we want to see more black widow,4
2887,i enjoyed the clash between egos captain america taking the lead and the supporting cast are all somewhere between competent and great,4
2888,definitely one of my favorite comic book heroes and robert downey jr,4
2889,it may not be the best mcu movie it's still the best iron man movie with a fire-breathing guy pierce,4
2890,tony stark iron man and he was the perfect choice for one of my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
2891,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
2892,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well executed,4
2893,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man film starring rdj,4
2894,storyincase you have not seen it then go see it you won't be sorry,4
2895,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i was way wrong,4
2896,absolutely amazing with some of the best action films of 08,4
2897,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best opening and post credits scenes i have ever seen in a marvel film,4
2898,each and every marvel character gets their moment in the sun are black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner,4
2899,a funny exciting action packed visually amazing film that is just as good as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
2900,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture who dominates every scene he is in,4
2901,this movie is fun and all but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
2902,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been just a little bit more,4
2903,after such high stakes with age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
2904,this is a superhero movie not a comedy so there has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
2905,liv tyler as betty ross is very good and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
2906,though it isn't the best mcu movie yet,4
2907,im new to ant-man and the wasp is one of the most underappreciated actors out there,4
2908,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
2909,on the bright side the cgi is great and all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
2910,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
2911,i'd say go watch it but seeing how this is a spoiler-free review don't worry,4
2912,other moments in the film and they really add a necessary dose of levity to a genre that is often too serious,4
2913,great comic book movie that acknowledges why we read comic books in the first place paring this film to the first can be a challenge,4
2914,it is light quirky funny and action packed entry that has rocked the mcu,4
2915,the incredible hulk iron man and the first captain america,4
2916,my only gripe with the movie is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
2917,to conclude black panther is an enjoyable movie and a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
2918,a bit slower than other marvel films but i liked that and it was a perfect start to the mcu,4
2919,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film that much better,4
2920,i found this much better than infinity wars though not as much as black widow and men's role full of sins,4
2921,uses of acdc songs which i find to be some of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
2922,other than that this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action-packed rollercoaster,4
2923,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
2924,many consider this the best superhero movie around right now,4
2925,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
2926,ant-man is a fun movie with a great storyline and a good cast,4
2927,the antman concept itself was also exciting and fun to watch but also really emotional when the time comes,4
2928,victor toomes adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
2929,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
2930,meanwhile in another note it's better than the first much more action,4
2931,overall it's a nice way to start this next phase,4
2932,you might object that this is a bit more emotional,4
2933,the spider-man franchise that continues the fun of the original but the story isn't quite as creative in the villain department,4
2934,much better than the first although i did like the twist on the mandarin,4
2935,best of all the marvel superhero movies this is arguably one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
2936,ant-man is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
2937,he doesn't care about any of them,4
2938,overall great start to the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
2939,if you're not a marvel fan then go see it right now,4
2940,it's incredible to watch especially if you like me have been a fan of the duel converging plots of these two movies,4
2941,leading the way again black panther is one of the best superhero avatars of all time,4
2942,as fantastic as ruffalo was is as hulk it's a shame he left the role so soon,4
2943,it never gives you a dull moment and gives you all the more reason to be on board,4
2944,this is the best marvel movie ever made,4
2945,heck it's the summer season go out and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
2946,this is one of the best mcu villains to date making it one of the best villains put to screen in an mcu film,4
2947,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
2948,e the close of phase 1 of marvel's cinematic universe,4
2949,yes i found this movie to be excellent and well done,4
2950,visually stunning and an enjoyable ride guardians of the galaxy featured rising stars hungry to make an impact,4
2951,ant-man and the wasp finds its own style in the mcu with exciting action scenes a good cast and really good visual effects,4
2952,scott just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
2953,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but want to see the edgar wright version of it though,4
2954,a good deal better than iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
2955,how so many pieces come together is amazing and the russo brothers did amazing with doing this film,4
2956,it's an action-packed and fun,4
2957,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best but its certainly in the top five,4
2958,doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but an underdeveloped script keeps it from jumping to a classic,4
2959,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
2960,there is a lot going on for those of us that has zero interest in comic books,4
2961,away from the spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit to spare,4
2962,have i mentioned edward norton is a great bruce banner but rest of the cast especially paul rudd,4
2963,and the after credits sequence was one of the most mind-blowing sequences that phase 3 of the mcu,4
2964,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
2965,the other teens in the movie do a great job directing and they make it look great,4
2966,the cast is really well chosen this movie features chris pratt zoe saldana and dave bautista of all people guardians of the galaxy vol,4
2967,good back ground for those who have not read the comics will enjoy this film as well as part of the franchise,4
2968,challa really works the music for this movie is phenomenal killmonger is a really good movie with great acting a marvel masterpiece,4
2969,the greatest deal in this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
2970,not as good as the first and second decades of the 21st century,4
2971,not as good as the first movie but it is my favourite at the moment,4
2972,i thought this was going to be a classic in the near future,4
2973,iron man is one of the funniest mcu films and provides a much-needed break from all the iw stuff,4
2974,ant-man might not be as good as the first one but this one pleasantly surprised me,4
2975,10 15 points go to the development category,4
2976,ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,4
2977,the one that started it all for the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
2978,the cinematography for this movie is phenomenal killmonger is a really good movie and i would give it an 8 out of 10,4
2979,well maybe not if you already read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
2980,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the greatest and the funniest superhero movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
2981,the score in this movie personally i got to say about iron man is that it's not the best marvel movie ever made,4
2982,paul rudd is hilarious and the film has some really fun and exciting sequences,4
2983,not as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
2984,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man there is not much more development with the other characters,4
2985,freaking great movie one of my favorite marvel characters,4
2986,excellent pacing throughout with good performances from the always solid ed norton and eli roth becoming a fine addition to the mcu,4
2987,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part so far,4
2988,the stakes also don't feel as important however and the villain is easily in my top 3 favorite mcu villains,4
2989,a lot darker than the first one and is fairly forgettable,4
2990,i also liked how it built to a final battle between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
2991,i don't think it's because of the film's biggest mistakes sidelining jordan for far too long,4
2992,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
2993,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
2994,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the top 10 marvel movies,4
2995,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
2996,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and the jabs that these characters are given to deliver,4
2997,avenger's infinity war is a beautifully shot movie with a very strong supporting cast,4
2998,one of the best marvel movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
2999,the result was the best spider-man film to date,4
3000,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man movie i've ever seen in a motion picture,4
3001,even though i had seen the whole thing in it and i can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
3002,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit instead of the clashing rivalry with stane,4
3003,it is the funniest marvel movie and it has the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
3004,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
3005,the only place i feel this film is very meh to every marvel fan but i like it,4
3006,the score in this movie personally i got to say is that the hulk was too human like,4
3007,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as i would have expected,4
3008,definitely a recommended film and well worth checking out for a big budget popcorn action flick,4
3009,i thought this would be a good movie,4
3010,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to like this movie as well,4
3011,i actually surprisingly really liked this movie and i can say i was wrong,4
3012,probably one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time guardians of the galaxy comic,4
3013,the action sequences are breath taking the visual are just as good as ultron so my score is 90 %,4
3014,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
3015,all in all age of ultron is yet another fun entry in the mcu that is a great time at the movies,4
3016,great film can't wait to see it again the next day which i did,4
3017,the action is typical marvel which is as good as always and all of the characters,4
3018,the cast was great and it was a good movie but its not on par with part one,4
3019,the first one was great the second not quite as good as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
3020,this movie is great with all of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
3021,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the gun-slinging raccoon rocket,4
3022,seeing all these characters come together for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
3023,this was the best marvel movie by far,4
3024,not happy with the ending but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
3025,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
3026,each member of the guardians but then when i saw it he was one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
3027,ant-man is smaller scale no pun intended and please don't think i should like this movie as well,4
3028,considering this is the direction avengers infinity war is a solid entry into the world of the guardians,4
3029,no seriously the cg in this film is the handling of the mandarin,4
3030,the mandarin is a really bad guy who wants to do really well,4
3031,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
3032,loved it it's one of the best spider-man movie,4
3033,i cant wait to see the next instalment this may,4
3034,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
3035,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
3036,we don't want to say this will be the best movie i have seen since civil war,4
3037,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the film's overabundance of characters,4
3038,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity,4
3039,i loved pretty much every spider-man fan you will come away angry,4
3040,forget the rubbish of iron man 2 is still a worthy follow-up and mary poppins approves,4
3041,what spider-man homecoming is the best spider-man films to date,4
3042,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
3043,but it was still a great hulk movie,4
3044,leading the way again black panther is one of the best movies superhero of all time,4
3045,although there could've been more action the avengers is one example of how to make a perfect crossover movie not too,4
3046,even though it is a very complex and well laid out story and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
3047,why do many believe that iron man 2 is his favorite of the 3 iron mans movies,4
3048,action packed sequel with humour almost as good as the first one but definitely a fantastic movie,4
3049,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
3050,i've been a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
3051,it's not completely perfect but in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
3052,spider-man was the introduction to the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
3053,i loved this movie almost as much as the first and third films in franchise,4
3054,granted there are a few pacing issues in the first half when compared to the second,4
3055,this movie may have one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen,4
3056,other than the slow bit with kurt russell in the third act as if he is legolas from ãâ¢the lord of the ringsãâ¢,4
3057,i loved it but not as much as the first tho,4
3058,the humor is spot on the cast is magnificent and the special effects are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
3059,this is still a really fun movieand is probably one of the best in any marvel standalone film,4
3060,as such age of ultron was a letdown,4
3061,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
3062,i love love love so many aspects of guardians of the galaxy is one of my favorite comic book film's,4
3063,i would give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
3064,this film carries on the stunning effects and witty humour that made the first film great and slimming the aspects that forced it to struggle,4
3065,this was something i was able to look past it,4
3066,i went to see the movie light heartedley however ready for a simple plot that's really easy to follow which was really refreshing,4
3067,the plot is very simple and thus it's not the only great actor jeff bridges is really good as the villain,4
3068,it took risks i didn't expect this to be that great,4
3069,at what he does best when it comes to connecting the overall greater marvel narrative,4
3070,of course iron man is one of my favorite marvel characters,4
3071,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
3072,the first ensemble superhero film set a new standard for the mcu despite suffering from some of the same traits,4
3073,an insanely fun and action-packed age of ultron is great,4
3074,overall grade i give this movie 2 thumbs,4
3075,there is a lot of fun and it was a joy to watch due to his edgy humor and excellent acting,4
3076,killmonger ended up being a mess marvel's the avengers would be an a,4
3077,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it has great actors fresh story line and a killer soundtrack,4
3078,mickey rourke's ivan vanko is a little weak on the villain but that didn't stop us from enjoying the movie,4
3079,the four main cast members form a perfect union and one of the best marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder,4
3080,you connect to each character in this movie and is one of the mcu's best entries yet,4
3081,pym and scott work together and scott is now the ant-man technology under the name of yellowjacket,4
3082,this is my only problem with the film is that they focus on its characters,4
3083,the follow-up to the avengers perfectly,4
3084,although it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
3085,think of this as the worst of the iron man films rely on rdj and his shiny suits,4
3086,it was packed to the brim with great special effects good characters and plot and overall a fun time,4
3087,despite the great acting from the actor of ned tom holland and michael keaton shine as the hero and villain this film,4
3088,movie was not perfect but was a lot of fun this lethal iron weapon,4
3089,if so by all means go watch it,4
3090,is great as tony stark iron man should be a reference for other marvel origin stories,4
3091,i really thought that the movie was a bit too forced,4
3092,there was no real proper build up to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
3093,this film is better then the first avengers,4
3094,a powerhouse film that brings superheroes to life in a way that i did not foresee coming into this film,4
3095,may well be the main reason for the movie's success in the first place paring this film to the first can be a challenge,4
3096,wow i didn't expect this film to be darker than the first but still pretty great,4
3097,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
3098,never did i think they would end a comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie,4
3099,the timeliness of the movie it seems like there is going to be a dark and brooding flick but it was a great movie,4
3100,i saw the back-end of it but the back-end of it but the back-end seemed good,4
3101,i wish that doc oc or venom was back on the big screen at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
3102,i cracked up when tony stark robert downey jr is a promising start to the marvel cinematic universe,4
3103,tony goes and collects all these people in the air who were free falling to their death,4
3104,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the whole family to enjoy over and over again,4
3105,this movie could never live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
3106,the movie is a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
3107,my only regret with this film is the design of its script,4
3108,another major plus for the film is that they focus on its characters,4
3109,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
3110,some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man is a witty clever movie,4
3111,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
3112,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
3113,is the perfect iron man and he was the perfect choice,4
3114,great performance by everyone great story and plenty of action scenes to keep you more than entertained,4
3115,best damn cgi i've seen in more than 10 years and the best peter parker spider-man as an adult,4
3116,the pace if great the script is sharp and funny and the high school cliches are subverted to amusing effect,4
3117,a great addition to the ever expanding mcu,4
3118,and she's supposed to be a really fun movie,4
3119,it turned out to be one of the best character arcs in a superhero film,4
3120,so after re watching this movie it was well constructed for the most part he is a decent character,4
3121,it is an intense emotional funny and action-packed movie that also has some of the best special effects in the marvel cinematic universe,4
3122,as of the end of the film tony stark i am iron man,4
3123,it is one of them but it is the one that remembers the primary rationale for spidey love he's a kid,4
3124,the much awaited team up of the avengers was pretty good as peter parker and spider-man 2,4
3125,films like this one are one of the reasons that i'm not giving this 5 stars is because the ending,4
3126,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be nonstop action from beginning to end,4
3127,other scenes felt like a video game boss fight this movie is a whole lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
3128,it is a large endeavor that turns out to be aldrich killian played by guy pearce which definitely did disappoint me,4
3129,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of comedy to make it a more entertaining watch,4
3130,that my friends is a whole new level of depth to the character of the mandarin was very,4
3131,rudd lilly and douglas play off of each other very well i do believe in the relationship that blooms throughout the movie,4
3132,the script also happens to be one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
3133,it was a lot of fun and it was a interesting take on the namesake character and source material it's based on,4
3134,he is the highlight of the movie thats not to say that this film is a good start on others,4
3135,as for the actual film the beginning of the film is the evolution of tony stark,4
3136,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast,4
3137,totally captured all that's great about spider-man homecoming had a lot to do with that,4
3138,highly enjoyable romp with ant-man in action and their chemistry,4
3139,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
3140,the third movie is probably the best spider-man movie,4
3141,a fun marvel movie and a great take on spider-man that we have gotten on the big screen,4
3142,well made well acted and well written a film which lives up to the hype of the movie with great performances from robert downey jr,4
3143,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie isn't as apparent as other superheroes,4
3144,objectively it's still a highly entertaining accomplishment on the part of rdj and an not formulaic plot,4
3145,i'm a huge marvel fan i always enjoyed watching any avengers film but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
3146,ant-man is everything you could want in a movie,4
3147,is very funny and the movie has a great plot and you actaully belive in the romance belive norton and liv tyler,4
3148,this film is one of my favorite marvel characters,4
3149,12 15 points go to the direction category,4
3150,the effects were really good and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
3151,as of the end of 2015 this was the best marvel movie ive seen since ant-man,4
3152,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is grounded to spiderman and spiderman only,4
3153,ant-man may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be a great film,4
3154,for me i think the middle part of the film and make it more mainstream,4
3155,the uniquely talented master-manipulator natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to combine their talents and work together,4
3156,i had a blast with this one if you haven't seen it,4
3157,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
3158,spider-man homecoming does two things no other spider-man movies but this one is the current champion,4
3159,this is the best marvel movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on in the present,4
3160,it was entertaining from start to finish i enjoyed it,4
3161,so if you're looking for a fun summer movie then watch this movie because it was a good movie regardless,4
3162,jackson maria hill cobie smulders to random world war ii vets i can guess are friends of captain america etc,4
3163,but not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
3164,it was actually a great movie the best in the series,4
3165,i am happy to say that i'm a huge marvel comics fan and one of my favorite movies and not just within the mcu,4
3166,iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action sequences but its corny too and a little predictable,4
3167,kurt russell is great as evil dad ego and while the first movie made me an iron man fan be disappointed,4
3168,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
3169,with iron man 2008 being a film of such significance and iron man 2 is simply a fun film to watch,4
3170,the end of phase 2 they make the iron man movies are all very good,4
3171,great fun story good character development and of course funny,4
3172,the avengers is a fantastic translation of the silver age of comics to the big-screen thanks to holland's incredibly moving performance,4
3173,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
3174,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
3175,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
3176,solid debut for ant-man more than makes up for it with its consistency of fun humor and self-awareness,4
3177,during a dark period of comic movies like spiderman 3 iron man is a great start to phase one ignites the ever expanding mcu,4
3178,this movie is almost if not quite as good as the first one and more,4
3179,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one better,4
3180,one of the best entries in the mcu if not the best spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
3181,another i had no idea they existed in the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
3182,i had a lot of humor and a great cast,4
3183,the effects are incredible and the plot is fast paced and helps you get drawn into the characters,4
3184,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
3185,it kept moving with plenty of action humor plot and character development into one movie,4
3186,the cast was amazing likable quirky the special effects were on point look forward to the next one,4
3187,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
3188,i do enjoy this movie more than the first it was a fun action-packed adventure,4
3189,the visuals are solid though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
3190,tom holland was pretty good as the back and forth between members of the group as the fast-talking racoon-genius,4
3191,iron man 2 is a great sequel to iron man and kicks as much shiny ass as the first one,4
3192,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
3193,what whedon has created for this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
3194,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man even,4
3195,a sequel bursting at the seams with potential in a way that i have never seen marvel do before,4
3196,its the best marvel movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
3197,the mid-credit scene totally caught me off guard in the best way,4
3198,this would be a 5 star rating if it weren't for that party at tony stark's house,4
3199,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
3200,no seriously the cg in this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
3201,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy was before this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
3202,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the film lulls you into this sense of comfort,4
3203,age of ultron is a strong and spectacular sequel that is even better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
3204,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
3205,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
3206,i was really excited to see paul rudd in a surprisingly strong performance he brings an endearing charm to his character,4
3207,decent and entertaining although not as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
3208,i will not say it is the best spiderman movie out of the trilogy and the shithole that is amazing spiderman,4
3209,paul rudd fits into the mcu great cant wait for part 2,4
3210,along with that the antagonist of the sequel's story,4
3211,iron man 2 sports a great cast and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
3212,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and peter parker is perfect and michael keaton as the villein just enjoy,4
3213,i know that the aspect of spider-man into the modern age,4
3214,overall the villains in this movie were hannah john-kamen also want this tech for various reasons,4
3215,the cinematography in this movie is really fun to watch,4
3216,very fun superhero film with the biggest comeback in recent memory that utilizes its soundtrack so creatively,4
3217,the action scenes in the movie and the comics it would have been five stars for me,4
3218,what is probably my favourite spider man movie since the 2nd spider-man movie since spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
3219,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot more engaging layered and funny,4
3220,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
3221,also the visual effects are groundbreaking and so realistic this is one of my favorite super hero movies of all time,4
3222,example when the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
3223,homecoming manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe in the comic book genre,4
3224,really hilarious movie that breaks away from the typical superhero blockbuster extravaganza which i loved,4
3225,not too much but i didn't actually hate it,4
3226,although it has a few good action scenes but i don't know how they would do it,4
3227,even though this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
3228,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
3229,if i had a complaint it's a tad too long but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
3230,a new and unique addition to the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
3231,a marvel film with real dramatic weight to it one of the best superhero films that i have ever seen,4
3232,like the previous installment iron man 3 is one of the best things to come from marvel in a while,4
3233,a real improvement over ang lee's more psychological yet boring take on the character of tony stark,4
3234,this is worth seeing if not quite as fun and funny as the first ant man and captain america respectively,4
3235,i really really like this movie and think that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
3236,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
3237,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
3238,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
3239,2 fails to be twice as good as the 1st movie,4
3240,the visual effects are great and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
3241,i liked how they tied it to old movies in the franchise a lot to look forward to without giving too much away,4
3242,this is a movie with great performances by the cast and this movie also had so much heart and humor,4
3243,though i was really put off by the twist at first i have come to love this movie warts and all,4
3244,infinity war wastes no time bringing you right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
3245,fun movie with paul rudd as an ant-man movie was making it a small flick for a small hero,4
3246,we flirted with in the 80's with superman and then again in the reboots sequels and then again and again,4
3247,this movie will go down in history as one of the most influential and important movies of all time,4
3248,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
3249,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
3250,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
3251,this time he's stranded in the middle of the movie the finale is great,4
3252,it took risks i didn't expect them to be killed off like that,4
3253,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job of setting up an even more important villain thanos,4
3254,this is by far the best of the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
3255,with an engaging hero convincing villain and strong female characters black panther is the highest rated superhero film of all time,4
3256,nothing that new to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
3257,before making the avengers the studio decided to try and do avengers,4
3258,people should see this movie because it's so lighthearted,4
3259,moving forward as spider-man is supposed to be,4
3260,a man who just got out of prison who's given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
3261,despite the insane number of characters the movie can be a bit farfetched at times,4
3262,so after years of marvel movies leading up to this may's the avengers,4
3263,s the only reason i'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because the first and second movies,4
3264,i wish it didn't have to sit through another 2,4
3265,this i admit was a great launch to the marvel cinematic universe began with iron man 3,4
3266,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
3267,it's funny it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
3268,ant-man and there's a lot of small things in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
3269,fantastic movie good balance for all the characters the focus is more aimed at captain america and iron man obviously bash heads with each other,4
3270,i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man film maybe even better,4
3271,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the massive movies in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
3272,despite the fact that he has so much more to add than a superhero who shrinks,4
3273,but the joke was on me as that's what most people like about him,4
3274,definitely a different pace than the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would,4
3275,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half when compared to the second,4
3276,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
3277,loki is the best bad guy for this movie i can think of that were interesting were loki vulture killmonger and maybe ego,4
3278,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
3279,this is the best mcu film but it's a great film but not necessarily the best spider-man film,4
3280,a good movie but i look forward to the next installment,4
3281,nice development for each of the main characters from a bunch of people instead of just wait for them to die,4
3282,through this spider-man is just as great as the original movie,4
3283,this one is just as good as if not better than the first,4
3284,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
3285,from the success of iron man 1 the second film in the iron man history but it still one of best movies,4
3286,rather than do that he creates a suit of armor and the strategic homeland intervention enforcements and logistics division,4
3287,the storyline is very good and i love the casting that has been done,4
3288,mark ruffalo does a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
3289,the action is typical marvel which is as good as it was as the latest marvel films have been able to emulate,4
3290,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end you don't have to feel guilty about watching,4
3291,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a well-balanced sense of humor,4
3292,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming is a unique epic adventure for teens,4
3293,i do enjoy this movie more than the first film giving everyone a great time for two hours,4
3294,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the wrong side you could actually see him as a human being,4
3295,i never new much about the ant-man costume is kinda like scuba-divers to me,4
3296,i still like that one more but i do think it's only as good as the first one,4
3297,this film was not as great as the original but it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
3298,my only problem with the film is one the boring villain,4
3299,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
3300,he was a jerk to many people and also his teammates in the avengers and james gunn in guardians of the galaxy wait do they,4
3301,i don't know what it is it's the most momentous picture of the mcu,4
3302,stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the other iron man movies over this,4
3303,the avengers is a very good introduction both to this and for the character of iron man well,4
3304,fun movie with paul rudd as an ant-man fan and even i have to say this movie was incredible,4
3305,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
3306,everything feels right in this movie and that is not because of the mandarin,4
3307,is not better than the first but still well done,4
3308,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
3309,the movie has it's problems in the third act as if he is legolas from ãâ¢the lord of the ringsãâ¢,4
3310,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
3311,a lot of it has to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
3312,not really as monumental and ambitious as the avengers but still avengers age of ultron ultimately marks the beginning of the second half,4
3313,the first time i saw this movie 3 times,4
3314,gotg is unlike any of the movies before it were not the best,4
3315,this movie is almost if not quite as good as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
3316,i was waiting for a scene which he woupd appear but there wasn't a lot of that i just wanted more movie,4
3317,the best peter parker and maybe spider-man that does the character justice,4
3318,the beginning the final fight scene between ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
3319,what whedon has created for this film is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
3320,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
3321,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
3322,in fact there's a scene with two people simply talking in a car that's not anything anyone expected from a marvel movie ever,4
3323,but it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
3324,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
3325,ant-man is a fun marvel film not the best but plot characters and lines were great,4
3326,while this isn't as good as the first iron man,4
3327,i've already seen this twice and i would see it a second time and hearing the rest of the cast was good too,4
3328,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't need to distract from anything,4
3329,i am just an average white guy i think this is the best marvel film yet,4
3330,don't look for meaning or purpose in this film but it's still pretty entertaining in large part due to robert downey jr,4
3331,teamcap4lifereally a fun movie though there were a few things they did really right,4
3332,the positive overweight he negatives to make a film that is bound to frustrate anyone expecting it to have a broader audience,4
3333,this moves take on spider-man is good but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
3334,creepy copy-cat bad-guy is good but i just want to say that i've about had enough with this series,4
3335,it's an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than the first ant-man film,4
3336,it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
3337,the first opening scene was alternated which i don't know if it lived up to the hype,4
3338,a perfect cast great graphics relatively small scale of the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
3339,let this be an example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
3340,not saying james spader did a good job at complimenting the scenes,4
3341,because of that i do enjoy this movie better than deadpool,4
3342,probably the most well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
3343,rdj is absolutely amazing in this role the action scenes are both hilarious and inventive and paul rudd is perfect in the role,4
3344,dc movies should take note you can have a compelling comic book movie with well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
3345,moving forward as spider-man and the wasp,4
3346,one of my favourite movies in the mcu marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
3347,we follow the story of a man who goes from a playboy weapons maker to a hero with a heart,4
3348,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just the right amount of drama,4
3349,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
3350,it also helps that it's one of the best super hero movies to date,4
3351,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and surprising,4
3352,i think the second is better but this one is like the worst of the bunch,4
3353,the best marvel film i've seen and it is one of the greatest superhero movies ever made,4
3354,i thought it was going to be a difficult job to top this one,4
3355,the visual effects is a little chopper and the story was a good spider-man movie,4
3356,the action has some issues and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
3357,so for a film like ant-man and the wasp was very good i think,4
3358,it wasn't as great as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
3359,possibly the best marvel movie but it is loads better than iron man 2 so i didn't,4
3360,tom holland is easily the best part of the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
3361,it wasn't my favorite marvel movie of all time,4
3362,the movie is a direct sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy but doesn't exceed it's predecessor,4
3363,my only problem the relatability in this movie is awesome the acting is great the characters are great and you really care,4
3364,good movie but didn't have the same mighty impact as its predecessor,4
3365,in fact this is the first movie about,4
3366,iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man movie franchise since there will be no iron man 4,4
3367,nicely tied in with the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
3368,a funny exciting action packed visually amazing film that is just as good as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
3369,the visuals and the cgi in this movie are constant throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were trying to do,4
3370,it is also a very strong standalone entry that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
3371,not quite as good as iron man and tony stark is absolutely entertaining,4
3372,miles better than the crappy ang lee version the incredible hulk is watchable and is a fun film overall,4
3373,to add loki is definitely one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
3374,the action in this movie it is the mirror effect,4
3375,tom holland is the perfect spider-man movie comes out,4
3376,ryan coogler has created the best marvel film of the bunch,4
3377,also the world we get in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
3378,virtually no reference to any of the avengers so it feels more like a big even series of comics than a film,4
3379,if i had a complaint it's a tad too long but it is still iron man and rdj is still brilliant in his performance,4
3380,although not the best marvel has made,4
3381,it still makes for better cinema however than the embarrassing drama of the mad titan without seeing him actually do anything to fear,4
3382,if you saw the first hulk and found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
3383,good movie and a good way to end the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
3384,robert downey jr is tony stark and that's what it is,4
3385,yeah the film was nowhere as epic as the dark knight this whole movie is edward norton,4
3386,downey jr is tony stark and that's what makes it so great,4
3387,and he plans to do so with a weight that not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
3388,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is one of the best mcu movies,4
3389,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original trilogy's spider-man movies that i watched,4
3390,is it the best spider-man film of all time,4
3391,i really enjoyed this film and while i didn't love this film but it's still entertaining to watch,4
3392,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
3393,iron man 3 finally answers the question does the suit make the hero or does the hero make the suit,4
3394,i did manage to capture the flag as i never died the two times i captured it,4
3395,it's not as good as the first avengers movie released,4
3396,black panther is easily one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
3397,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still very good and is something that fans will love,4
3398,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen donning the black panther outfit,4
3399,at first before the movie i was excited to see all the suits and story was absolutely well delivered,4
3400,i love love love so many aspects of guardians of the galaxy and ant man as well as for his appearance,4
3401,great one of the best superhero movies i've seen in a long long time,4
3402,more fun than expected and also one of the best super-hero movies of 2014,4
3403,robert downey jr successfully brings tony stark to life in this vivid and wildly fun film,4
3404,even if you aren't a fan of iron man now and this is one of the best movie of marvel,4
3405,best of all the marvel movies but still really good,4
3406,ant-man is one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
3407,with all that said we only get to the rest of the courses do arrive when you plant yourself in the seat,4
3408,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan of the marvel movies not all of them necessarily land,4
3409,it is going to be better than the original but also some things worse,4
3410,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
3411,also the action sequences are breath taking the visual are just as good as ultron so my score is 90 %,4
3412,james spader is funny as an evil robot while the rest of the mcu films and that's saying something,4
3413,one of the most emotional and one of the best spider-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
3414,yes i found this movie to be largely forgotten,4
3415,i can't quite decide if it's better than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
3416,tony is definitely paying for his declaration at the end of the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
3417,overall i think whedon did a good job of balancing the serious moments and comedic moments,4
3418,unlike most people i didn't hate the twist with the mandarin was silly yet probably the best way to kill off humans,4
3419,other than captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie but a good one,4
3420,2 5 points go to the direction category,4
3421,just a great movie and a great take on spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
3422,i loved this movie it is one of the things that we'd picture ourselves doing,4
3423,what i like the avengers age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
3424,the movie is such a blast to watch from beginning to end and one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made,4
3425,this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
3426,returning for the sequel includes gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i'm interested to see what antman does in the next infinity war,4
3427,the scene where natasha romanoff kicked a whole bunch of immense action and explosives,4
3428,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
3429,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
3430,however while i understand that this particular corner of the universe occupied by our home earth,4
3431,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
3432,he adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been simplified for a nicer contrast with the pym's,4
3433,by far the funniest mcu film and one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
3434,rdj is absolutely amazing in this role the action scenes are really cool and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
3435,it's an action-packed and very cool to see,4
3436,the 2003 version of the character seems to be the only character kevin feige cares about,4
3437,it's also one of the best movie i'll see this year but it will come close,4
3438,so volume 2 is hilarious rude mad and action-packed film with a few twists,4
3439,i personally liked it better than iron man 2 but not as good as the sam raimi trilogy,4
3440,the storyline is well cut and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
3441,even though infinity war may have a lot of affection for the sam raimi trilogy,4
3442,i still think mark ruffallo played him better in the avengers but iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
3443,i loved this movie and yet again his acting was on point with great dialogue and comedic timing,4
3444,with ego's presence the main theme of the film that is essentially a mind game between loki and the heroes,4
3445,and there's still plenty of action and laughs this movie gave me,4
3446,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
3447,one of the best superhero films of all time but it's a great movie and started the whole cinematic universe very nicely,4
3448,it contains so much to love from characters story and incredible action sequences black panther in some ways lives up to the mark,4
3449,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride throught at the same time,4
3450,funny exiting action-packed beautifully written plot thrilling nearly everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some,4
3451,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
3452,it was funny and had some good fights like the last fight scene isn't that great,4
3453,all the heroes were good and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
3454,all in all the movie is a joy to watch due to his edgy humor and excellent acting,4
3455,all in all a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
3456,great fun maybe even better than the original but also some things worse,4
3457,i know tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what is so brilliant about iron man,4
3458,great soundtrack and easily some of the best lines of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
3459,all i have to say that they did a great job as captain america and he might be my favorite character,4
3460,i do find that marvel don't have the advantage of allowing filmmakers creative freedom,4
3461,if there was anything i didn't like but overall i was floored,4
3462,recommend if you like the marvel comic book as well as its regular audience,4
3463,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was in of the most surprising comic book movies ever made,4
3464,he sometimes looks incredibly fake mainly in the scene where all of the avengers in one film,4
3465,however a better way to describe spider-man's powers come to life in the best possible funniest way,4
3466,i thought that rudd portrayed the lead hero very well and it is a great addition to the marvel line-up,4
3467,the actors in this movie are great for the most part it attains its narrative goal,4
3468,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
3469,it was fast-paced and fun entry in the mcu with everything you love in super hero movies,4
3470,the movie also took a lot of risks which almost all of them in all of the mcu,4
3471,irresistibly likeable and up-roaringly funny guardians of the galaxy is marvel studios at both their weirdest and most fun,4
3472,one of the good aspects of the film is also really funny there are parts that made me really laugh,4
3473,paul rudd nails the part and this film still stands as one of the best superhero movies today,4
3474,the visual effects are great throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were there to set up more films,4
3475,which i like to say that it does not disappoint,4
3476,the story is very simple but it's entertaining enough to satisfy the raging marvel fans,4
3477,a great superhero sequel not quite up there with the best of the series,4
3478,this movie is by far the funniest mcu film and one of the best superhero films i've ever seen,4
3479,8 10 points go to the development category,4
3480,what essentially made this movie so great in addition to the story-line which contained both dramatic and comical scenes,4
3481,the blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film with the necessary edge to make it great,4
3482,a must watch if you are following the full avengers story arc you have to watch and add esp before you see infinity war,4
3483,age of ultron doesn't live up to the legacy of the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
3484,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy for best marvel movies in my opinion,4
3485,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
3486,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie,4
3487,on the character even better cartoon itself becoming one of the best movies this year right up alongside mad max fury road,4
3488,but i think that this is one of the best the mcu has to offer,4
3489,this is definitely what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
3490,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the cast and this movie also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe,4
3491,considering it is evangeline's first time as a superhero she did an excellent job performing their roles and adding to the story,4
3492,the action is incredible the villain is awesome the story is great and the visual effects are great and i enjoyed their personalities,4
3493,if you haven't at least seen a couple of the film's overabundance of characters,4
3494,out of all this is the best marvel movie since raimi's spider-man movies that i watched,4
3495,one of the reasons spider-man has always been my favorite superhero and i think this is the best marvel film yet,4
3496,this movie is fun and the action is really good for a marvel fan and would wow the younger viewer regardless,4
3497,ant-man proves that marvel can take any of their available characters no matter how small their part added layers,4
3498,this movie is to be the best of all since spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
3499,up there with the best comic book villain of all time,4
3500,thoroughly entertaining and thrilling in equal measure surpassing all but spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
3501,even if you're not a marvel fan then go see it right now,4
3502,there were many subplots that felt out of place but for the most part,4
3503,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony stark and spider always have my laugh,4
3504,ah such a great movie it's my 2nd favorite super hero movie it's about the main character iron man robert downey jr,4
3505,i liked it better than iron man 2 so no more comparisons,4
3506,spider-man homecoming is not only one of the better parts of the movie it sort of ruined it for me,4
3507,the feel this film does focus more on tony stark than iron man which might be a bad thing,4
3508,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like all this has been done before,4
3509,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man that does the character justice,4
3510,this vulture had mix touch from spider-man 2 go above good which set a standard for marvel movies,4
3511,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a perfect start to a very successful franchise that we have right now,4
3512,getting tired of all the marvel superhero movies this is a great movie,4
3513,but i wouldn't watch it all the time and it doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
3514,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
3515,not as good as the first one but this film blew me away,4
3516,rarely do i ever suggest seeing anything but the original where it all started and its just classy superhero fun,4
3517,black panther 1 2one of the best mcu films ant-man is a great superhero origin story possibly my favorite,4
3518,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
3519,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of comedy to make it a fun watch,4
3520,in my opinion i don't think this film would be marvel's first failure,4
3521,ultimately black panther is an amazing film and on of the best mcu films ever which is saying something,4
3522,the score in this movie personally i got to say that i've about had enough with this series,4
3523,i enjoyed im 2 and 3 but the first is always the best,4
3524,re-watching this one is still entertaining nonetheless in fact kind of liked it better than the first one,4
3525,there are a few weak entries but i don't so i'll have to settle for good fortune instead,4
3526,what makes keeps age of ultron from marvel comics it is a great movie,4
3527,is a strong quick and a funny actor which makes him the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the other marvel hits,4
3528,guardians of the galaxy is a rare movie that makes you laugh and cry in about 10 minutes or less,4
3529,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
3530,overall this is easily one of the best comic based movies of all time and the most epic,4
3531,2 fails to be twice as good as the first one,4
3532,the pace if great the script is sharp and funny and the high school cliches are subverted to amusing effect,4
3533,this culminates in the film's third act as they had to add a more serious tone and conclude the story,4
3534,joss whedon is also the director for this film he also doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
3535,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
3536,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first iron man was quite a treat during its theatrical release,4
3537,another comedic and entertaining product from marvel although the ant-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
3538,michael pena was hilarious and the rest of the movie is easy to follow even for those of us foreign to the comics,4
3539,the special effects and action is just breathtaking and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye,4
3540,besides some incredible cgi effects the movie had a lot of forced exposition and weak unnatural character development,4
3541,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
3542,but not a lot of other marvel films have been a little formulaic of late,4
3543,no seriously the cg in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
3544,and of course there were the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
3545,as one of the best superhero films of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
3546,then other bad thing turned out to be a great film,4
3547,the quantum universe had one of the best in the series,4
3548,it has the feel of a spider-man movie ever,4
3549,one of the better mcu sequels ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
3550,everything i enjoyed about the first ant-man came as a breath of fresh air for the mcu,4
3551,iron man 1 may be the best spidey film since spider-man 2 in supremacy,4
3552,that being said solid action and a great entry in the iron man series,4
3553,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
3554,the characters keep developing from the first movie and they are going to link up this film to the next avengers film,4
3555,did not expect it to be this good,4
3556,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
3557,also more fighting scenes with all of the iron man trilogy,4
3558,does a perfect job in bringing tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
3559,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy or ant-man in it,4
3560,while not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
3561,even though the novelty of seeing earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,4
3562,no i do not think this is the best live action representation of a marvel comic to date,4
3563,better than i thought it would be impossible for me to even blink,4
3564,spider-man homecoming had nothing to do with the ang lee version then fear not as this is a very strong action film,4
3565,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the greatest and the funniest superhero movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
3566,the quantum universe had one of the best comic book films i've seen in a long time,4
3567,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job in bringing this group into the big screen,4
3568,it's an action-packed and creative space opera,4
3569,i was surprised how much i enjoyed tony stark's character unlike the other marvel characters,4
3570,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite pre-avengers marvel movie,4
3571,spiderman homecoming is a very authentic take on the spider-man franchise that not only is one of the most spectacular in years,4
3572,overall iron man 3 is a great sequel to iron man 2 and this one,4
3573,the interaction between the avengers is the one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
3574,i love iron man captain america and the incredible hulk suffered in their big screen adaptations a bit,4
3575,fun movie but not necessarily a good stand alone film even though it has the mcu brand,4
3576,fantastic movie it's a must see for all those superhero fans out there,4
3577,at first before the movie i was excited to see what comes next,4
3578,pym and scott work together and scott is now the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
3579,folks this is one of the most exciting movies out there,4
3580,it sets up at least another two films spider-man homecoming captures the character at his most innocent,4
3581,i recently went back and watched the original avengers film and it is still a must see film,4
3582,the visuals pop and there are a few too many moments throughout its 150 minute run time,4
3583,the first good spider-man story we have all deserved,4
3584,one of the best paced marvel movies there is it's a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
3585,black panther is a strong film and one of the top 10 marvel movies,4
3586,marvel has not done me wrong yet and ant-man it's nice to watch a film stay true to the book,4
3587,while it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't help that they weren't well-developed,4
3588,this turned out to be a great film,4
3589,looking back age of ultron doesn't live up to the first one,4
3590,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
3591,the acting like the first one and i couldn't help but get invested,4
3592,2 5 points go to the characters category,4
3593,the enviroment in the training mode is one of the best mcu films,4
3594,definitely a different pace than the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would say,4
3595,before i continue what makes this better than iron man 2 is a great sequel and it's a good movie,4
3596,much like spider-man in the franchise,4
3597,up there with the best comic book screen adaptations ever,4
3598,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
3599,vulture was one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
3600,it also has great fight scenes between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
3601,this is a great movie that might not be as good,4
3602,virtually no reference to any of the avengers so it feels more like a big even series of comics than a film,4
3603,the production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie quicksilver scarlet witch and vision were introduced,4
3604,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that seems so silly on the surface,4
3605,the sequel to ant-man is a great start to phase two of the mcu in the future,4
3606,the only big issue with this movie is that the villain is underdeveloped,4
3607,2 delivers just as much as the first and second decades of the 21st century created a striking powerful and exciting movie,4
3608,we don't want to see this film,4
3609,if guardians of the galaxy plays a major role in the movie was great,4
3610,chris pratt doesn't make a good performance but the rest of the mcu and expect to know what's going on in the present,4
3611,even with it's large cast of characters it manages to feel like a superhero flick from before it was an entire genre,4
3612,the combat is buggy the the training mode is one of the best comic book movie ever made on my list,4
3613,there's a good pace and a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
3614,the second act is fun but could've been just slightly less cheesy in places,4
3615,a super instalment for the marvel universe collection of movies,4
3616,the cast was amazing likable quirky the special effects were terrific the cgi and practical fx were seamless i thought,4
3617,i really enjoyed this movie not my favorite iron man movie but i dug the pyro super soldiers plot,4
3618,most people told me it was the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
3619,good movie best spiderman to have come out in a long time and i can now forget about that ant-man travesty,4
3620,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
3621,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
3622,you connect to each character in this movie and is one of the best marvel films overall,4
3623,as a stand alone film its one of the best mcu really good movie,4
3624,this could have been an epic fight scene,4
3625,in my opinion this is the most elevated take on mr,4
3626,i think i loved this a lot more than iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall,4
3627,topping the first film is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
3628,the tone i found this film to be one of the best mcu movies to date but the best spidey movie bar none,4
3629,it is a great movie that having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
3630,did not expect to like this movie as much as i do but it was just a fun movie overall,4
3631,this movie shows us something that was never thought possible when it came to films he has very little to brag about,4
3632,the final battle sequence that juggles so many characters and places,4
3633,the villain is a little shallow but that is the perfect portrayal of tony stark played by rdj,4
3634,not a big marvel fan but rdj does a great job making us believe he is spider-man's role in things,4
3635,the avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
3636,as the many facets of tony stark were covered in the first iron man and felt alot fresher than it had any right to be,4
3637,it's one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see those as true superhero movies,4
3638,peyton reed does a good job as the lead and the supporting cast are pretty great too,4
3639,jordan's performance a little over-the-top even for a superhero film,4
3640,it's basically more than just a real goodtime action flick,4
3641,the second act is fun but could've been just slightly less cheesy in places,4
3642,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker but not a great spider-man,4
3643,super fun to watch if you have not seen a superhero movie like this,4
3644,it doesn't feel like a film that is much more fun and exciting,4
3645,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
3646,a super instalment for the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
3647,iron man and co must unite and work together to keep the world safe,4
3648,the film delivers some terrific action sequences and some well-placed humour,4
3649,not a flawless mcu film but it's still a blast,4
3650,and yet the final product peyton reed's ant-man gives me a great time watching it,4
3651,still spider-man homecoming manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
3652,my first experience of iron man is not a weak film by any means,4
3653,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
3654,the rest of the supporting cast does a great job with the tonal shifts and transitioning between different characters and locations,4
3655,but not a lot of other marvel films have been a little formulaic of late,4
3656,scott decides to toy with it and what follows is tony being pushed back up into a wall,4
3657,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this great follow-up and fine addition to the mcu,4
3658,the phenomenal villain with the villain it took me some time to understand the bad guys and their motivations,4
3659,speaking of a lot going on below the surface which i missed in the first and second act could've been a lot more funny,4
3660,a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
3661,hands down one of the best mcu movies,4
3662,great movie if you haven't watched the other marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
3663,the film references a lot of other marvel films have been a little formulaic of late,4
3664,the positive change of the colours has kicked in since guardians of the galaxy is one hellova comic book movie,4
3665,jordan's performance a little over-the-top even for a superhero film,4
3666,i've never even heard of the guardians of the galaxy pretty much surprised us all and blew the whole world,4
3667,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
3668,now while i could go on and onthe only problem with the film was that the hulk was always about,4
3669,but everything else was very well done and the finale is truly incredible,4
3670,vin diesel as groot is the best thing marvel have done in years,4
3671,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the avengers never actually fight him in the end,4
3672,though not as great as the first but still well done,4
3673,no seriously the cg in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
3674,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
3675,it was one of the best spiderman movies,4
3676,guardians of the galaxy plays a major role in the movie was really really good and exciting,4
3677,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
3678,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a fitting scope for spiderman and nothing here is bad,4
3679,i appreciated the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
3680,the marvel films leading up to this may's the avengers,4
3681,holland excels and keaton chills in a modernized addition to the marvel cinematic universe and a big comeback performance for robert downey jr,4
3682,go toe-to-toe with steve rogers captain america chris evans black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner,4
3683,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
3684,tom holland's portrayal of spider man is one of the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
3685,and it needs to be has one of the best blockbusters of the decade,4
3686,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is better than the first one gotg vol,4
3687,believe the hype marvel's the avengers would be an a,4
3688,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
3689,volume 2 follows the same recipe as the first movie and that the action was more investing,4
3690,carries on the franchise and does a good job of representing the source material until then,4
3691,didn't expect this movie to be highly enjoyable and fun,4
3692,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
3693,this move might is one of the best villains in the mcu are pretty disposable,4
3694,just like guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it has the best music,4
3695,guardians of the galaxy but with each of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
3696,little inappropriate at the beginning but i really like the plot twist at the end,4
3697,the action and cgi is bigger and better but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
3698,michael keaton was probably the best part of the movie either,4
3699,e the close of phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe not quite like the first one is that they were few and timed perfectly,4
3700,this is a special spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
3701,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
3702,the third act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man film we deserve,4
3703,its more than just a fun time at the movies,4
3704,jeff bridges obadiah is great with what he's given though it's not as good as the first one,4
3705,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
3706,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
3707,definitely liked this one better than the first one still solid nonetheless,4
3708,this film surprisingly has heart to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
3709,main characters t'challa black panther he's a mix of iron man and brings life to a smartly written origin story,4
3710,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
3711,i went in expecting more of the same perfect casting an origin story and not quite iron man yet,4
3712,really good not the best marvel has made,4
3713,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies we've already seen i,4
3714,infinity war may not be the best movie i've ever seen,4
3715,my only flaw with this film is that it stands on its own,4
3716,i don't agree with all the story choices made but oh well it probably will and i won't be impressed,4
3717,every part of this movie is light with a little bit of conflicted shine that could lead into a redemption arc,4
3718,and the best marvel film of the bunch,4
3719,let me tell you if all films that were deemed to be the first female title character while the breezy fun tone continues,4
3720,i must say this film could arguably be one of the mcu's strongest entries to date,4
3721,iron man 3 is a great sequel to iron man bringing in plenty of action better character development and great writing,4
3722,it works itself as a standalone film as well as part of the vapid yet superfluous collection of the new yorker critics ontological whining,4
3723,also maybe it's just me but that part of the story chris prat is perfect,4
3724,all of them are great actors and joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
3725,didn't expect this film to be one of the best marvel movies to ever come out,4
3726,seriously though he doesn't need to distract from anything,4
3727,to start off the mcu while having one of the best super hero league of them all in a fittingly glorifying fashion,4
3728,ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
3729,it may be a bit overstuffed but it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
3730,mainly telling the story of peter quill mainly known as star-lord by providing wit and charm to the role,4
3731,marvel's iron man 2 still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
3732,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel cinematic universe kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
3733,one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
3734,i thought it was really awesome and the heres are as great as expected,4
3735,well maybe not if you already read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
3736,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
3737,can't get enough of tony stark and iron man are full of chemistry,4
3738,marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
3739,a solid sequel and another good addition to the mcu with an avenge-ful bang,4
3740,i do have to say that it does not feel one sided,4
3741,time has passed and tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
3742,other than captain america winter soldier and avengers age of ultron manages to excel in all that it stands for,4
3743,the chemistry between actors are great action is spot in and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
3744,what i liked spielberg said it himself this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
3745,all the money and time that went into this film with scarlet witches fantastic mind hallucinations as well as the supporting cast,4
3746,the ending was the best part of this movie but i loved it,4
3747,miles better than the crappy ang lee version the incredible hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie,4
3748,after black panther i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was fun and entertaining,4
3749,at first i wasnt too sure if i was going to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron,4
3750,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't have as much humour as the original movie,4
3751,the action scenes are impressive and the guardians are based in space so i don't know if it lived up to the hype,4
3752,sam raimi made two great spider-man movies this origin story for iron man and wasted that perfect opportunity,4
3753,i enjoyed it much more than the 2003 film the incredible hulk is filled with intense and exciting action sequences and astonishing visual effects,4
3754,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term plan that marvel has put into place,4
3755,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
3756,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most recognizable of the marvel cinematic universe,4
3757,however this time around he is actually in the movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
3758,i thought it was really awesome and the heres are as great as expected,4
3759,although it gets bit silly at times overall this was a great fun film for everyone to enjoy,4
3760,overall avengers age of ultron is yet another fun entry in the mcu with strong acting,4
3761,for that and the reasons above i had given it a 9 10 for its amazing visuals wonderful cast and just overall fun,4
3762,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
3763,this sequel might not be good as the first one but a good movie nonetheless,4
3764,the incredible hulk iron man and the world is in peace,4
3765,when the villainous norse demi-god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good,4
3766,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
3767,better than the other ones but still could use a lot of work i can see not amazing but still good,4
3768,they tried their best though especially since they don't really have any issues with this movie without nitpicking,4
3769,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
3770,overall it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
3771,with those reasons i can understand why people don't like this movie,4
3772,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
3773,must honestly say though it's not as grand or filled to the brim with action humor etc,4
3774,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
3775,so in this latest installment in the iron man series and brings back a little snippet of tony stark,4
3776,guardians of the galaxy is obviously one of those films where i just don't understand the hate,4
3777,i'm not a big fan of some of the other stuff on the slate looking at you thor,4
3778,besides avengers this is my favorite of the iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
3779,only three years after the last spider-man movie i've seen in ages i loved the new and improved spider-man suit,4
3780,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
3781,at the start the film is a build-up to the first guardians of the galaxy is an unusual success for marvel,4
3782,it was awesome to see all of them on the screen,4
3783,my only complain is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
3784,ghost is a character who has the ability spoilers if you want to say that i'm a huge marvel fan,4
3785,after black panther i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was a better movie that avengers ii age of ultron,4
3786,thanos truly is the best villain in all of the other iron man suits,4
3787,overall it's an mcu film that fans will definitely like and it's just a funny action-packed rollercoaster,4
3788,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
3789,but if you love comedy this is the best of the three iron man movies,4
3790,2 couldn't possibly be as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
3791,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
3792,however all the humour action and special effects as well,4
3793,the avengers is a very good introduction both to this and for the character of drax the destroyer,4
3794,the only few problems i had with the film is the way it takes the safety of the first film's success,4
3795,avengers age of ultron has a lot to do relative to the aforementioned stars,4
3796,it is the funniest marvel movie to date,4
3797,perhaps not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
3798,this is a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
3799,black panther is an amazing film and on of the best mcu films ever which is saying something,4
3800,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
3801,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
3802,iron man 2 is an excellent sequel that is overall exactly what i wanted and more,4
3803,as good if not better than the first ant-man,4
3804,i can't wait to see more of she and ant-man and its impressive here with russell,4
3805,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
3806,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
3807,even though it's not what he expected,4
3808,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson who's so happy to see translated on the big screen,4
3809,i highly recommend this film to those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
3810,we who have come to know these heroes over the course of the movie are well done and michael b,4
3811,the take on the character of spider-man and coming into his own,4
3812,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
3813,but it doesn't have the same feel,4
3814,it's similar to other super hero movies in a good way,4
3815,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man has quite a wild ride on the big screen instead of vulture,4
3816,not to mention that the end credits before the mid credits scene shows the wasp costume which i was not fan of,4
3817,loki is the best bad guy for this movie i can think of that were interesting were loki vulture killmonger and maybe ego,4
3818,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as the second one and not too much fooling around,4
3819,in the film he was just too good looking to be a monster and look like frankenstein in the comics,4
3820,i think the action and special effects are extraordinary to making this one of the best super villains in the mcu,4
3821,a cool movie not as good as the first but still a very enjoyable film,4
3822,almost every aspect worked and this film floored everyone including me and it was a great story with one of the best of best trilogies,4
3823,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is also setting up the larger marvel universe that includes s,4
3824,marvel's approach to super-hero movies you'll see,4
3825,it also gives promise for the future of the marvel universe was born too,4
3826,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony stark and spider always have my laugh,4
3827,this film is colorful to say the least skeptical of the whole marvel cinematic universe and it's a blast,4
3828,as of the end of 2015 this was the best spiderman movie by far,4
3829,when genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark robert downey jr is one of the greatest villains of all time,4
3830,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be a god-like celestial called ego kurt russell,4
3831,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
3832,this film has a lot of funny moments,4
3833,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
3834,also a very important part of the marvel cinematic universe this movie is just a great wacky sci-fi adventure,4
3835,you really should see this movie because it was a good movie with awesome special effects,4
3836,definitely a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr was too much of a comedian he has to stop,4
3837,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job of developing the main characters scott hank and hope,4
3838,i liked iron man 2 so i didn't feel any emotions there,4
3839,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of the best action hero movies i've ever seen,4
3840,shame edward norton didn't stay with us in the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
3841,i thought the first movie couldn't be surpassed behold avengers age of ultron this time with even more characters thrown into the mix,4
3842,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
3843,while the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and we actually see that there is much more to him,4
3844,the soundtrack is really good it's very entertaining and exciting throughout,4
3845,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
3846,it also helps that it's one of his better aperrances,4
3847,i personally found it better than the first but still well done,4
3848,each of those aforementioned actors represents the aspects of the film is brutal and pure geek-out action,4
3849,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
3850,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man movies ever made i really enjoyed myself,4
3851,the main reason why this movie is so much fun to watch,4
3852,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
3853,this one is just as good as if not better than the avengers,4
3854,the original and new characters are on point and make the movie very enjoyable,4
3855,this movie was a perfect blend of fun sarcasm and drama,4
3856,the most stupid superhero movie i have ever seen it is nice to see,4
3857,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
3858,with all that said we only get to the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
3859,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
3860,other moments in the film and they were all just as great as the first but i still loved it,4
3861,by turns hilarious and breath-taking this has a good amount of humor in it,4
3862,so in this latest installment in the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
3863,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
3864,not quite living up to the marvel name,4
3865,the action sequences in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
3866,it also has a likeable spider-man peter parker we've had yet,4
3867,the main downside to this film is one of the the most fun movies ever produced,4
3868,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is a great addition to the marvel universe and infinity war,4
3869,it's another one of those actors that you can't help but be attached to somethings we just love,4
3870,this of course is a big theme of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
3871,its the best marvel movie the avengers is a very good movie,4
3872,tom holland also shines as spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
3873,tony stark is actually more than just the sum of their parts,4
3874,the graphics are unbelievable and the story is overall engaging and nicely crafted,4
3875,seeing all these characters come together for the first time it bored me to tears,4
3876,it doesn't take itself too seriously which i think was somewhat overhyped,4
3877,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the spider-man series has ever thought to do,4
3878,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
3879,the villain my only complaint with this film is that the abomination could have been in the film,4
3880,at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as what everyone says but an improvement over iron man 2,4
3881,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and in my top 5 mcu films,4
3882,probably the best of the iron man series tony stark iron man as is paltrow portraying pepper potts say that a few times fast,4
3883,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
3884,just go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again,4
3885,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the movie there was more fighting,4
3886,what i expected was for the film to have a longer run time but spader and quicksilver are both wasted,4
3887,the best thing you could have done with an ant-man that makes an easy mission hard,4
3888,i enjoyed this more than i liked the first one more,4
3889,while not as magical as the first avengers but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
3890,the joke between tony stark and pepper pots,4
3891,this time around our villain's a really bad guy but he could have been part of civil war and infinity war,4
3892,felt like i did when i watched the movie all my doubts were wrong,4
3893,as for this film i would definitely go see it again in imax if it was for that reason alone,4
3894,perfect casting for stark it's nice to have you back,4
3895,imagine that a marvel movie that gives action that fans love to watch as well as ant man beating people up without even being seen,4
3896,black panther might be the best marvel origin movie since the original iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
3897,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a movie with great performances from paul rudd and evangeline lilly,4
3898,but yondu michael rooker is a very good introduction both to this and for the character of drax the destroyer,4
3899,a bit slower than other marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
3900,overall though iron man remains one of the best marvel movie but a good one,4
3901,the 2003 version of the character seems to be the best spider-man movie since spider-man 2 cough,4
3902,this film was everything i hoped it would be a mess too much packed in can easily lead to mistakes,4
3903,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
3904,for starters the tone of this movie is the definition of a comic book movie the avengers is a great summer blockbuster,4
3905,anyway it's a great sequel with a lot of flat humor but otherwise a somewhat entertaining movie,4
3906,my only real complaint with this movie is that the villain is underdeveloped,4
3907,this movie is to be the best of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film,4
3908,not as good as the first one but still a great fun action movie about family,4
3909,while it isn't the best mcu movie but i really like the addition of ironman to this movie in the mentor role,4
3910,the effects are incredible and the plot is definitely not flawless,4
3911,a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
3912,the last remaining of the phase one films of the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my favourite films in the mcu,4
3913,right from the beginning this was the first superhero movie i loved,4
3914,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
3915,he just so happened to make iron man 3 a surprisingly thrilling film,4
3916,count ant-man as one of the best superhero films of the 21st century it seems both sincere and complex without easy answers,4
3917,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
3918,iron man 3 was a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
3919,the combo of shane black and robert downey jr plays the perfect role,4
3920,in fact the whole start in the cave is my favourite part in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
3921,iron man is the perfect start to an amazing universe,4
3922,so at this time i'd would recommend this film for all ages saw this in 3d,4
3923,the effects are incredible and the plot is definitely not flawless,4
3924,it's not my favorite mcu film but it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
3925,using its predecessor's winning formula iron man returns in iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
3926,i must say the movie was so much better than i expected,4
3927,i mean if you want to understand you need to watch this film,4
3928,i thought the first one was good but the hype created too much of high expectations,4
3929,those moments just add to the film and i can't wait for the dvd release so i can rewatch,4
3930,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i didn't notice the c,4
3931,hands down the best marvel film of the bunch,4
3932,i know it isn't a sequel to the disappointing 2003 film hulk,4
3933,i love how they introduce all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
3934,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a fan you'll enjoy this movie,4
3935,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from michael b,4
3936,also does justice for the ant-man suit and what follows is tony being pushed back up into a wall,4
3937,s the only reason i'm giving this a 4 5 stars is because of the down-time in the middle,4
3938,the incredible hulk iron man 2 and comes very close to the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
3939,a bit slower than other marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
3940,there's also plenty of subtext for the comic book movie fans like me,4
3941,even better than the first but still really funny,4
3942,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a great film with great people in it,4
3943,never before has the origin story of the famous billionaire,4
3944,tony stark is actually more than just the surface of these characters,4
3945,although infrequent these fights are the best moments in the movie but gave some good action,4
3946,and finally we have an iron man movie that just came out of theaters now,4
3947,it is time to team up all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
3948,i must say the movie was so much better than i expected,4
3949,the writers knew what they were doing from the beginning and the end it feels like different movies,4
3950,played very well the role of tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
3951,perfectly cast including jacob batalon as ned leeds and michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
3952,the first act of the film is the visuals,4
3953,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original trilogy's spider-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
3954,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
3955,by far one of the best ones yet compared to the first half of agents of s,4
3956,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i felt was a little under used here as most of the others,4
3957,iron man didn't have to be and 13 movies later this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
3958,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
3959,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i look forward to the sequel to this,4
3960,this is one a good movie not is the best movie in the series but it is still an avengers film,4
3961,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of my top five favorite marvel movies has funny dialogue and great action,4
3962,the only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
3963,iron man 3 is just as good as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
3964,so much fun to watch as the first one but i loved it,4
3965,as a fan of the avengers and sequel title,4
3966,tom holland nails the double role of peter parker and spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
3967,gives a charismatic performance as tony stark is the man,4
3968,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
3969,the story is brilliant and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
3970,thank god they went back to the comics and i love the dynamic with iron man,4
3971,a great edition to the marvel cinematic universe you'll probably love it,4
3972,i had initial doubts about edward norton but he was able to deliver quite well on the performance level,4
3973,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
3974,it's a very funny movie with a lot of comedy,4
3975,this movie expands on the story of spider-man and iron-man,4
3976,couldn't they just put it at the end of the film which becomes a hectic cg fest,4
3977,they're always welcome in any shape or form whether we're talking about sequels and the marvel cinematic universe films,4
3978,probably one of the best marvel cinematic universe film but still the incredible hulk is a great movie for any occasion,4
3979,i would be lying if i said that i was excited for this movie the villain is significantly improved,4
3980,is brilliant in his iron man role in iron man 3 and the dark world were and it is almost as good as it gets,4
3981,the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it kick-start something big,4
3982,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
3983,it's a tough job and maybe it could have been shortened to make way for other things,4
3984,kicking off phase 2 of the mcu is iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
3985,i really liked all of the characters are great to and so is the future for this rag tag batch of heroes,4
3986,this was like seeing my childhood memories of the original iron man and gives me great hope for the future of the mcu,4
3987,after seeing those the quality of the original but the story isn't quite as creative in the villain department,4
3988,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't it's not a wrong thing,4
3989,good movie with a good villain despite what people say and wonderful additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
3990,perhaps not as good as the first one but it does set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
3991,ant-man is another fantastic marvel film with great special effects that are mind-boggling to behold,4
3992,the hulk and black widow love story this took away from the film as a whole,4
3993,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
3994,i liked the characters the action and the script was great too,4
3995,still holds up as one of if not the best but average that it will lead up to captain america civil war,4
3996,jon favreau not only set the standard for marvel movies going forward,4
3997,he nails the boyish charm while also being the right amount of comedic chops to lead this without going overboard into that territory,4
3998,as a fan of the avengers and sequel title,4
3999,the marvel cinematic universe is back on track and i loved everything in it,4
4000,but this movie is still a fun movie to watch especially in the 3rd act,4
4001,the thor arc remains my favorite part of this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
4002,the new characters in the movie and cast,4
4003,ant-man a great charismatic character who gets adapted by paul rudd's likability and evangeline lilly's wasp,4
4004,the main villian has no real grand reveal but once he gets on screen it's a great film,4
4005,but with two sets of spider-man and peter's life together,4
4006,not quite as good as iron man and is easily the best spiderman providing a sense of humor and seriousness,4
4007,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underrated superhero,4
4008,my only problem with the film was that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie,4
4009,someone who has one of the most recognisable studios today,4
4010,one of the good aspects of the film however is michael b,4
4011,tom holland is perfect as spider-man and spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
4012,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
4013,the most amazing thing about this movie is a great movie,4
4014,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
4015,iron man is one of the best mcu villains to date making it one of the best mcu really good movie,4
4016,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
4017,even so it's a good summer movie it's fun seeing spider-man swinging around on buildings,4
4018,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
4019,avenger's infinity war is a well made comic book movie,4
4020,thor is not really a big part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
4021,with a tad more humour i really enjoyed it though the music could have been better,4
4022,super funny action packed and it was just the right combination,4
4023,although not as good as batman returns and spiderman 1 but infinitely better than the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
4024,not only did baby groot get cuter but the guardians of the galaxy pretty much surprised us all and blew the whole world,4
4025,away from the spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit and heart,4
4026,not as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
4027,what i love about this film is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
4028,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
4029,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
4030,it works itself as a standalone film as well as in the first one and i'd say volume 2 is better than the first,4
4031,shane black has saved the iron man trilogy rdj returns and kills it again,4
4032,other than that it is a little underrated 78 %,4
4033,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film and without them this film would be nothing to be honest,4
4034,not quite as good as its predecessor but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
4035,he is an experienced writer but when it came to a cohesive long-running cinematic universe,4
4036,admittedly spider-man 3 and tas-man 2 were awesome movies and the amazing spider-man films ever made,4
4037,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
4038,but it was a great movie it had a few flaws with mandarin being a fake but forgetting that the film is a visual delight,4
4039,i really liked it and i'm excited to see what comes next,4
4040,marvel started their ramp up to dominance with a very good start for the new spider-man going places,4
4041,is still perfect as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best superhero films ever made,4
4042,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
4043,of course this was a great entrance to the marvel universe ant man and the wasp,4
4044,it works the only thing that's negative about this movie is the reason why mcu marvel cinematic universe took off,4
4045,the mid credits scene shows the wasp costume which i was not expecting to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
4046,the first time i was shocked in a marvel movie in forever thanks to it never taking itself too serious,4
4047,but overall this is the best marvel movie,4
4048,sam raimi did this so well with the marvel cinematic universe,4
4049,the characters are decent there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
4050,and after this film i'd have to say that movies are getting out of hand with after credit scenes,4
4051,with a great comeback performance by robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
4052,he doesn't get to say too many lines but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
4053,yes i was one of the best mcu movies,4
4054,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero film ant-man is a great action packed story,4
4055,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a lot of hate and going in i was hesitant,4
4056,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the scenes but that's just it,4
4057,can't wait to see the sequels and tom holland as the best spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
4058,easily one of the best superhero films of all time i wouldn't nessecarily go that far,4
4059,however if you haven't watched the other marvel movies we've seen in the mcu is solid,4
4060,it sadly doesn't live up to my expectations as much,4
4061,due to its presence in the mcu it's still a ton of fun,4
4062,all in all this is a perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
4063,the cast was phenomenal the cgi and makeup was brilliant the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
4064,was perfect casting and the action was great with a lot of heart in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
4065,again robert downey jnr is as impressive as ever as tony stark and the film itself is true to it's source,4
4066,the only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
4067,black panther is the latest as of feb 2018 of films directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the best marvel movies,4
4068,visually striking fueled by action and undeniably hilarious guardians of the galaxy is an amazing marvel film,4
4069,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
4070,the best thing about ant-man would be this awesome,4
4071,the action is spectacular the acting very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
4072,michael keaton is probably one of my favorite marvel movies,4
4073,one of the biggest and best surprises of 2014 guardians of the galaxy failed to live up to it,4
4074,the story could have been the most interesting part of the movie still this is a must-seen comic book movie,4
4075,what probably edges it vs marvels other super-team film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
4076,first they did a great job developing spider-man's role in things,4
4077,iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel universe that is able to conquer its occasionally misguided narrative,4
4078,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is that the rest of the cast was just as good,4
4079,josh brolin is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the best movies of 2014 action packed funny and emotional,4
4080,just when you thought the first movie was that they explained who thanos is and what his motivations are,4
4081,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy last year this basically came out of nowhere,4
4082,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
4083,this film carries on the stunning effects and witty humour that made the first film great and slimming the aspects that forced it to struggle,4
4084,finally hip hop is represented in marvel's cinematic universe iron man 3 features robert downey jr,4
4085,but really it's hard to expand on the already huge universe that began with ironman,4
4086,i liked this superhero movie more than most of the marvel cinematic universe and a truly life changing story of emotion wits and suspense,4
4087,if you were going into spider-man homecoming delivers a fun and entertaining piece,4
4088,in this film we see more of ant-man at 60 feet,4
4089,an incredibly good fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main villain,4
4090,it's by far one of the best action movies ever made,4
4091,some may not have liked it as much as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
4092,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is another great marvel movie,4
4093,the action throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
4094,when i first saw the original avengers i was excited to see all the suits and story was absolutely well delivered,4
4095,everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job with the tonal shifts and transitioning between different characters and locations,4
4096,in fact the character development in the movie was perfect and while it angered many fans of the franchise including myself,4
4097,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
4098,this is going to be a lot of fun,4
4099,definitely one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen in a long time,4
4100,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
4101,i'm now expecting one of the best origin films since the original iron man with a cameo of robert downey jr,4
4102,i really like iron man 3 even though acdc isn't in this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
4103,all told guardians is another great looking film that is sure to be a lot more interesting than others depending on the viewer,4
4104,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
4105,there's no arguing that this was the best marvel movie it definitely isn't the worst,4
4106,coming in as a sequel to one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever made,4
4107,my favorite part of the film at all,4
4108,a truly sensational way to tie together the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
4109,the action is not as interesting as the rest of us needless to say i loved this movie and apparently the audience did too,4
4110,although i had a headache afterwards i very much enjoyed the mix of action and humor makes this really enjoyable,4
4111,definitely a different pace than the other marvel movies with iron man being the first,4
4112,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it's not without its consequences or collateral damage,4
4113,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
4114,what i got to say is that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
4115,there's not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
4116,paul rudd scott lang ant-man is a must-see for hulk fans,4
4117,worth splurging for the blu-ray when it comes out on dvd or blue ray,4
4118,if the female characters were less one-dimensional it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
4119,great movie but it does nothing to build or connect into the marvel universe then get to the theater to see this yesterday,4
4120,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of marvel's most memorable films but it is not as good as the dark knight,4
4121,besides avengers this is my favorite of the iron man films i'd choose this one,4
4122,sometimes it's good to see one of the iron suits and suddenly be a total professional,4
4123,the sound track is as good as it's predecessor,4
4124,the special effects were very incredibles and unequaled because they make you feel like laughing crying and straight up just leave you in shock altogether,4
4125,the story is almost as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
4126,on top of that all the movies leading up to this i had been terrified i really didn't see coming at all,4
4127,tom holland was the best choice for the part there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
4128,that being said it is not a stand-alone movie without the weight of the universe crumbling down any minute,4
4129,ryan coogler has created the best marvel film i've seen and is pretty much the most you could ask for,4
4130,guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie with a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
4131,i loved the movie it was a refreshing movie in the marvel series so far in my view,4
4132,all in all age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
4133,this movie was amazing and made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be,4
4134,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't even interrupt and kill them both,4
4135,a better movie than iron man 2 and improves on it,4
4136,i loved this movie and it was amazing,4
4137,the complaints i have with this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
4138,the marvel films leading up to the avengers,4
4139,after learning that he was the brains and commander of this whole operation it would've been very intriguing and an unforgettable story,4
4140,i think jon favreau did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
4141,was perfect casting and the action was great and the story was good too,4
4142,you know what i re-watched guardian of the galaxy 2 is less empire strikes back and more age of ultron,4
4143,it may not be as fresh as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
4144,went to see avengers age of ultron was directed by joss whedon and zak penn,4
4145,it had the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
4146,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man even,4
4147,other scenes felt like a video game boss fight this movie is a must see and pure entertainment,4
4148,spider-man homecoming one of the strongest villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
4149,showing strong emotions throughout the film and done beautifully felt like they were there to set up more films,4
4150,the characters and not just the members of the avengers have had their own movies in a shared universe they rebooted the hulk,4
4151,best version of the character seems to be the marvel setup for the phase three films,4
4152,and seeing michael keaton as the vulture and he also plans on selling the rest of the universe,4
4153,is the perfect tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
4154,this might not be my most favourite mcu although it is one of the most discussed films of the decade infinity war,4
4155,why do many believe that iron man 2 is not as fun as the first one but still pretty fun,4
4156,a new and unique addition to the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
4157,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
4158,a new and unique addition to the marvel line-up,4
4159,though it may not be as strong as the first film and works on establishing his role in the marvel universe,4
4160,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
4161,ant-man might not be as awesome as the first film but it's still entertaining to watch,4
4162,funnier than both the previous iron man movies and the ambitious kickoff to the shared marvel cinematic universe,4
4163,which i like to say that it does not disappoint,4
4164,iron man is spectacular it's really funny the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
4165,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a just a sense of fun throughout the film,4
4166,i think some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man and the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
4167,shane black injects a blast of pure energy into the franchise with iron man 3 leading into phase 3 to begin with ant man,4
4168,it's hard that you do not like this one as much as the first and third films in franchise,4
4169,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action keeps the movie going at a consistant pace,4
4170,the character development in the film and they were all just as great as the movie is it is not one without flaws,4
4171,undeniably one of the greatest and the funniest superhero movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
4172,the best spider-man movie i've ever seen on the big screen,4
4173,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
4174,but not a lot of room to play and we get to see him reprise his role as the green goliath,4
4175,it's not quite the best spider-man flicks in a long time,4
4176,infinity wars was a great movie that brings spider-man back from the grave,4
4177,oldschool spider-man for the mcu and a huge moment for the mcu and a good spider-man movie yet,4
4178,paul rudd makes a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
4179,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man has quite a wild ride on the big screen worth it,4
4180,it emerges as have all previous films as a part of the movie is great it's not flawless,4
4181,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
4182,it would be 5 stars if i didn't give this movie a 4,4
4183,ultron is not lame but he's not really a sidekick really,4
4184,virtually no reference to any of the avengers so it feels more like a big even series of comics than a film,4
4185,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i can't wait for 3 to come out,4
4186,movie was a lot of fun for the whole family and it deserves a high rating just not sure as high as a 96,4
4187,i love how they set up all of the mightiest superheroes to save the world against evil,4
4188,the movie was able to deliver very well,4
4189,strengths director ryan coogler had a lot of fun and still has some good jokes,4
4190,some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the best marvel studio's movie ever made to date,4
4191,has never let me down and this film is probably the best marvel movie,4
4192,although it gets bit silly at times overall this was a great entry in 2017's superhero fare,4
4193,with so many characters there's a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero movies lack see the avengers,4
4194,honestly i have no idea why this film has a lot of iconic moments it unfortunately just wasn't as good as the first one,4
4195,anyway despite this essentially being more of the same from the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
4196,it would be 5 stars if i didn't have to sit through another origin for spider-man 2 cough,4
4197,everybody is good in this but the thing that makes this movie extremely entertaining is the humor,4
4198,war machine's costume design was awesome and this film is a good start on others,4
4199,the avengers was even better than the original,4
4200,it better be one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
4201,he was great as adrian toomes also known as the vulture played by michael keaton is a perfect casting,4
4202,and man and the wasp directed by payton reed is the sequel to james gunn's 2014 film of the same name,4
4203,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson who's so happy to see translated on the big screen in phenomenal,4
4204,behind the camera peyton reed does a good job at being nerdy and funny,4
4205,however its emotional center clearly makes it one of the best superhero films to date,4
4206,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
4207,this is more of an action-comedy marvel film,4
4208,that's not to say this was the first and one of the best they've done,4
4209,and finally we have an iron man movie but really good,4
4210,this movie was amazing and made me excited for the future of iron man and brings life to a smartly written origin story,4
4211,i can't wait to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
4212,overall this is easily one of the best movies in the mcu,4
4213,if you saw the first hulk and found it to be a big dud like it was too ambitious of a project,4
4214,still it remains one of the best superhero movies today,4
4215,when the villainous norse demi-god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good,4
4216,then i watched this movie and it is pretty good,4
4217,what an amazing way to make a movie about a group of heroes that almost nobody knows,4
4218,the story is great it's just perfect this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
4219,killmonger was easily one of the best movies ever made,4
4220,i enjoyed michael keaton as the vulture is one of the best superhero films to date with great chemistry between the casts,4
4221,what i've taken from this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
4222,when parker confronted him towards the end of the movie there was more fighting,4
4223,iron man has become one of marvel's most fun and entertaining films,4
4224,overall it's an mcu film is definitely a plus but it's not the same old tagline you tend to get with introductory films,4
4225,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the entire film,4
4226,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
4227,it's absolutely great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
4228,iron man might be the best of the summer,4
4229,it's very action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the marvel family and is linked very well to the marvel franchise,4
4230,this movie is almost if not quite as good as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
4231,along with thor ragnarok i think this film is better then the first avengers,4
4232,is fantastic as the initially chauvinistic tony stark it's a shame he's killed off at the end of the movie,4
4233,if it falls somewhat short of some of the best humour in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
4234,give it a chance even if you aren't up to date it makes for a rather fantastic ride,4
4235,a lot of it stems from the fact that it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
4236,saying this is a good movie but not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect,4
4237,much much better than the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
4238,nevertheless this was still a great movie,4
4239,jeff bridges does everything he can to portray the antagonist in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
4240,i think yondu was miscast but not thrown away at the same time it serves as a veritable break from all the iw stuff,4
4241,everything balanced out into one of the best films of the year,4
4242,but this film had jokes in the right moment it was very well done and the finale is also breathtaking,4
4243,what i expected was for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
4244,overall avengers age of ultron is a great sequel and overall it's very entertaining,4
4245,it did follow some tropes but it tended to write them in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
4246,it matches that he has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great protagonist,4
4247,plays the part he was born for the role of hank pym,4
4248,ultron with sense of humor i would say it is still a very good movie,4
4249,i like his snarkiness but he's still a teanager and learning to use his gifts,4
4250,good but non as memorable as the other mcu movies,4
4251,spider-man is a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
4252,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't bog down the movie,4
4253,gotg2 probably has one of the best superhero movies of all time for me at least,4
4254,i do find that marvel don't have the advantage of allowing filmmakers creative freedom,4
4255,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen in a new age,4
4256,some parts moved slowly but most of it was very well done and the finale is truly incredible,4
4257,in the film the original ant-man film and o just can't wait for the sequel,4
4258,the third act felt pretty rushed but overall i had a lot of high school humor but would be funny to all ages,4
4259,less robert downey jr and managed to jumpstart one of the biggest surprises for me in recent memory,4
4260,it's a amazing crossover and is one of the funniest comic book movies of all time for me at least,4
4261,way better than andrew garfield's amazing spider-man franchise that not only is one of the best the mcu has to offer,4
4262,that my friends is a whole new level of depth to the character of the mandarin,4
4263,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
4264,this was much better then the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
4265,i thought this would be a good movie,4
4266,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good reasons to have his butt kicked when he betrays him,4
4267,ok lets just say that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
4268,honestly it is kind of a lot to ask but this movie could have been so much better and just wasn't,4
4269,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once without suffering like spider-man,4
4270,it's absolutely great fun and a great start to the mcu,4
4271,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
4272,so at this time i'd would recommend this film for all ages saw this in 3d,4
4273,interesting twist in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
4274,vin diesel as groot is the best thing marvel has created yet,4
4275,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man michael keaton as the vulture are also great additions,4
4276,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
4277,1 after end of movie and another at the end of the iron man suits coming in to fight was spectacular,4
4278,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
4279,i enjoyed the movie and it's also funny,4
4280,the best of the mcu the action is great the music is great with on point acting and a fantastic story,4
4281,there are some very funny moments and it has a highly likable protagonist,4
4282,but with his humor and charisma as he is the perfect choice to be tony stark,4
4283,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
4284,aside from the few flaws this movie was a really good comic book movie,4
4285,and chris evans as iron man and i enjoyed it just as much this time,4
4286,spoilers if you haven't been watching all the marvel movies but still really good,4
4287,the marvel films leading up to the avengers i think it's a phenomena when three movies like this are all great,4
4288,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could have done a better job of portraying a good ai gone bad,4
4289,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action-packed beautiful and fast paced,4
4290,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
4291,i love love love so many aspects of guardians of the galaxy the funniest of the marvel cinematic universe,4
4292,in conclusion iron man was a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
4293,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
4294,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
4295,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
4296,this is the story of tony stark aka iron man still has significant issues,4
4297,it's kind of funny that the cheesiest of the marvel movies not all of them necessarily land,4
4298,however james spader did a good job at playing ant man i don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore,4
4299,in fact this is the first movie i did enjoy this,4
4300,james gunn's guardians of the galaxy is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
4301,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
4302,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it payed off big time,4
4303,if you're a fan of the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
4304,still it is one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies of 2014,4
4305,to summarize avengers infinity war is already happening,4
4306,entertaining and fun throughout antman and the wasp is a fun and wacky movie with great acting,4
4307,so much of the iron man is a sleek and fun entry in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
4308,thrilling ambitious and emotionally resonant black panther is a fun and exciting plot,4
4309,but guardians of the galaxy is obviously one of those films where i just don't understand the hate,4
4310,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't a sequel to the 2003 hulk like some people say it is,4
4311,great villain with a great plot twist at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
4312,my one big complaint about the film is that they focus on its characters,4
4313,the villain don't need to love comic books to love this movie warts and all,4
4314,all in all just as good as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
4315,this is one of the best marvel has ever made,4
4316,well best iron man movie i like it a lot more than iron man 2 but it isn't funny anymore despite attempts at humour,4
4317,this one however is a whole lot better than the previous film,4
4318,the king of wakanda both in his emotion towards scenes in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
4319,it is safe to say that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome,4
4320,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
4321,black panther is honest to god one of the best superhero films to date with great chemistry between the casts,4
4322,even though i do prefer mark ruffalo as bruce banner but this is still a first-rate marvel movie that i thoroughly enjoyed,4
4323,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
4324,not as good as the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
4325,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't bother me as much,4
4326,i thought it was an odd choice to launch a universe with iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
4327,tony stark was still a jerk but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
4328,if the movie serves its purpose it is a good movie with awesome special effects,4
4329,their is a whopping twist in this film and despite the villain is not as bad as some make it out to be,4
4330,i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of fun and even quite a bit of fun shouldnt factor into it,4
4331,there is sometimes some wonky cgi but that isn't saying much considering how great iron man was,4
4332,the action has some issues and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
4333,92 % iron man is a good movie is like saying this is the only mcu movie that i think is the funniest,4
4334,the third time around with spider-man homecoming injects new life into the character,4
4335,the incredible hulk is a film that is just for spectacle,4
4336,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and it all adds up to a fun and fresh epic adventure sequel,4
4337,some critics go to far saying the best spider-man film after only the original 2,4
4338,full of humor with great characters and a good story,4
4339,despite a smaller budget than other genre films peyton reed still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
4340,it may not live up to its predecessor but an enjoyable follow-up and mary poppins approves,4
4341,this is an extremely funny and good looking movie with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
4342,i enjoyed the avengers and with avengers age of ultron is a fun summer blockbuster,4
4343,a lot of the film's many highlights,4
4344,it doesn't quite meet the standard set by its predecessor but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
4345,the one thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care to be honest,4
4346,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
4347,though i may not be a fan of the franchise and shows some real promise for the inevitable next 2,4
4348,the closest to auteur cinema the marvel cinematic universe and the idea of bringing the avengers team to the big screen avengers,4
4349,nonetheless iron man is a great addition to the marvel family and is linked very well to the marvel franchise,4
4350,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and will be filled with heart,4
4351,iron man came out in 2008 and it helped to jumpstart the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
4352,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
4353,the first avengers is my favorite movie of all time its up there for me but not at the top,4
4354,two i felt that scott and hope's romance was a bit too slow for me but it was great from every other aspect,4
4355,fun comedy out of this world vfx and a good but not end of the workld plot wait for 2 trailers,4
4356,despite a weak third act avengers age of ultron is not as good as the first one though,4
4357,very good but arguably the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
4358,however my only complaint about the movie is that in the end each play beautifully of eachother,4
4359,it is not a bad movie but the ending was a bit controversial with tony getting rid of all of his suits,4
4360,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first one so damn good,4
4361,it's story is very good and she surpasses jennifer connelly,4
4362,with ego's presence the main theme of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
4363,paul rudd gives a sweet performance as the lead and easily one of the funniest movies in the mcu so far,4
4364,its testament to joss whedon's talents that he was able to deliver quite well on the performance level,4
4365,this film is better then the first avengers,4
4366,at the start of the marvel universe story arc,4
4367,is hilarious as iron man and i enjoyed it just as much this time,4
4368,so much of the iron man series falls in between the first and second act could've been a little bit more,4
4369,and that's all i have to say all the action scenes were simply stunning and brilliant,4
4370,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a nice refresher to have paul rudd and his comic relief,4
4371,to add loki is definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
4372,the antagonist in this movie but all i know that michael pena was one of the most influential and important movies of all time,4
4373,doesn't feel like a spider-man film we deserve,4
4374,there were so many great moments in the film make it a must see,4
4375,in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
4376,one of the greatest superhero films of all time but is very close to being it,4
4377,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie still this is a must watch,4
4378,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action packed and it was just great seeing all these beloved characters all on the big screen,4
4379,as a fresh take on the superhero genre iron man is one of the best superhero films of all time,4
4380,if there was anything i didn't like but overall i was floored,4
4381,the real mandarin turns out to be highly enjoyable and fun,4
4382,but one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
4383,ant-man proves that marvel can take any character no matter how obscure and turn them into a great movie and robert downey jr,4
4384,this movie has everything it needs to be has one of the cheesiest names and powers,4
4385,i would see it a second time and hearing the rest of the cast particularly michael keaton as the vulture are also great additions,4
4386,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
4387,this is what allowed him to hold an infinity stone during the conclusion of the movie some aspects do not add up especially involving obediah,4
4388,if you liked the first movie this movie is still a solid yet fun sequel to the outstanding original iron man,4
4389,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
4390,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
4391,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie and is one of the best action sequences,4
4392,with so much talent in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
4393,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
4394,damn this was much better than i expected when it was announced back in february 2015,4
4395,i think the producers knew how funny and popular the first movie was that they explained who thanos is and what his motivations are,4
4396,went deeper into some of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
4397,the actors bring life to the characters but the film is rightfully as the first film mainly because marvel unleashes yet another mediocre villain,4
4398,not as funny as the original iron man cartoon series brought to the big screen i think they did as good as they could,4
4399,after 10 long years of marvel movies leading up to this moment,4
4400,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
4401,was at his best if you like super heros you need to watch the other half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
4402,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
4403,a great follow-up and fine addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the first movie,4
4404,without many mistakes these risks have paid off for the most part does the job well and sets the tone of the movie,4
4405,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity,4
4406,overall it has a lot of action a lot of laughs out of me,4
4407,for me it was a very enjoyable movie,4
4408,the soundtrack to this film is one of the best marvel movies to date,4
4409,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best superhero movies to this day,4
4410,the effects are incredible and the plot is fast paced and helps you get drawn into the characters,4
4411,ant-man is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
4412,also there is a left-field romance that doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
4413,it's a lot of small things in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
4414,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of time to focus on characters,4
4415,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone adventure however and demands your previous fandom from the earlier films,4
4416,this one however is a whole lot better than the 1st you need to watch this,4
4417,iron man remains one of the strongest villains in the mcu now thanos holds the throne next to logi and kill monger,4
4418,you have not seen it then go see it you won't be disappointed,4
4419,i wonder how much was edited out due to tv constraints but it was still funny action packed and it was just a fun movie,4
4420,10 15 points go to the characters category,4
4421,it starts the beginning of the movie is focused on stark developing the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
4422,at least i didn't miss anything in spider-man homecoming spins a mighty fine web,4
4423,led by a charming sweet and funny performance from paul rudd ant man is a gripping and fun heist film that exceeded everyone's expectations,4
4424,one of the best movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
4425,as a stand alone film its one of the best lower scale superhero movies today,4
4426,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
4427,while it may not be one of the greatest superhero films of all time,4
4428,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor,4
4429,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
4430,there isn't much humor but there is lots of fun to be had in all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
4431,and of course i would be in remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
4432,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
4433,i thought the first one was good but the hype created too much of high expectations,4
4434,as the first movie but i really like the way they did ego the living planet and mantis,4
4435,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
4436,as fantastic as ruffalo was is as hulk it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
4437,full of humor with great characters and some amazing special effects,4
4438,i can't help but love him even when he does indeed help it only makes matter worse,4
4439,there's zero lag here everything has a purpose and the action sequences are entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
4440,i only wish his role in the movie was more serious than the first but better than the second one,4
4441,i caught the dark knight just the other night and you can't see how to beat him,4
4442,what i didn't like about this movie is the villian and this really does feel like mostly thanos's film,4
4443,i wasn't expecting much from this movie but i am so glad to see the rest of the cast is fine,4
4444,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the mcu,4
4445,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
4446,we see his motives as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
4447,simple and understandable plot with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
4448,the avengers is one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
4449,and then there's the action the special effects and cgi is well done not much to say here,4
4450,i'm very surprised how good this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
4451,great movie but the ending was meh not enough action it felt like it paid off by the time the finale hit,4
4452,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most recognisable studios today,4
4453,10 for marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy that had so much that was tiresome,4
4454,it's also one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu so far,4
4455,the villain is one of the first and certainly among the best the marvel cinematic universe,4
4456,not as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action spectacle finale,4
4457,the acting by holland and keaton were spectacular as well as the great work by marisa tomei aunt may,4
4458,sam raimi made two great spider-man movies but still really good,4
4459,this is still a really fun movieand is probably one of my favorite marvel movies for sure,4
4460,the greatest deal in this spider-man's powers come to life in the best possible funniest way,4
4461,is the perfect iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
4462,rarely do i ever suggest seeing anything but the original where it all started and its just classy superhero fun,4
4463,however it is still one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
4464,7 10 points go to the development category,4
4465,the return of iron man is a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
4466,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended,4
4467,another weakness of the movie lies in the plot and throughout the film,4
4468,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
4469,tom holland is an amazing spider-man was the introduction to the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
4470,the first good spider-man film we deserve,4
4471,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
4472,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
4473,a well-balanced mix of comedy action and special effects are pretty good,4
4474,i didn't think a movie like this in which they're more prevalent,4
4475,though it can't recapture the same magic as the first film and without them this film would be nothing to be honest,4
4476,the only major hangup of this film is the design of its script,4
4477,the film has a great sense of comedy to it,4
4478,five years later we got the rebooted amazing spider-man and peter's life together,4
4479,black panther is at least on a par with any of the other superhero movies though they provide a richer context,4
4480,definitely one of the best villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
4481,the third movie in the avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit more but i understand why the crew left it out,4
4482,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is leagues better than 2 and is just as great as he was in the last one,4
4483,in the end the action was pretty entertaining and it was just the best introduction of antman to the avenger series,4
4484,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
4485,do because guardians of the galaxy is one of the most exciting movies out there,4
4486,i started to play the game trying to capture the flag as i never died the two times i captured it,4
4487,i really had no desire to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron,4
4488,in this movie he has become the king of wakanda has passed away and his son t'challa has taken the mantle,4
4489,iron man is one of these movies that lives on it's own without having seen the other films associated with this genre,4
4490,sets the stage for a lot of artistic interpretation,4
4491,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
4492,michael keaton is great as the villain i do think a bit too much acclaim guardians of the galaxy,4
4493,this is a great movie that having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
4494,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
4495,there's nothing quite like the action in this movie it's not without its consequences or collateral damage,4
4496,seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
4497,vulture michael keaton was such a good villain and a level of suspense,4
4498,doesn't quite hold up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
4499,it really shows that she is powerful like she is in the comics it was typically hank pym himself but whatever,4
4500,leading the way again black panther is one of the best first half's of all of marvel's movies,4
4501,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
4502,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other well but this end got to me,4
4503,plot the film starts out as most franchise starting films do with a lot of story and definitely setups for multiple films,4
4504,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is a very well done sequel,4
4505,but is it a great addition to the spider-man story,4
4506,i have to say all the action scenes were colorful and visually appealing,4
4507,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
4508,when i first saw this movie but it was just so entertaining,4
4509,it is an addition to the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
4510,much much better than the second not quite as good as ant-man manages to be the mcu's most surprisingly funny movie yet,4
4511,i really didn't like the first one but still very enjoyable and fun to watch but also really emotional when the time comes,4
4512,it's story is very good and i love the casting that has been done,4
4513,can't wait to see it again to know that,4
4514,all in all this movie is all about tiny things and tiny people,4
4515,also the special effects and action sequences are amazing,4
4516,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
4517,i found this much better than infinity wars though not as much as i praise this movie it does have some problems,4
4518,that my friends is a whole new level of depth to the character of robert downey jr,4
4519,i didn't think it was really the character but rather the actor i just didn't buy him as this military colonel,4
4520,these aspects plus great performances all around and incredible action sequences,4
4521,the side characters are some of the best action movies but it tanks in act 3,4
4522,the final battle alone is one of the greatest movie franchises of all time,4
4523,the best scene in this movie is a non-stop thrill ride,4
4524,character development on thanos could have been done a bit better but i still don't like it more,4
4525,i actually forgot i was watching a movie about badass superheroes during the first act of the film felt intimidating and chilling,4
4526,tony stark's third adventure is highly entertaining and a must see movie as i also watched it twice,4
4527,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first ant-man and the wasp,4
4528,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
4529,the script is very carefully written the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy,4
4530,this is by far the best marvel movie,4
4531,best thing about this marvel film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
4532,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
4533,i was a huge fan of his role in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are full of chemistry,4
4534,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the best action movies ever made,4
4535,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
4536,as a marvel space movie it's worth a watch even if you aren't a fan of iron man,4
4537,one of my favorite movies in the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
4538,kendrick lamar was the perfect person to be ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
4539,basically as good as it predecessor but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
4540,he doesn't get to say too many lines but it doesn't meet the high expectations it was set at,4
4541,the main downside to this film is one of the film's overabundance of characters,4
4542,definitely not the greatest film in the mcu or it's not nearly as good as the first one if that,4
4543,anyway yes this was a great start to the marvel cinematic even if things go a little too overboard at the end,4
4544,if you are a fan of doesn't have as much humour as the original movie,4
4545,in fact his whole presence was the best part of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
4546,the relationship between peter parker and mary jane in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
4547,a good deal better than iron man 2 is a film with greater lasting value than its predecessor,4
4548,ant man is twice better than i expected it to be a giant mess,4
4549,meanwhile in another note it's better than the 2003 film but not as dull as the second iron man movie,4
4550,i am just an average white guy i think this is up there for me as one of the all time great villains,4
4551,there was a lot of fun to boot and the film is really a top highlight,4
4552,the uniquely talented master-manipulator natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to combine their talents and work together,4
4553,some people have complained about the fact that this film attacked racism while entertaining even those who do not apply to that status,4
4554,starts getting a pretty major role in this film but it's worth watching for a good time,4
4555,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast,4
4556,the only problem in this movie isn't as great as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
4557,ant man and the wasp is the breath of fresh air to the spider-man franchise,4
4558,overall though if this movie had a lot of expectations from me and many others,4
4559,at least i didn't miss anything in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
4560,with all that said we only get to the rest of the avengers as much as the first one,4
4561,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
4562,nonetheless iron man is a triumph of an action movie due to great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
4563,i loved it but not as much as the first tho,4
4564,great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is a few things missing on here and i don't know why,4
4565,it's not as good as the first one but it does set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
4566,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye,4
4567,the best marvel has ever made not just including the mcu marvel cinematic universe and quite frankly i enjoyed this more than i expected,4
4568,it's not completely perfect but in a way that hurts rather than helping the story,4
4569,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
4570,black panther is full of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
4571,it's definitely not the best movie in the mcu because it is,4
4572,a surprising and very fun and funny entry in the mcu with everything you love in super hero movies,4
4573,aside ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
4574,however this is the first movie i did enjoy this,4
4575,plus it's a great movie and a great take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
4576,great villain with a great plot twist at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
4577,ant man is a fun time to watch,4
4578,however they set up the rest of the cast were good to mediocre,4
4579,it also helps that it's one of the best superhero films totally worth your time,4
4580,loved this movie and yet again his acting was on point with great dialogue and comedic timing,4
4581,highlight is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
4582,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
4583,jeff bridges also does a fantastic job with this film and i can't wait to see part 2,4
4584,killian just was one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
4585,so aside from some cringey gross out moments i don't really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves,4
4586,believe the hype marvel's the avengers would be an a,4
4587,even though i had seen the prequel to this movie with the immense role of yondu played by michael rooker and his band of ravagers,4
4588,the best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
4589,reilly glenn close and benicio del toro so the film has a strong direction but it's not supposed to,4
4590,not as great as the first one but i still really like it and robert downey jr is hilarious as always,4
4591,much better than the second installment if not quite as good as the first iron man was quite a treat during its theatrical release,4
4592,the plot of the film does a great job as spidey,4
4593,still this was an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than what anybody else could have thought of which i personally agree,4
4594,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underrated superhero,4
4595,it's funny the cast is great and the cinematography is stunning,4
4596,he's one of the few white characters who rears his head in the film he was just too good looking to be a monster,4
4597,he is still just trying desperately to save the world from an alien army,4
4598,is his sarcastic self and the action is nothing short of amazing,4
4599,ant-man is a smaller-scale installment to the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
4600,what disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
4601,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
4602,one of the best comic book films i've seen in a long long time,4
4603,i loved pretty much every spider-man movie the story was amazing and the abomination idea was awesome,4
4604,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and i enjoyed it thouroughly,4
4605,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best marvel movies so far,4
4606,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
4607,hands down the best portrayal of peter parker spider-man but they failed,4
4608,liked it a lot ultron was a great villain and michael keaton was for real,4
4609,jon watts's spider-man movies have had to date,4
4610,i didn't love this film but it payed off big time,4
4611,loved this movie but it was really good,4
4612,pretty cheesy with a lot of hilarious humor and exciting action sequences as the unique team of heroes recruited by s,4
4613,avengers infinity war is a thrilling experience that was well worth the long agonizing excruciating wait,4
4614,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
4615,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
4616,iron man was always one of my favorite openings to a movie ever,4
4617,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
4618,ant man is twice better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
4619,this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
4620,good movie best spiderman to have come out in a long time and i can now forget about that ant-man travesty,4
4621,otherwise it is full of action-packed adventure with some laughs along the way,4
4622,not the best marvel cinematic universe films to date it's also the funniest out of the trilogy,4
4623,let this be an example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
4624,but they did and it worked a lot better than i thought it was super entertaining,4
4625,though the plot is paper thin the way the characters interact with each other and whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that,4
4626,as entertaining as the first ant-man,4
4627,the only reason i didn't give it all the stars,4
4628,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
4629,marvel started their ramp up to dominance with a very good start for the new spider-man film,4
4630,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
4631,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
4632,all of the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel like a typical marvel movie and that,4
4633,overall marvel's the avengers is the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
4634,but not a lot of other marvel stuff,4
4635,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie from an action standpoint,4
4636,tom holland plays in my opinion the most human characters in the mcu i can't complain about the villain too much,4
4637,not as good as the 1st one and it may not be the best but its certainly in the top five,4
4638,ant man is a marvel movie done right,4
4639,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
4640,phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
4641,overall iron man is one of the few movies in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
4642,after his breakthrough supporting turn in captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
4643,i have to agree with everyone that it's a good sequel to the first avengers,4
4644,the characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story was good still i give this one 4 and a half,4
4645,this is not yhe most elaborate super hero movie ever made but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
4646,ant-man may not live up to its predecessor but it finds a comfortable place in the marvel cinematic universe,4
4647,yes i recommend this film to those who've seen infinity war,4
4648,played very well the role of tony stark iron man and he will never be topped,4
4649,the one thing that i really liked about this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
4650,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
4651,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
4652,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
4653,this is an absolutely brilliant spider-man movie i've ever seen not only in the marvel universe,4
4654,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil,4
4655,well balanced between all the characters which while standard in most super hero movies this is the villain and for good reason,4
4656,don't know if he's as amazing as the first but still a solid film,4
4657,another great marvel film but this avengers movie was not as good as vol 1 but great fun and interesting development of the characters,4
4658,black panther is an amazing film and on of the best mcu movies and it will probably stay that way forever,4
4659,this was by far the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
4660,i think the producers knew how funny and popular the first movie was that they explained who thanos is and what his motivations are,4
4661,this film carries on the stunning effects and witty humour that made the first one slightly more special than it already was,4
4662,thanks to marvel studios to show the comic accurate spiderman on the big screen doing what many fans hoped would never happen,4
4663,this is a superhero movie not a comedy so there has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
4664,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is still a solid entry in the mcu so far,4
4665,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
4666,definitely the best spider-man film of all time,4
4667,hell in the end of the film i found the action to be honest,4
4668,much like last summer's wonder woman this is a movie worth remembering and watching with the whole family,4
4669,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between but there still there,4
4670,10 15 points go to the direction category,4
4671,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
4672,when i saw this movie for the first time is great and the effects are awesome,4
4673,guardians of the galaxy is that rare blockbuster that inspires one to make a movie about a group of heroes that almost nobody knows,4
4674,their action sequence was a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
4675,the visuals are solid though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
4676,one of the complaints i have with this movie is that peter parker is way too reliant on tony stark,4
4677,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't have to go to incredibles 2,4
4678,the characters and not just the members of the avengers in this film actually turns out to be someone totally different,4
4679,if homecoming proved anything it was that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
4680,one of the mcu's best but ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character,4
4681,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
4682,ant-man is another fantastic marvel film with great special effects that are mind-boggling to behold,4
4683,it's something that i would definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
4684,another i had no idea what guardians of the galaxy is an amazing marvel film,4
4685,they did a fantastic job as the main villain is by far the best part about the movie,4
4686,the credit rests in a lot of ways it's one of his better aperrances,4
4687,all of these could have probably been answered with a bit of horror added in there too,4
4688,on top of that he puts up a hell of a ride from beginning till the end,4
4689,8 10 points go to the writing category,4
4690,scarlet which and vision are incredible additions to the team its oh my gosh,4
4691,i thought it was a good rollercoaster ride,4
4692,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
4693,definitely a recommended film and well worth checking out for a big budget popcorn action flick,4
4694,i thought ed norton did a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
4695,their is a whopping twist in this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
4696,the marvel films leading up to this i had been terrified i really didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
4697,getting kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
4698,successful in a lot of things going on at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
4699,this one is much simpler and very enjoyable to watch such a great marvel movie on a small scale,4
4700,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
4701,going in i knew it was gon na be marvel's first big flop,4
4702,this film was great it's not meant for me,4
4703,the quantum universe had one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
4704,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
4705,the final fight scene and the ending of the movie it seems like there is going to be a difficult job to top this one,4
4706,this avengers movie has to be one of the best comic book adaptations i've ever seen,4
4707,guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
4708,the vision is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
4709,i agree with rotten tomatoes that iron man 2 is entertaining and stands out as another successful marvel film,4
4710,sure he wants to move on with his life so it feels like a disney movie and not the marvel cinematographic universe,4
4711,my favourite action scene is the finale as well as the brothers-in-arms relationship of yondu and rocket,4
4712,however not as fresh as iron man 1 but better than 2,4
4713,i think those who've seen every film in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
4714,this is an extremely funny and good looking movie with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
4715,overall probably the 3rd best spider-man movie comes out,4
4716,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best recent mcu releases to date,4
4717,it is time to team up all of the characters and each get there time to shine in the final battle highly recommend,4
4718,the hulk and black widow love story this took away from the movie at times,4
4719,the entire scene seems forced as if the movie is actually working is it really that big a deal,4
4720,after seeing man of steel it was great to see the guardians back on the big screen,4
4721,it works the only thing that's negative about this movie is the war machine actor,4
4722,it's even funnier than the first film and does it better,4
4723,teamcap4lifereally a fun movie though there were a few things they did really right,4
4724,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it,4
4725,just a really funny movie with a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero movies lack see the avengers,4
4726,this one is my favorite of the marvel movies but hey that's what we live for the avenger fights,4
4727,despite some minor flaws iron man is well versed in its understanding of the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
4728,they help this movie to feel like a well fleshed out and satisfying movie,4
4729,wish that the hulk had more screen time but it's a great sequel with a lot of comedy,4
4730,a movie that is going to mean a lot to a lot of people thought in 2009 that disney would ruin marvel,4
4731,for anyone concerned about ant-man and 20th addition to the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
4732,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of comedy to it,4
4733,the result is a fun marvel film not the best but i think i may like captain america the winter soldier,4
4734,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a couple here or there but it's not supposed to,4
4735,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big fan of iron man now and this is one of marvel's best,4
4736,overall though like i said not as memorable as the first iron man's drama had a baby with the second movie's humor,4
4737,while it was nowhere as amazing as the first one not by a long shot,4
4738,this movie was so much fun to watch as the first one,4
4739,who provides a lot of fun and the effects are brilliant and it has some very impressive action sequences it adds a lot of humor,4
4740,by building on that favreau found his movie and it's a good change from the same old superhero,4
4741,a great movie one of marvels best films to date and a great way to kick off the marvel movie universe,4
4742,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is actually more about banner which is a logical step in the series,4
4743,iron man 3 might be the best looking comic book film i've seen so far in 2018,4
4744,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
4745,the third act is everything when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasn't the case,4
4746,i definitely liked it better than the first,4
4747,rdj does a great job of introducing ant-man,4
4748,had zero expectations for this movie since the first one did which makes it stand out among its peers,4
4749,great soundtrack and easily some of the best in the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
4750,and there's still plenty of action and laughs this movie gave me,4
4751,gives us one of the most hilarious characters,4
4752,iron man is the movie that started it all also happens to be one of the best films of the mcu,4
4753,alan silvestri's score is fantastic and the villain in this movie and compromises were made,4
4754,underrated superhero flick with great performances and an action-packed and supper funny,4
4755,robert downey is the perfect iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
4756,in conclusion this film is an awesome story from beginning to end we had fight scene after fight scene,4
4757,totally different from the other marvel films this is one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen in my life,4
4758,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of marvel's most fun and entertaining films,4
4759,in conclusion iron man was a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
4760,the acting by holland and keaton were spectacular as well as the athleticism of spider-man and peter's life together,4
4761,thank god we didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
4762,i really like chris evans as captain america mark ruffallo as the hulk scarlett johansson as black widow is a lot better in my head,4
4763,and don't worry there is still a good chunk of the film that is a 4 5 very good,4
4764,after seeing this ant man will no longer be running the stark industry causing controversy to arise,4
4765,ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
4766,a bit of a letdown but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
4767,it must be said that black panther is a solid film in the realm of sometimes boring marvel sequels,4
4768,black panther review 2018 the goodchadwick boseman as t'challa black panther is a turning point for two main characters damn does it drag on,4
4769,just seeing all these characters come together for the first time was like a dream come true this movie,4
4770,it's an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than that movie,4
4771,i don't know about you but i can not wait that they do with him in future installments,4
4772,as for the villains tom hiddelston once again does a good job always full on and action is shot in a good format,4
4773,despite these drawbacks the overall story and connectable and strong characters make up for it as there were absolutely hysterical scenes,4
4774,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i didn't have to go to incredibles 2,4
4775,avengers infinity war in my opinion is the best movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
4776,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments that the marvel cinematic universe,4
4777,my only gripe with the movie is the way it takes the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team,4
4778,so overall it's a must-see,4
4779,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
4780,all of your original cast members from the guardians of the galaxy last year this basically came out of nowhere,4
4781,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is that the rest of the series,4
4782,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
4783,throw in some of the best cgi i have ever seen and also one of the more ill fated hero,4
4784,iron man 1 and 2 both had disappointing climaxes and this is the first iron man movie but it has a bit too much,4
4785,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
4786,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best villains with the perfect shade of grey in killmonger,4
4787,great movie the best in the entire mcu,4
4788,marvel's guardians of the galaxy 2 provides a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when there's no action taking place,4
4789,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie and started the whole cinematic universe very nicely,4
4790,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun but once again it had a bad villain,4
4791,mark ruffalo is a better bruce banner but edward norton did pull of the timid and helpless side pretty well,4
4792,marvel has not done me wrong yet and ant-man is one who is not good at being spiderman yet,4
4793,too many villains and plotlines are what keep it from being one of marvel's better movies and far better than no,4
4794,can't wait to see them incorporated into the second half of the movie and becoming a monstrous over-large cgi video game boss,4
4795,however the third act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man film yet spider-man 2,4
4796,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments that the marvel cinematic universe fans of ant-man movies,4
4797,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a great superhero origin story possibly my favorite,4
4798,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
4799,that makes developing a fresh spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
4800,the action is filmed so well everyone in this movie was amazing and made me excited for the character's future,4
4801,it's a amazing crossover and is one of the best villains marvel is had recently with michael b,4
4802,it adds to the story of tony stark aka iron man who acts as his mentor,4
4803,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
4804,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character were nothing short of amazing,4
4805,the only problem i have with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
4806,one of the reasons spider-man has quite a wild ride on the big screen instead of vulture,4
4807,as with every other marvel studios film pacing tone plot special effects and action are typically top notch the story leaves alot to be desired,4
4808,this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
4809,the film was intense all the way through generic at parts though,4
4810,maybe if he made one interaction with ultron i would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
4811,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
4812,turns out it was far better than i thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy,4
4813,iron man 3 was a great film with great action sequences and an overall strong summer action film,4
4814,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that have all started to run together,4
4815,nothing that new to the superhero genre and one of the best movies,4
4816,the humour is quick-witted the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
4817,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
4818,thrilling ambitious and emotionally resonant black panther is a turning point for two main characters damn does it drag on,4
4819,the only beef i had with the film is the visuals,4
4820,pratt excels as star-lord's dad,4
4821,overall iron man 3 is just as good if not better as the first iron man,4
4822,the best part of the film at all,4
4823,chris pratt is the star though in every sense of the word the action is great and entertaining,4
4824,after watching ironman3 i think it is worth to watch to understand the story,4
4825,with great action scenes and very humorous comedy this is the movie for you a little,4
4826,without giving away too much one of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
4827,if the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
4828,do because guardians of the galaxy is up there with the dark knight but still terrific fun,4
4829,aside from these flaws ant-man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
4830,the avengers age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been so close to perfect,4
4831,avengers age of ultron was directed by joss whedon and zak penn,4
4832,avenger's infinity war is a solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe iron man is my favorite one,4
4833,a good worthy addition to the iron man trilogy,4
4834,the complaints i have with this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr,4
4835,iron man gives the marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the best movies of 2018,4
4836,however i have to say that it really rocks,4
4837,the villain is a little shallow but that is the core of the movie adds more value to franchise,4
4838,i like this one better than the first avengers movie,4
4839,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
4840,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
4841,it's very action-packed and creative space opera,4
4842,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
4843,the film that kicked off the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
4844,besides those few things i give this movie 4 reels out of 5,4
4845,one of my favorite films of the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
4846,the story is brilliant and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
4847,homecoming is a really fun and cool film,4
4848,black widow thor captain america and the guardians of the galaxy vol,4
4849,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first one an instant classic,4
4850,nowhere nearly as good as its predecessor but that doesn't mean its perfect,4
4851,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
4852,this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe fetches yet another greatly directed cinematic piece of art,4
4853,i thought the first one was good but the beginning was a little off,4
4854,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
4855,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is leagues better than 2 and is just as great as he was in civil war,4
4856,with a new villain in town peter parker must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
4857,because of that i do enjoy this movie better than age of ultron,4
4858,i continue to insist that paul bettany is one of the greatest movie franchises of all time,4
4859,i have to say that it does not have to be an origin story,4
4860,this is a movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again,4
4861,rating 84%although not as compelling as its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be a stellar entry full of fun and action and surprises,4
4862,with the flawless casting of robert downey jr is eminently watchable,4
4863,the first movie made in a series of avengers all leading up to this have sold the concept of these heroes coming together,4
4864,but because the emotional weight on thanos's side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
4865,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
4866,even though the novelty of seeing earth's mightiest heroes come together for an action-packed plot,4
4867,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
4868,9 10 iron man the one that started it all also happens to be one of the best superhero movies ever,4
4869,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
4870,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best tv series of this generation,4
4871,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie which is also really refreshing to see with the family and friends,4
4872,after sacrificing himself at the end of the film all of the characters in this movie,4
4873,one of the best mcu films in a while and a diffident stand out performance for robert downey jr,4
4874,the secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused,4
4875,i even love this movie more than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
4876,the writers knew what they were doing from the beginning and thrills throughout,4
4877,paul rudd is class as always and michael pena is really funny and a fun movie,4
4878,now the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the all time great villains,4
4879,amazing start from the marvel universe with great humor action scenes that show no exaggerated destruction and personal drama,4
4880,this is a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
4881,still highly re-watchable today iron man hits every note for a superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
4882,a funny and dignified film it is that it feels as if there is no real emotional gut punch here,4
4883,this film isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
4884,nevertheless it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a lush visual style and score make it all possible,4
4885,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
4886,as enjoyable as the ones when they are just conversing with each other and the large action sequences more than make up for it,4
4887,a lot of people complain about the other mcu movies it was worth watching and i'm glad that i did,4
4888,the director of the movie did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
4889,tom holland's portrayal of peter parker spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
4890,so iron man 3 is more of the same in the first movie and adding a bit more whimsy and excitement on top of it,4
4891,the 2003 version of the character seems to be the best spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe,4
4892,verdict it might not be as great as the first but not disappointed,4
4893,but it was a better spider-man film since the original iron man,4
4894,very entertaining from start to finish to the point where i actually cared,4
4895,tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
4896,i really liked the beginning of the film is the visuals,4
4897,chris hemsworth as thor is also great and although i really didn't like is the farmhouse scenes and the weird scenes with thor,4
4898,to me the focus of the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
4899,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as the first one yes,4
4900,a feel-good hilarious addition to the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
4901,this is a great film with a great premise and some great action sequences,4
4902,i ways worried about how iron man was going to be the worst of the iron man films,4
4903,tony is definitely paying for his declaration at the end of the movie there was more fighting,4
4904,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
4905,this film had more than i have ever seen and also one of the more ill fated hero,4
4906,not bad for a culmination of 10 years worth of build up and demonstrates a new trend in movie franchises,4
4907,the third act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man film we deserve,4
4908,after i watched this movie originally when it was released and i have to say all the action scenes were also pretty impressive,4
4909,its the one of the best twists ever,4
4910,sure there are a few weak entries but i don't know what they're missing,4
4911,plus it's nice to see a spider-man movie so far,4
4912,with a clever script and a fine performance by robert downey jr and boy it does it not disappoint,4
4913,judging by the ending of the film was intense at parts but still had humours jokes within,4
4914,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
4915,while the climactic showdown between iron man and the final product is executed so well,4
4916,it's the first work of the iron man movies are all very good,4
4917,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best super hero movies ever,4
4918,almost no one had even heard of guardians of the galaxy 2 boy i wanna get tickets to those,4
4919,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and one that was better than the first,4
4920,21-year-old british actor tom holland from the impossible in the heart of new york ready to fight for humanity was ever so important,4
4921,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i'm interested to see what antman does in the next infinity war,4
4922,this combined with the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
4923,up there with the dark knight but this is a superhero movie,4
4924,also the changes in mood when spoiler pepper potts gwyneth paltrow who acts as a caretaker love interest for our ironclad hero,4
4925,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
4926,5 out of 10 a great follow up to it's prior film,4
4927,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best spider-man movie the story was amazing and each scene kept me interested,4
4928,i can't say this is the best of the trilogy,4
4929,but only because i knew about all of the other characters in this movie,4
4930,i definitely liked it better than the first,4
4931,well made well acted and well written a film which lives up to it's hype with a fantastic performance by james spader as ultron,4
4932,anyway despite this essentially being more of the same in the first movie,4
4933,a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe has shown on screen,4
4934,you do feel like there's a lot more to the story,4
4935,the only problem i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
4936,a fun marvel movie and a must see movie experience,4
4937,robert downey is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
4938,7 10 points go to the development category,4
4939,happily black panther is their latest entry and not only is it one of the best superhero films of all time,4
4940,in my opinion iron man 3 is honestly pretty damn fun,4
4941,i like the more light-hearted marvel effort after the events of civil war and infinity war,4
4942,not saying james spader did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
4943,when ned was on screen he made the film better with his humor and acting combined together with the iron man suit,4
4944,movie was not perfect but was a lot of potential for his motives and time could've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
4945,while ant-man has the smallest chance of being a very good film overall,4
4946,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
4947,only three years after the last spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
4948,the movie was more serious than the first but still a good film,4
4949,but it is nonetheless one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
4950,fun but lacked the strong story that made the first one so damn good,4
4951,character development on thanos could have been done a bit better but i still don't like it more,4
4952,i did not expect to be a good movie but i thought that there was too much high school-y stuff,4
4953,it all the major characters that feature in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
4954,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie right,4
4955,this is the best marvel movie to date,4
4956,2 is a great follow up to the first film,4
4957,although one can always wonder what this movie is and that this movie is hilarious,4
4958,infinity war is the culmination of phase 1 of the marvel series,4
4959,michael keaton steals the show in my opinion,4
4960,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
4961,this is a great action packed marvel movie with a bit of dialogue with tony stark or scenes in the beginning or something,4
4962,hiring james gunn for these movies is one of the most underrated of the mcu movies,4
4963,still it's a great sequel with a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero films fail to do today,4
4964,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous deficient plot,4
4965,doesn't have the same amount of fun from the first movie but i liked it a lot ultron was a great villain,4
4966,the film is a build-up to this movie was very good,4
4967,there's a few things i didn't like about this movie is the war machine actor,4
4968,but marvel studios has set the standard so high its stil one of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
4969,but this movie is still a solid entry in the marvel franchise but it's not full of them,4
4970,not a flawless mcu film but it's got everything you could want in a movie,4
4971,good and fun experience tom did a great job with things like the shots of ant-man,4
4972,there's not much to get surpirsed but you will enjoy this action comedy with the whole family,4
4973,i still like that one more but i do think that this is a chance he earned the right for,4
4974,there was no real proper build up to it and it did get emotionally powerful when scott shrunk into those molecules,4
4975,i feel this movie showcased one of the best movies i've seen in a long time,4
4976,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
4977,the first official marvel avenger film and also the first that deals with issues affecting black people around the world,4
4978,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are out of this world,4
4979,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and some very different style fight scenes than i'm used to,4
4980,this movie is one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
4981,92 % iron man is a fresh take on the story of tony stark,4
4982,whether it was through cartoons coloring books children's adventures spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
4983,come pacing issues and is pretty boring in the beginning but the action is great the music is great the special effects are incredible,4
4984,besides avengers this is my favorite of the three iron man movies,4
4985,another major plus for the film is that they focus on its characters,4
4986,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
4987,the final battle alone is one of the most highly successful movie franchises in history,4
4988,the director joss whedon has created a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
4989,plus it's great that the marvel films are good this is no exception,4
4990,the incredible hulk was the coolest thing about this movie is the war machine actor,4
4991,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been cooler to see him in that's not insidious,4
4992,iron man 2 is not as fun as the first one it has fun size gags and a likable cast,4
4993,if you liked the first movie this movie is still a solid yet fun sequel to the outstanding original iron man,4
4994,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast,4
4995,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
4996,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
4997,probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it but only wish there was more action,4
4998,a strong reboot for spidey spider-man homecoming is the right place to look,4
4999,guardians of the galaxy is just a good movie im looking forward to seeing ant-man's story and background,4
5000,i thought the first one was good but the beginning was a little off,4
5001,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best spider-man movie comes out,4
5002,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
5003,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie it somehow makes use of just about all of them,4
5004,this may even be as good as most of the other parts of the movie,4
5005,tom holland is easily the best part of the film is also slow and a bit too silly at some places,4
5006,and luckily the script is a whopping breath of fresh air in a series that's already on a hot streak,4
5007,a very surprising entry into the mcu and making a strong social statement,4
5008,what i like i really liked ant-man and the wasp delivers,4
5009,near the end of the day it serves as a plot device and nothing else,4
5010,i think i wouldn't be honest if i didn't have to tie into the big conflicts of the universe,4
5011,it features tom holland as peter parker spider-man was spot-on,4
5012,unlike thor ragnorok whose still good humor often felt like it was made for younger demographic at times even though it is pg13,4
5013,no i do not think this is the less remembered movie in the mcu,4
5014,i love the humor even if there's not a lot of room to play and we get to see him big small medium,4
5015,after such high stakes with age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
5016,really funny and a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
5017,a visually impressive and narratively intriguing origin story iron man set a new standard for the mcu despite suffering from some of the same traits,4
5018,the main reason why this movie is the route they took with rocket,4
5019,michael keaton is probably one of the best in the marvel series so far in my view,4
5020,great performance by robert downey jr is a promising start to the marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the best,4
5021,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to the big screen and it works so well,4
5022,overall though iron man remains one of the best superhero origin stories in a film to date,4
5023,aside from the constant plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is an immensely satisfying movie that is sure to dazzle and amaze,4
5024,and don't worry there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
5025,would probably see again if i didn't give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
5026,2 is a great follow up to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
5027,the villain could have been a train wreck but the movie was more satisfying than i was expecting,4
5028,what makes age of ultron great is that it introduces two important characters and it's funny and clever and surprising,4
5029,more fun than expected and also one of the more ill fated hero,4
5030,iron man 3 is an intelligent and action-packed guardians of the galaxy but in the same level as its predecessor,4
5031,its refreshing to see him in the front lines,4
5032,plus it's one of the deepest movies in the marvel franchise gets a solid 5 stars from me,4
5033,the characters are all very unique and if you're anything like me you'll laugh almost the entire movie,4
5034,iron man 3 is nowhere near as good as the sequel as it wasn't as good as age of ultron,4
5035,even if you're not a marvel fan then go see it you won't be sorry,4
5036,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
5037,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the antagonists from the first film and you get a great film,4
5038,the storyline is well cut and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
5039,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a heartbreaking story of the scarlett witch and quicksilver,4
5040,i could have used more screen time but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
5041,does not beat the first one but still a great movie,4
5042,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
5043,a ton of fun and a phenomenal ending,4
5044,then other bad thing turned out to be a great move,4
5045,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle the movie finds a way to fit in some humour,4
5046,by far the best marvel movie i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
5047,guardians of the galaxy is a very fun and entertaining movie with a lot of comedy,4
5048,wow i didn't expect to enjoy it much but i didn't actually hate it,4
5049,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
5050,probably the best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
5051,more fun than the original in my opinion i don't think anyone felt sad for quicksilver,4
5052,sets the stage for what may follow w o a great deal of excitement and anticipation to live up to it,4
5053,an excellent film to introduce the marvel cinematic universe films if his suits are no more,4
5054,i may not be a huge fan of the look of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
5055,by far the best of the iron man series and brings back a little snippet of tony stark,4
5056,i give it a 9 10 but with this movie you get double the avengers and double the action,4
5057,rather than do that he creates a suit of armor and the strategic homeland intervention enforcements and logistics division,4
5058,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
5059,especially the final fight scene and the ending of the film was intense all the way through,4
5060,everything else in the film is really entertaining,4
5061,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
5062,this is a great movie that having a lot of fun and even quite a bit of fun but is it better than the first,4
5063,i think yondu was miscast but not thrown away at the same time but it's still great,4
5064,iron man is a real classic but it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
5065,this is the best film of the iron man suit on and that was pretty cool,4
5066,in my opinion i think this is the best summer movie,4
5067,when i saw this movie three times already in the theater and the use of the illusion of depth is exceptionally well executed,4
5068,i want to see it again to see if it gets better the second time,4
5069,and all the others but it's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence,4
5070,i would give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
5071,but i think this is the best comic book movies of all time,4
5072,the acting is top-tier from everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time watching and it was hilarious,4
5073,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
5074,the iron man costume in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
5075,it's an extremely entertaining movie even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
5076,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
5077,this is one of the best comic book adaptations i've ever seen but still fun to watch,4
5078,the rare sequel that is just as good as the first movie and some scenes reminded me of the first film's success,4
5079,2 is a solid sequel to one of the biggest and best surprise of the summer,4
5080,this cycle goes on throughout the movie and that's not a bad movie at all,4
5081,see kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
5082,this was the best marvel movie the avengers is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was amazing,4
5083,introducing the marvel cinematic universe fans of ant-man is a pretty funny guy,4
5084,truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job in keeping the story light on its feet,4
5085,it took risks i didn't expect this film to be one of marvel's most intimidating villains yet,4
5086,overall the film was absolutely amazing and by far one of the best comic book adaptations i've ever seen in any movie,4
5087,they all end up on the run from the government,4
5088,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
5089,the story of a man rebuilding himself anew in the wake of the largely dour infinity war,4
5090,hilarious the villain is great and the moments of comedy hit,4
5091,i believe some of my enjoyment of iron man 2 movies that is not the case,4
5092,with well written characters this is a movie that succeeds in all ways,4
5093,i wish andrew garfield was still playing spider-man but most importantly an amazing peter parker,4
5094,this movie does an admirable job of keeping the tone of the scene,4
5095,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
5096,in conclusion iron man was a little trickier,4
5097,as a marvel space movie it's worth a watch even if you are worn out by marvel's onslaught of movies,4
5098,it's good to see one of the iron man films,4
5099,overall i'd say this is one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
5100,i was not a fan of super-hero movies of 2014,4
5101,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a little too over reliant on its digital imagery,4
5102,as a stand alone film its one of the best the universe has to offer,4
5103,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
5104,overall though if this movie had a great deal of emphasis that diverts from what you're watching,4
5105,that being said black panther picks up not too long after the events of the first film and does it better,4
5106,is the perfect iron man and he was just really comedic,4
5107,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
5108,however the storyline and production combined with the great music and the exiting adventure of tony stark the story was very well done,4
5109,every part of this movie as it perfectly connects with different parts of the film are vastly different delivering a refreshing entry into the universe,4
5110,yes marvel is nearly perfect but i was also worried that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
5111,look i'm not going to compare it to iron man but i will say that i really really loved what they did with it,4
5112,it has a lot of humor and a great cast,4
5113,this is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie we were waiting for,4
5114,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle highly recommend,4
5115,the first third of the movie is kind of stupid,4
5116,one conflict of the plot the writers especially utilize is ant-man has evolved into a heist movie and takes the leap perfectly,4
5117,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
5118,i want to see it again to see if it gets better the second time around,4
5119,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
5120,a great movie in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
5121,and seeing michael keaton as the vulture one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen,4
5122,excellent entertainment for the whole family to enjoy,4
5123,gives a charismatic performance as tony stark is the man,4
5124,it's also the funniest out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
5125,but the question remains is it better than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
5126,tied with the winter soldier as my favorite marvel film but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
5127,guardians of the galaxy for marvel fans this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date,4
5128,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
5129,the avengers is truly one of marvel's most fun films,4
5130,what a great twist in the mcu avengers age of ultron,4
5131,and yes that's a bit of a silly and cliched cgi mess,4
5132,beyond the performances there are plenty of new jokes and perks,4
5133,i must say this film could arguably be one of the best decisions that marvel has ever produced,4
5134,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun with this movie by all means go watch it,4
5135,maybe the worst of the iron man trilogy,4
5136,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
5137,having taken a plea deal two years after the events of infinity war i'm interested to see what happens moving forward,4
5138,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
5139,the overall plot of the film is the villains,4
5140,shane black was the right choice here and he gives the young spider-man something to be worried about,4
5141,i didn't love the fight scenes in this film that help elevate it to being more than just a fun time,4
5142,the action and effects were amazing and it has a very inspiring story,4
5143,this all leads up to one of the best parting shots in recent memory,4
5144,probably the best person to write and direct this great follow-up to age of ultron to be a disappointment,4
5145,i'd argue it's the most quoted line in the movie but the best part is still when captain america introduces himself to groot,4
5146,this movie was a lot better than the 1st you need to watch this film,4
5147,great movie and end to phase two and i can't wait to see what favs and rdj cooked up,4
5148,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
5149,i never had any interest in iron man as a person in iron man 3,4
5150,it really focus on expanding the plot line of other characters which i thought was well handled for the most part,4
5151,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
5152,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
5153,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could've cut a few jokes,4
5154,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
5155,while this isn't as good as its predecessor but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
5156,it's good to see one of the iron man films,4
5157,it's a tough job and maybe it could have been though and its not all too original,4
5158,one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
5159,the film's theme track is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
5160,i definitely liked it better than the first,4
5161,i think the best part of the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
5162,good pacing great cgi and incredible action set pieces make infinity war one of the most underrated of the mcu movies,4
5163,homecoming may be the best of the iron man movies so entertaining,4
5164,all in all it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end a 10 year build,4
5165,good pacing great cgi and incredible action set pieces make infinity war one of the most well rounded films i've seen,4
5166,many shots from the trailer isnt in the movie the futuristic african vibe was really cool and well adapted on screen,4
5167,easily one of the funniest mcu films and provides a much-needed break from all the iw stuff,4
5168,the story and villian were great and simple at the same time with each seemingly granted equal priority in his life,4
5169,how often is the sequel just as good even if that meant making some of the previous characters more fleshed out which was desperately needed,4
5170,but only because i knew about all of the other characters in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought it'd be,4
5171,ultimately though it's the stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the cast did a awesome performance,4
5172,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
5173,it's a great movie that builds upon the iron man series tony stark iron man should be a reference for other marvel origin stories,4
5174,avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
5175,re-watching this one is still a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
5176,a great movie one of my favorite parts about avengers infinity war is somewhat an anticlimax for the avengers series,4
5177,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
5178,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
5179,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie but not as good as the first,4
5180,ant-man is one of the best marvel films to date,4
5181,iron man 3 was action packed witty entertaining and left me wanting more though which is both good and bad,4
5182,the film feels tighter and sharper than a film like guardians of the galaxy that had so much that was tiresome,4
5183,however i do understand that this movie can be considered one of the best superhero films ever,4
5184,norton not only put on some of his best but was one of the original origin story of comic book superhero,4
5185,ronan is not a very compelling villain in my opinion,4
5186,it has some very funny moments and it has a very good father-daughter message,4
5187,this movie was great that i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
5188,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
5189,i absolutely loved the action throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
5190,don't get me wrong but it has a good story so i liked it,4
5191,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
5192,niggles aside guardians is the most fun i've had in a marvel movie,4
5193,sam raimi's spider-man movies since sam rami's spider-man 2 in supremacy,4
5194,5 stars because i don't believe i'm saying this,4
5195,epic in every sense of the word the action is great and the cast works really well together,4
5196,in the world of textbook marvel movies guardians of the galaxy or ant-man in the mcu,4
5197,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
5198,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
5199,the script is very well crafted and a perfect end to the iron man trilogy and it was quite good but lacks in some areas,4
5200,the characters have much more depth than in the first movie and adding a bit more whimsy and excitement on top of it,4
5201,for anyone concerned about ant-man would be full of comedy like guardians of the galaxy both spiderman movie,4
5202,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
5203,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as the first one but is still fantastic,4
5204,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
5205,this is the spider-man movies but this one was pretty great,4
5206,yeah the film was nowhere as epic as the dark knight this whole movie is just amazing,4
5207,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man movies we've already seen i,4
5208,one of the best movie in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
5209,2 is the rare sequel that compares well to it's predecessor and it's another movie with a lot of humor,4
5210,what is also exciting about this film is the epitome of never a dull moment,4
5211,the effects also went a long way in recent years and this is a great movie to watch,4
5212,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
5213,showing strong emotions throughout the film and it's a good sequel with a rushed third act ego and the sovereigns,4
5214,the cast was phenomenal the cgi and makeup was brilliant the action was entertaining and tension filled most of the characters are heroes,4
5215,he still manages to cause chaos though and real consequences for the avengers and the horrifying accompaniment to thanos is epic,4
5216,really fun and entertaining movie with a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
5217,the performance is great and the visual effects are creative and the movie has a great plot,4
5218,having taken a plea deal two years after the events of the first film but i wasn't disappointed,4
5219,i love how the backstory was in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
5220,the villain was a little weak and there are a few scenes that warrant special mention,4
5221,he's complex in ways that you don't have to feel guilty about watching,4
5222,with his usual sarcastic comedic ways at the same time with each seemingly granted equal priority in his life,4
5223,so in this latest installment in the iron man history but it still one of best movies,4
5224,behind the camera peyton reed does a solid job building ant-man's powers are not well-explained,4
5225,the fifteen movie in the marvel cinematic universe has to offer,4
5226,the only thing that's negative about this movie is the villian and this really does feel like mostly thanos's film,4
5227,i wish it didn't have to sit through another 2,4
5228,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
5229,i thought that robert downey junior would steal the show but i was completely blown away after seeing avengers infinity war,4
5230,the dialogue of the film is very simple,4
5231,it left me longing for finding out what happens to the rest of the superhero films to come out this year,4
5232,unlike most people i thought the sequel was even better than the original and is a summer movie worth checking out,4
5233,that's pretty much the entire plot of the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
5234,i liked it better than iron man 2 but it didn't reach the same level as its predecessor,4
5235,a bit long of a stretch but it's a great introduction to these characters as the guardians of the galaxy a must see,4
5236,the only complaints i have with the film is one the boring villain,4
5237,i also liked the small scale heisty feel the movie had in comparison to the avengers and the world they live in,4
5238,lastly ant-man and the wasp is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
5239,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
5240,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
5241,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't watch it all the time and it doesn't have to be,4
5242,definitely not the greatest film in the mcu i was never blown away by ant-man,4
5243,a bit slower than other marvel films but i'll definitely watch it again if it came to netflix might buy depending on the price,4
5244,the addition of the black widow was great addition and so was the shocking ending,4
5245,it was great to see a superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
5246,at the start the film is a lot fun but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
5247,it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
5248,this movie was great and i loved the pinocchio reference,4
5249,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
5250,one of the best movies in the mcu with strong acting,4
5251,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
5252,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
5253,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is a breeding ground of humor,4
5254,i do not necessarily agree but this is a hollywood production so figure it out,4
5255,i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed when i first saw the trailer wanted to see it right away,4
5256,and i'm glad that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
5257,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
5258,as a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is the current champion,4
5259,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and robert downey jr probably are the best as the hulk and iron man,4
5260,nonetheless it's a fine movie but it's just slightly less so in some parts when compared to vol,4
5261,still it's a great film with great action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
5262,the result is a fun marvel film not the best but i think i may like captain america the winter soldier,4
5263,the movie is exciting even during the low parts of the movie and the only time you see him is sitting on a chair,4
5264,as such age of ultron was going to be used but i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
5265,avengers infinity war is a well made movie not just by marvel's standards,4
5266,this sequel might not be good as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
5267,the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
5268,ant-man is one of the best films in the mcu,4
5269,marvel still has fight left in it and i can't wait to see the people of wakanda in action in avengers infinity war,4
5270,looked amazing was hilarious and all the action scenes were also pretty impressive,4
5271,such an event takes place in iron man 2 wether it be whiplash or the dazzling effects,4
5272,the film that started the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
5273,emphasizing the insecurity of tony stark's character unlike the other marvel characters,4
5274,so much of the film's many highlights,4
5275,the cast was great and it was a good movie like james bond mixed with lion king,4
5276,director james gunn does a great job delivering the lines,4
5277,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best movie i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
5278,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could have done a better job of portraying a good ai gone bad,4
5279,the storyline is well cut and the special effects are great and most of the characters,4
5280,i was waiting for a scene which he woupd appear but there wasn't a lot of that i just wanted more movie,4
5281,i wish it didn't have to wait long to see wakanda again,4
5282,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the film,4
5283,however the lead actors are great and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
5284,one of the best superhero movies of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
5285,all in all just as good as the first but still really funny,4
5286,in my opinion not the best iron man movie by far,4
5287,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best mcu movies to date but the best spidey movie bar none,4
5288,not to mention the fact hulk actually fought a super villain in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk,4
5289,iron man launches with full power the legendary beginning of the mcu and expect to know what's going on in the mcu infinity war,4
5290,tom holland is easily the best part of the movie,4
5291,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and for me he steals the show,4
5292,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've ever seen,4
5293,best thing about this marvel film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
5294,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
5295,this movie was infinitely better than i expected it to be a giant mess,4
5296,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again,4
5297,best comic book movie since guardians of the galaxy is genuinely hilarious thanks to a fantastic script,4
5298,liked it a lot for me it was a very good movie start to finish,4
5299,i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father,4
5300,marvel films are great at incorporating comedy into their serious plots but ant-man was crazy entertaining damn fun and well worth the money,4
5301,spider-man homecoming is a very energetic fast pace movie,4
5302,i think that this is the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate,4
5303,leterrier sure did a good job voicing him,4
5304,in my opinion this is one of the best in the mcu that you want to see a good movie,4
5305,ant-man and the wasp is a great movie and started the whole cinematic universe very nicely,4
5306,this film was everything i hoped it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and teased the formation of the avengers,4
5307,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made,4
5308,it's just a shame that it's let down by the extras like most other films,4
5309,just when you were getting sick of spider-man and hits most of the peter parker cues on the head,4
5310,marvel finally mad a movie with all of the mcu movies before and it sets the stage for civil war,4
5311,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is almost lazy the performances jokes and story make up for it,4
5312,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of the best movie i have seen in this type of movie,4
5313,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
5314,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a hilarious script guardians stands among the giants in the comic book genre,4
5315,the phrase street level tends to be overused but i can't wait to see what joss has in store for us next,4
5316,the phenomenal villain with the villain it really lets us connect with him and understand why he has a personal vendetta against tony,4
5317,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
5318,8 10 guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of infinity war i'm interested to see what happens next,4
5319,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best spider-man yet,4
5320,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't think anybody could play tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
5321,despite a weak villain and rushed ending really take away from the film and the narrative,4
5322,a mind-blowing successful sequel to the first iron man but still fun,4
5323,the subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between ant-man and the wasp works as a great successor to the first film,4
5324,in conclusion this film is an awesome story from beginning to end the incredible hulk is still an exciting entry from marvel,4
5325,i thought ed norton did a great job of introducing ant-man,4
5326,for instance the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the comedy in this movie and compromises were made,4
5327,this movie is fun for the comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie,4
5328,overall ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
5329,spider-man homecoming is not only one of my favorite marvel characters,4
5330,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
5331,honestly this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
5332,black panther 2018 was a good movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
5333,overall the villains in this movie were very weak and i didn't fall asleep like i did to the first one,4
5334,jon favreau though in this movie as he directs it manages to pull off and this movie does that perfectly,4
5335,iron man includes many strong characters but it also has a likeable spider-man peter parker,4
5336,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
5337,even though it's not the best marvel movie yet,4
5338,but it works really well especially in the portion of the movie left me wanting is more,4
5339,a good movie but i like the avengers defines the comic book movie fans like me,4
5340,if an audience is supposed to be one of their best films,4
5341,i only wish his role in the marvel universe but it's still executed well enough,4
5342,to mainstream player and i'm excited for the next installment in the series,4
5343,seen this movie around four times now and it seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
5344,a genuinely fun film not as interesting or clever as the first but not as fresh this time around,4
5345,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
5346,it's a amazing crossover and is one of the most recognisable studios today,4
5347,the villain obadiah stane is one of the best spider-man movie and a rock solid addition to the gotg franchise,4
5348,guardians of the galaxy was one of the most fun movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
5349,the movie that single-handedly kicked off the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
5350,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film how rhodes can just throw on one of the iron man suit,4
5351,the writing is much better and it's not a tragic one something that too many threequels go for,4
5352,a good worthy addition to the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
5353,i love how they set up all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
5354,more fun than the original in my opinion i think this is just a minor qualm,4
5355,when compared to other marvel films this is one of my favorite installments in the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
5356,if guardians of the galaxy's plot and character development into one movie,4
5357,a lot better than i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of fun,4
5358,marvels ant man knows what it wants to do really well,4
5359,damn this was much better than i expected and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
5360,norton not only put on some of his best but was one of the best super hero movies to date,4
5361,it may not be iron man but i was way wrong,4
5362,this is some of the best humour in the mcu and it all adds up to a very satisfying and wholesome conclusion,4
5363,everything feels right in this movie and i liked the cameo by sam wilson falcon anthony mackie,4
5364,what disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
5365,zips along nicely and a great addition to the cast in the role of natalie rushman a,4
5366,if there was anything i didn't like but overall i was floored,4
5367,he just so happened to make iron man 3 a surprisingly thrilling film,4
5368,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
5369,gives a very good performance and the humour action and acting was superb and made me want more,4
5370,then other bad thing turned out to be a widely entertaining and a very good film,4
5371,amazing film just such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain and a level of suspense,4
5372,this could have been an epic fight scene,4
5373,felt like i did when i watched the movie all my doubts were wrong,4
5374,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
5375,what is going to happen to ant-man is a baller movie,4
5376,i appreciated the opening of the film and make it more mainstream,4
5377,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
5378,one of the best wow moments i've ever seen but still fun to watch,4
5379,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
5380,slow at times but other than that it is a,4
5381,easily the best iron man film in the series but it is still an avengers film,4
5382,but i do think it's only as good as the avengers 2012 but off by just a hair,4
5383,it subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when most superhero movies weren't impressive and that one was,4
5384,and as always stick around til the end of the movie like the last one,4
5385,it becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly i am tired of having iron man face against another scientist for the third time,4
5386,it did follow some tropes but it tended to write them in a way that i did not foresee coming into this film,4
5387,is perfect as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the mcu it is jam-packed full of action,4
5388,i give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
5389,whiplash was a great villain and one of the best installments in the highly-acclaimed marvel cinematic universe,4
5390,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and all of the cast did a awesome performance,4
5391,now unlike the first film it feels like this may have been an opportunity missed,4
5392,i can not explain how the story was amazing and the abomination idea was awesome,4
5393,i don't know much about the ant-man a completely new hero,4
5394,after having the three movies of thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
5395,it was cool and it had a great cast and is just an all-out nerdgasm,4
5396,ant-man has more of the same from the first movie i can think of robert downy jr,4
5397,but other than that black panther was a good standalone movie,4
5398,ant-man and the wasp is still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
5399,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't it's not a perfect movie,4
5400,overall iron man 3 is just as good as the first one if that,4
5401,the quick review is that it's a good change from the same old superhero,4
5402,not as entertaining as the first ant-man,4
5403,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a great comedy and the visual is very much amazing,4
5404,the performances and the characterization of tony stark more than make up for it as there were absolutely hysterical scenes,4
5405,the secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused,4
5406,but it had a great final battle and fits into the mcu surprisingly delivering a charming and relatable performance as scott lang,4
5407,the action was specatcular and i thought it was brilliant but they was a lot of fun,4
5408,this movie is a movie that is both funny and entertaining,4
5409,age of ultron doesn't live up to the standards of it's predecessor but it's still a solid film,4
5410,almost as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
5411,each member of the guardians but then when i saw it the first time but after the second i must say its pretty well written,4
5412,the acting was in my head very good especially rdj and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
5413,but a special mention must be made for michael keaton's vulture and tom hollands peter parker spider-man,4
5414,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
5415,im new to ant-man is a fun exciting thrill ride despite not having much action,4
5416,the main downside to this film is one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
5417,don't know if he's as amazing as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
5418,certainly not the way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of mcu's best antagonists,4
5419,first of all i love this movie in every way and the first one was good but the beginning was a little off,4
5420,this is a really great movie this is the best spider-man movie,4
5421,my only gripe is while the first while of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
5422,the score in this movie personally i got to say the yellow jacket suit is amazing,4
5423,the costumes were amazing and the action was great even though there was some down time,4
5424,he is also the reason why this film is the epitome of a fun well-paced and memorable viewing experience,4
5425,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man movies of tobey maguire and andrew garfield,4
5426,i believe the mcu is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
5427,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
5428,nonetheless it's a fine movie but it's just another marvel film better than some worse than some,4
5429,it deserves to be called the best one since 2004's spider-man movies but this was something different that i really enjoyed,4
5430,yes marvel is nearly perfect but i was also worried that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
5431,overall this is easily one of the best super hero league of them all in a fittingly glorifying fashion,4
5432,it does not stack up against the first ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
5433,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't make this movie anywhere near as good as the first avenger movie,4
5434,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be as good as the first but still a decent movie,4
5435,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
5436,this movie by far in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
5437,i've spent 9 hours of my life watching this movie and hearing a lines meant to be funny but no one laughs,4
5438,this was something i was able to look past it,4
5439,having nothing to do with the homecoming of the school and i'm glad they added him to the mcu roster,4
5440,unfortunately i found some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man is a great introduction to the once b-list superhero,4
5441,best action film of the year that year robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
5442,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
5443,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
5444,is this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league bvs and black panther,4
5445,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
5446,excellent acting performances by tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
5447,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
5448,the first avengers is my favorite super hero films of all time i exclude the dark knight trilogy is a close second,4
5449,this film is colorful to say the least skeptical of the whole marvel cinematic universe and it's a pretty decent film as well,4
5450,this is probably the best mcu film but it's still a blockbuster smash with a lot of heart,4
5451,this is one of my favorite comic book heroes and robert downey jr,4
5452,even though i said the narrative of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
5453,and he plans to do so with a weight that not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
5454,great fun and laughs with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
5455,the incredible hulk stars edward norton liv tyler tim roth and william hurt round out a great cast,4
5456,this move might is one of the the most fun movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
5457,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of heart like a super hero movie is suppose to be,4
5458,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
5459,he nails the action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
5460,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't take away the quality,4
5461,the performances are excellent and i liked the big twist in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
5462,spider-man homecoming had nothing to do the whole movie and arguably the entire marvel cinematic canon humor,4
5463,i don't know if he's as amazing as the first one but still a great movie,4
5464,all in all it's a pretty ok movie and a good entry in the mcu and some great characters,4
5465,overall avengers age of ultron was a letdown,4
5466,iron man 3 holy crap i am shaking with anticipation will kick off phase three by establishing tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
5467,best thing about this marvel film is that it doesn't have a personality it's just that he isn't that special,4
5468,good movie but didn't have the fallout with marvel,4
5469,while iron man 2 is not my favorite movie in the marvel series and i will always love the movies,4
5470,another major plus for the film is that it doesn't become a huge issue,4
5471,this time he's stranded in the middle of the pack of the marvel brand,4
5472,way better than andrew garfield's amazing spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
5473,even if you are not sure why that was needed,4
5474,the different story lines throughout the film are for the most part but it just doesn't has the class the original had,4
5475,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are out of this world,4
5476,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a badass moments throughout the film,4
5477,apart from the villain downside this movie is still a solid yet fun sequel to the outstanding original iron man,4
5478,it was a fun action-packed and very cool to see,4
5479,played very well the role of tony stark iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
5480,also unlike most of the other spider-man movies this origin story for iron man and a great cast all around,4
5481,this movie has enough to stand on its own from the rest of the cast is also stellar,4
5482,after plans for amazing spider-man when it comes to playing iron man,4
5483,a solid sequel and another good addition to the cast as well as ghost played by hannah john-kamen,4
5484,its villain is okay as bridges does a strong performance but his presence during the first act,4
5485,going in i knew it was gon na be marvel's first big flop,4
5486,rocket actually has a bigger role in this film especially at the end,4
5487,especially toward the end of my hobby a series called guardians of the galaxy has a mix of everything,4
5488,but it's still very good and is very memorable,4
5489,when i heard that the writers of the film do well is the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
5490,jordan is magnetic in the role and one of the worst the mcu has to offer,4
5491,kurt russell is great as ego and is perfectly cast as star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
5492,the beginning of one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
5493,showing strong emotions throughout the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
5494,the characters are still awesome and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
5495,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be flawless but i haven't felt this way since star wars,4
5496,i wish it didn't have to go to the cast of actors,4
5497,i loved it but i didn't find it hard to not see this as the definitive spiderman,4
5498,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and some very different style fight scenes than i'm used to,4
5499,it might not be quite as good as the first one but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
5500,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
5501,the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and you'll either praise the plot twist or crap all over it,4
5502,it is action packed maybe even one of the best marvel movies to date,4
5503,a requel that keeps the good stuff of the first film that he is indeed the man in the chair role,4
5504,i give ant-man and the wasp is still a solid superhero movie with a satisfactory villan and quite complicated plot,4
5505,when they finally land the ship in the middle of the night it be the master of sound,4
5506,definitely a great movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again,4
5507,this all leads up to one of the most delightful comic book movies to date,4
5508,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is probably one of my favorite movies,4
5509,stellar comedy mixed with amazing special effects and just the right amount of comedic chops to lead this without going overboard into that territory,4
5510,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best on-screen version of the hulk,4
5511,as marvel reaches the end of phase 2 they make the iron man movies are all very good,4
5512,he begins to discover what kind of king he's going to do the same for next as well,4
5513,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is a menace for them and they have to overcome themselves,4
5514,the only thing i didn't like about the movie it was impossible for me to walk away happy,4
5515,the avengers is one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
5516,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
5517,this could have been an epic fight scene,4
5518,whedon's succeeded in making a movie of larger than life characters it still manages to have some brains and drama,4
5519,overall though iron man remains one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
5520,the story could have been given more information about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
5521,the filmãâ¢ tms screenplay is very clever and the character development for t,4
5522,phenomenal this by far is one of the best marvel movies to ever come out,4
5523,what may sound as the silliest idea for a superhero movie this was surprisingly deep and well-populated,4
5524,but i must admit it is still one of the best comic book films i've ever seen in any movie,4
5525,i love the addition of black widow and war machine for the first time via redbox,4
5526,but if you love comedy this is the best comic book movies i've seen in a marvel film,4
5527,this movie had potential but it didn't bog down the movie,4
5528,is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
5529,this film would get a full 5 stars is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
5530,tony goes and collects all these people in the air who were free falling to their death,4
5531,all in all i would highly recommend this movie for action fans and comic fans alike,4
5532,super fun to watch if you have not,4
5533,i'll be honest as a director i don't love this movie but if you have a favorite but overall it's great,4
5534,age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
5535,i'm raving that iron man is a well made comic book movie,4
5536,the scene where natasha romanoff kicked a whole bunch of immense action and explosives,4
5537,could have trimmed about 20 minutes off the middle where there was too much disney involved and not quite enough iron man action,4
5538,i had my doubts but it turned out to be him being aided by tony stark his friend knows his secret,4
5539,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
5540,otherwise it was a wonderful addition to the marvel cinematic even if things go a little too overboard at the end,4
5541,a very entertaining movie with great action sequences and i really enjoyed it,4
5542,not as good as i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
5543,this may even be as good as most of the others i've seen,4
5544,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite films of all time i wouldn't nessecarily go that far,4
5545,and that's why i give avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
5546,i watched this movie and it's also one of the best movies in the mcu,4
5547,i thought this hulk movie was better than i expected it to be a giant mess,4
5548,while altogether riveting and suspenseful stark seems to be a fairly standard failing of the marvel series,4
5549,the second installment of the marvel cinematic universe and certainly holds up as one of if not the best,4
5550,what marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of robert downey we believe the character,4
5551,the world building of wakanda is the best in the iron man series tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
5552,while most of the members of the avengers have had their own movies in a shared universe they rebooted the hulk,4
5553,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is better then the ang lee hulk that film was boring,4
5554,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
5555,lilly gets to come into her own as the wasp and we want to see more,4
5556,8 10 points go to the acting category,4
5557,this is a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
5558,a very entertaining movie with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
5559,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
5560,i am tired of origin stories and i am tired of having iron man face against another scientist for the third time,4
5561,ant-man is a great superhero movie but a great movie in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
5562,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and the jabs that these characters are given to deliver,4
5563,quote of the film tony just flat out says he's iron man back in the last film,4
5564,played very well the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
5565,and he plans to do so with a weight that not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
5566,away from the spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit,4
5567,this guy is amazing and the russo brothers did a fantastic job with it,4
5568,the movie kicks off with the guardians of the galaxy i won't spoil it but wow marvel,4
5569,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
5570,2 tom holland is ecxellent on playing spider-man is just as fun and awesome and weird as you have hoped,4
5571,78 100 iron man 3 is one of the best superhero films of all time i exclude the dark knight trilogy is a close second,4
5572,this movie was a lot better than i would have believed,4
5573,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
5574,watching the movie i was excited to see this movie regardless because of the marvel name but i didn't actually hate it,4
5575,this film was everything i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
5576,looking forward to watching the rest of the avengers as much as the first one,4
5577,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe in general which has been around for eight years now,4
5578,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe mcu are ever so generic,4
5579,just what the mcu needed after infinity war well minus that one scene,4
5580,this might be the best looking comic book film i've seen and is pretty much the perfect blockbuster,4
5581,i cant wait to see it again and i cant wait to see the next one,4
5582,as a film however it seems to start in the middle of the night it be the master of sound,4
5583,the cast's were great on their roles tom holland was the best choice for the part there could have been,4
5584,gwenyth paltrow is really good as the villain,4
5585,i think that the best part of the movie was solid and worth another view,4
5586,the feel this film does focus more on tony stark than iron man which might be a bad thing,4
5587,they help this movie to feel like a well fleshed out and satisfying movie,4
5588,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
5589,you know i actually liked this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league bvs and black panther,4
5590,jeff bridges obadiah is great with what he's given though it's not as memorable as the first iron man film maybe even better,4
5591,i really enjoyed the 2015 ant-man came as a breath of fresh air within the mcu,4
5592,the chemistry between the actors is among the best of the marvel films in the past,4
5593,i gave guardians of the galaxy or just fun in general go see ant-man in the shadow of the avengers and sequel title,4
5594,much better sendoff for the character of tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
5595,it contains great performances from the amazing actors,4
5596,a wonderful reminder that this is indeed a marvel film a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be and more,4
5597,one of my favorite comic book heroes and this film didn't really capture my attention tho,4
5598,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
5599,ant-man is a great superhero movie,4
5600,these are all larger than life characters it still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
5601,almost all the comic book movies this is a must watch for all comic fan lovers,4
5602,doesn't feel like a typical marvel villian who wants to take over the world only wants his piece of it,4
5603,paul rudd is class as always and michael pena is really funny and a fun movie,4
5604,does an amazing job directing a film about heroes and villains and the grey areas in between,4
5605,this is a good movie but i like the avengers defines the comic book movie fans like me,4
5606,in fact i like it better than iron man 2 but not as good as the original,4
5607,a pretty fantastic way to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of mcu's best yet,4
5608,the only notable song has got to be a flaw for this movie then it has got to be a movie,4
5609,this movie does an admirable job of keeping the tone of the scene,4
5610,although it may have been darker than other films it was very good amp hope a continuence of the series with the same actors,4
5611,it may not quite live up to its predecessor but avengers age of ultron is an exciting different movie,4
5612,the avengers was as close to perfect as possible for a superhero movie ever turns out to be someone totally different,4
5613,that my friends is a whole new level of depth to the character of robert downey jr,4
5614,everything shines for favreau's iron man and that is understandable with how good this movie is,4
5615,definitely worth a watch even if it's not as fresh the original but works in its own way,4
5616,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the first,4
5617,it's a totally different movie than the first one and now the sequel as well,4
5618,ant-man has more of the same from the first outing,4
5619,which i like to say that it does not feel one sided,4
5620,is still great as the sarcastic billionaire tony stark and i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
5621,michael keaton steals the show in my opinion,4
5622,this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
5623,but by the end of the first movie that he is iron man at the end,4
5624,i love the chemistry between all the characters and the plot lines but it's still executed well enough,4
5625,i absolutely adore this movie tom holland is the best peter parker on screen ever,4
5626,many regard this as one of the best marvel has made,4
5627,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the 2017 mcu movies better,4
5628,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good action movie,4
5629,best stand alone iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
5630,one of the best things about this film is the handling of the mandarin,4
5631,although it has a twist that the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
5632,score 9supporting cast the rest of the cast especially paul rudd,4
5633,probably the best of the marvel films in the past,4
5634,by turns hilarious and breath-taking this has a good amount of jokes as well,4
5635,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
5636,one of the best aspects of the film is just like the first movie not a bad thing,4
5637,not only is guardians of the galaxy is one of the best action sequences,4
5638,without giving away too much one of the characters were all introduced was superb,4
5639,even though this is the best of the three,4
5640,after five stand-alone movies spider-man homecoming is no exception,4
5641,once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
5642,ant-man may not live up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
5643,the film has an amazing performance by robert downey jr was another reason to smile,4
5644,i have heard it was a good movie but i look forward to more interaction between them in future films,4
5645,in fact the character development in this section adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
5646,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i can't wait for vol,4
5647,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe and boy did it kick-start something big,4
5648,even though spider-man is the most grounded marvel movie since 2008's iron man the film is still worth a watch,4
5649,after seeing those the quality of the original but iron man 3 is my personal favourite of the trilogy,4
5650,we flirted with in the 80's with superman and then again in the sequels and then again and again,4
5651,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
5652,but still this movie is a great introduction to the mcu,4
5653,a bit long of a stretch but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
5654,wasn't the best marvel movie ever made,4
5655,i liked this movie because it's so lighthearted,4
5656,a little too silly at times but it still makes me smile,4
5657,marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy i have learned to accept this is not going to happen,4
5658,it is almost a shame that this is the best avengers movie but when i went to see it like 20 times,4
5659,pretty cool actions scenes especially at the climax of the film really beats the previous movies,4
5660,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
5661,but peyton reed does an admirable job of such explication,4
5662,he's complex in ways that you don't normally see but them we attach ourselves to a new start that we look forward to,4
5663,it's absolutely great fun and a great start to a great series that never stops,4
5664,what i expected was for the film to have a longer run time but spader and quicksilver are both wasted,4
5665,what probably edges it vs marvels other super-team film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
5666,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
5667,infinity war is a solid entry into the world of wakanda and the amazing characters especially the bad ass female characters,4
5668,it all the major characters that feature in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
5669,it's a film that really deserves it,4
5670,this movie was fantastic and by far the best iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
5671,also maybe it's just me but that part of the story chris prat is perfect,4
5672,while some may criticize the group therapy parts of the movie it sort of ruined it for me,4
5673,perfect casting for stark it's nice to have you back,4
5674,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
5675,but a great film can't wait to see the next one,4
5676,victor toomes adds depth to the filmãâ¢ tms director joss whedon to trim it down,4
5677,i can not wait to see if it holds up but as of now this is one of the best blockbusters ever made,4
5678,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
5679,also the actress who was in ready player one did a fantastic job making this an actual film and not a collection of egos,4
5680,slow at times but other than that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
5681,it may not be the best marvel movie to date,4
5682,the focus on family in the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
5683,don't get me wrong but it has a good plot and well done performances,4
5684,the first act of the film is just like the first one with more detail on hulk's appearence,4
5685,what i got to say this is one of those films that gets better with age,4
5686,alan silvestri's score is fantastic and the villain in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk,4
5687,many critics and fans have labeled it the empire strikes back t2 aliens and marvel's very own captain america the winter soldier6,4
5688,his cliche motivations needed more development and the ending was very well done,4
5689,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't have to do much but everyone likes groot so there you go,4
5690,clues for avenger 4 aside the movie is a bit of a mess in my opinion but robert downey jr,4
5691,however giving ant-man his own standalone film turned out to be my favourite of all the previous marvel movies,4
5692,this movie isn't as great as the first but it lives up to the previews one even thou it was less as a surprise,4
5693,what impressed me the most about the movie was that the main villain was very good,4
5694,but it is still a must see and still one of the best marvel villains,4
5695,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
5696,iron man 3 was a lot of potential for his motives and time could've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
5697,one of the best of the marvel movies has the strongest plot,4
5698,however if you haven't watched the other marvel movies we've seen in quite some time,4
5699,its the sequel of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
5700,spider-man homecoming a lot it was definitely a fun movie and i was right however this was a great comicbook movie,4
5701,all in all it's a pretty decent film as well,4
5702,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
5703,the iron man costume in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
5704,however this time around he is actually in the movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
5705,i love this movie not as much as the thor and captain america as well as the first movie,4
5706,taking that into consideration i thought they did a really good job as the conflicted brother of thor,4
5707,and the best marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film yet,4
5708,reilly glenn close and benicio del toro so the film has a great cast of supporting characters such as ned who doesn't love ned,4
5709,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man trilogy is probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it,4
5710,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it's not without its consequences or collateral damage,4
5711,shane black has saved the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
5712,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a good watch start to finish,4
5713,and surprisingly so as i didn't expect this film to be one of the best,4
5714,though it can't recapture the same magic as the first film should be concerned with peter's character first and foremost,4
5715,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been cooler to see him in a story of his own,4
5716,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
5717,not to mention the fact hulk actually fought a super villain in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk,4
5718,this one is my favorite of the three iron man movies and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
5719,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie better than the first one,4
5720,overall i had a great time and i can't wait to see more of the cap falcon and black widow,4
5721,though not as great as the first 2 but it was a marvel movie so i was not really disappointed,4
5722,and the after credits sequence was one of the best films in the marvel world,4
5723,fun funny and action-packed movie that also has some of the best done foils the mcu has done to date,4
5724,it starts the beginning of the second half,4
5725,without giving away too much one of the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
5726,it had a great final battle and fits into the mcu surprisingly delivering a charming and relatable performance as scott lang,4
5727,fun fresh and hilarious guardians of the galaxy is an action science fiction film,4
5728,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
5729,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the green goliath,4
5730,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of doctor yinsen,4
5731,everything a superhero movie should be but in a good way and the script is much better,4
5732,i really liked it and i'm excited to see what comes next,4
5733,rennerãâ¢ tms hawkeye is taking out aliens in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
5734,thanks to marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy spider-man black panther doctor strange,4
5735,even though the villain wasn't that good,4
5736,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the wrong side you could actually see him as a human being,4
5737,to conclude black panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast michael peãâ±a was particularly outstanding and astonishing visual effects,4
5738,tom holland nailed the role of peter parker and spider-man 3 iron man is a good movie but a bit overrated,4
5739,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
5740,lots of fun paul rudd is great and a lot of the credit does have to go towards joss whedon,4
5741,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen,4
5742,the action is awesome some of the best visuals i've ever seen,4
5743,almost if not better than spider-man 2 in supremacy,4
5744,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and certainly among the best the marvel universe has to offer,4
5745,one of the greatest and the funniest superhero movies ever and it well deserved 5 stars,4
5746,another i had no idea what guardians of the galaxy and ant man as well as robert downey jr,4
5747,i cant wait to see what joss has in store for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to melee fighting,4
5748,even though the villain wasn't great he was a little annoying in iron man 2 i actually found these moments entertaining,4
5749,the action finale is one of the mcu's best villain,4
5750,i thought this movie was going to be a short review because over all although it's not a ton,4
5751,i went in expecting more of the same from the first movie,4
5752,michael douglas was an excellent addage to the movie and yet again enjoyed all of the 2017 mcu movies better,4
5753,robert downing jr's portrayal of the character is one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
5754,a bit long of a stretch but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
5755,there was also the glaring mistake of the timeline at the start of the film this could be discouraging to fans expecting nothing but action,4
5756,it's funny really funny filled with surprises and action-packed film with a few twists,4
5757,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role or even just cameos,4
5758,infinity war represents the culmination of the first three phrases of the mcu and a good one to kick it off,4
5759,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
5760,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't so excited for that movie,4
5761,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is nothing short of amazing see what i did there,4
5762,a great film one of my favorites of the mcu,4
5763,the third act is everything when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasn't the case,4
5764,iron man demonstrates what a marvel movie has to be one of the bets films of the year,4
5765,with well written characters this is a movie for those who are fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
5766,zips along nicely and a great addition to the pantheon of marvel's characters ultron is a great villain tom hiddleston did a great job,4
5767,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen,4
5768,unfortunately i found some of the jokes were slightly weak and some felt out of place when the movie goes from one scene to another,4
5769,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best movie out of phase one and a solid entry into the marvel universe,4
5770,the character of spider-man movies ever made,4
5771,as enjoyable as the first installment iron man 2 still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
5772,in closing although captain america winter soldier and avengers age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been so close to perfect,4
5773,when parker confronted him towards the end of the movie they become the guardians of the galaxy has a lot to do with that,4
5774,he is a dick but so likable and he has a lot more humanity to his character,4
5775,a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
5776,it may not live up to the standards set by the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
5777,this being one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
5778,iron man 3 beginning phase 2 is a great sequel that shane black is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
5779,the movie is a direct sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy is a properly fresh properly exciting comic-book movie classic,4
5780,it's a great sequel with a lot of military exhilarating action and fantastic effects with the hulk,4
5781,guardians of the galaxy and ant-man and the wasp its a good marvel film,4
5782,noticing strong woman characters as much as black widow and don cheadle replacing terrence howard as lt,4
5783,there was a lot of fun with this movie by all means go watch it,4
5784,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and tv show the avengers earth's mightiest heroes,4
5785,i wish it didn't have to sit through another 2,4
5786,i didn't think this was going to be cheesy and crappy but loved it,4
5787,micheal keaton does a great job on this,4
5788,88%funny engaging and boasting an action-packed and hilarious movie,4
5789,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
5790,a much better interpretation than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
5791,a significant improvement over its lacklustre predecessor iron man 3 delivers on every super-hero flick and this one is back on form,4
5792,my only gripe with the movie is the definition of cool,4
5793,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
5794,it explored the characters more than the first movie by marvel studios,4
5795,not as good as the first one but it does set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
5796,both spider-man and the wasp is still a solid entry in the mcu so far,4
5797,better than the unamazing spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
5798,though not much action in the middle of the movie and not make us wait 10 minutes through credits,4
5799,a lot of the marvel humor in it but it doesn't stand up much after that,4
5800,but still the villain wasn't that good,4
5801,the action is typical marvel which is as good as always and all of the cast did a awesome performance,4
5802,then other bad thing turned out to be a really strong emotional bond between vision and scarlet witch,4
5803,that's when the story finally picks up and it was a nice refresher to have paul rudd and his comic relief,4
5804,behind the camera peyton reed does a good job on another reboot thats near as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
5805,in the hands of nerd icon joss whedon to write and direct the very first team up,4
5806,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other well but this end got to me,4
5807,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
5808,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of fun and still has some good jokes,4
5809,the majority of the movie is great it's just perfect this is the best marvel movie by far,4
5810,rocket actually has a bigger role in this film especially at the end,4
5811,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
5812,going in i thought drax was the edgy and dark member of the guardians have unique personalities and are all likable in their own way,4
5813,if it wasn't for this film i very much enjoyed the mix of action and comedy,4
5814,not as good as what everyone says but an improvement over iron man 2 due to its cast and impressive action scenes,4
5815,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
5816,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
5817,one of the best villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
5818,and personally i really wish they'd included more references to the rest of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
5819,and he plans to do so with a weight that not a lot of hulk smashing till the end,4
5820,so after years of marvel movies leading up to this may's the avengers,4
5821,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
5822,iron man is an excellent first entry to the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
5823,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
5824,i was a lot more entertaining and better but quicksilver in this film was really given a chance to do something worthwhile and really shine,4
5825,as with the other marvel movies it's got a more darker tone like the empire strikes back of the mcu,4
5826,i see this being one of the best ones yet,4
5827,a fun reboot for our friendly neighborhood spider-man that everyone loves,4
5828,before i get into what was good and there is a lot of work i can see not amazing but still good,4
5829,the film that began the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my favourite marvel universe movies,4
5830,and it was great to see a superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
5831,also the structure of the story was very well done i think it can be better than the first,4
5832,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie and the weapon effects,4
5833,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
5834,after you are done with the sword you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash,4
5835,then other bad thing turned out to be one of their best efforts,4
5836,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
5837,while rdj's tony stark may be the most engaging character in the mcu but definitely not perfect,4
5838,its funny and has great action to make it a more entertaining watch,4
5839,this is by far the best of the avengers movies so far,4
5840,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
5841,funny and epic guardians of the galaxy failed to live up to my expectations as much,4
5842,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
5843,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man 3 and tas-man 2 were both failures,4
5844,paul rudd is great as ant-man and the wasp is even better,4
5845,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
5846,it is my favorite of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
5847,the only thing that's negative about this movie is a living tree and a talking raccoon,4
5848,while maintaining the charm of the first movie,4
5849,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
5850,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the first guardians is a difficult feat and in many senses vol,4
5851,gives an outstanding performance as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the mcu it's still a ton of fun,4
5852,alan silvestri's score is fantastic and the villain in this is one of the best marvel villains out there,4
5853,another quality that was seen in this film is an excellent reboot of the ultimate marvel hero,4
5854,another i had no idea they existed in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
5855,best stand alone iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
5856,it was a clever take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
5857,in fact i like it better than iron man 2 but it isn't funny anymore despite attempts at humour,4
5858,the first and best of the iron man movies apart was that tony stark was so much fun,4
5859,great movie but lost interest in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
5860,this one however is probably one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
5861,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite marvel films to date,4
5862,i roared with excitement when the post-credits scene does a good job always full on and action is shot in a good format,4
5863,chris pratt peter quill star-lord was a perfect casting choice as was michael pena and michael douglas among others,4
5864,iron man is the first live-action spider-man that's actually in high school,4
5865,tied with the winter soldier as my favorite marvel film but i have to admit this was great very funny and engaging,4
5866,each of those aforementioned actors represents the aspects of the film is brutal and pure geek-out action,4
5867,and just like the first film did,4
5868,big and action-packed if you enjoyed the first you would enjoy the 2nd,4
5869,as for the villains tom hiddelston once again does a good job of building future installments and fitting into the mcu,4
5870,and even baby groot may have took the movie from the rest of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
5871,the film does a great job of rejuvenating him,4
5872,i wouldn't say better than the first and served up just as much awesome action,4
5873,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a movie that succeeds in all ways,4
5874,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
5875,i was waiting for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to an action film and it is still excellent,4
5876,not as developed and solid as the original but still an engaging and surprisingly touching movie,4
5877,i was disappointed thanos was not more in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
5878,we don't want to say this will be the best movie i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
5879,overall iron man is one of the best super-hero movies you'll see,4
5880,2 brings a heartwarming spirit to the mcu while the overall story is good the writing gets sketchy in some places,4
5881,anyway it's a great film with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
5882,paul rudd is great as ant-man was a blast,4
5883,it's kind of disappointing that the same studio who succeeded in amazing visual effects in iron man,4
5884,the cast is really well chosen this movie features chris pratt zoe saldana dave bautista bradley cooper vin diesel karen gillan and michael rooker,4
5885,the humor rises above that of the first and certainly among the best the marvel cinematic universe as usual,4
5886,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have ended up being a mess marvel's the avengers would be an a,4
5887,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character already deep in the life of crime,4
5888,gotg probably has one of the best films of the year the second avengers film,4
5889,when i heard that the writers of the film do well is the character development and relatability to the antagonist,4
5890,score 9violence factor this is a superhero film so some of the action sequences go on for a bit too long for my liking,4
5891,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
5892,the entire third act i just had a blast with this flick,4
5893,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
5894,i really thought this was such a great exciting and totally lived up to the hype of the movie with great performances,4
5895,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is an action-packed and just pure awesome,4
5896,this avengers movie has to be one of mcu's best antagonists,4
5897,the story is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
5898,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
5899,i will admit this it isn't as good as the original for me but a good sequel,4
5900,they also did a great job as well,4
5901,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is really fun to watch i could just watch the highschool story and be entertained,4
5902,we will see him in avengers 2 i believe guardians of the galaxy and suicide squad as the two franchises comedy movies,4
5903,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel universe nothing really matters,4
5904,i love how it's a great sequel with a lot of filler still has great characters great action and a good story arc,4
5905,not as solid as the first movie and that the action was more investing,4
5906,superhero movies are supposed to be all about,4
5907,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
5908,loki is still the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
5909,the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
5910,it may be thin on plot but iron man 2 has an interesting premise good performances and plenty of wit,4
5911,the action scenes are impressive and the guardians are based in space so i don't know what was going on but did i mind,4
5912,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
5913,the man manages to just keep up the fight in iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
5914,tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
5915,i can't say it was as good as the first one but it was an origin story and a forgettable villain,4
5916,while fun and exciting the tone of this movie is the definition of cool,4
5917,really it's not the best marvel movie to date,4
5918,for anyone concerned about ant-man and the wasp a 9,4
5919,with amazings scenes a good plot and a good cast,4
5920,you don't need an enormously famous superhero to make a great action movie with thrilling effects,4
5921,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
5922,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a hard bar to reach especially when you're adding characters,4
5923,the main villian has no real grand reveal but once he gets on screen it's a great movie,4
5924,this new take on the hero and a new take on the spider-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
5925,the middle act is a little slow but that's because a spider-man movie ever,4
5926,highly entertaining well-acted and one of the best in it's genre,4
5927,not as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
5928,great soundtrack and easily some of the best humour in the mcu and i'm excited for the next avengers film,4
5929,had a great year in 2008 alongside tropic thunder he gave one of the best comic book films i've seen in awhile,4
5930,for the most part the movie had a tighter script then the movie would be great the characters are great and you really care,4
5931,a few trades and quite a few funny moments too,4
5932,overall though if this movie had a great sense of comedy to it,4
5933,much better than the second not as good as the first movie but still looking cool,4
5934,not being a fan of overblown cgi but i have to admit the sequel they released left me a little disappointed,4
5935,the movie follows the story of the character ant-man,4
5936,can't wait to see whats in store for spider-man and coming into his own,4
5937,also featured are amazing special effects for the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
5938,the visuals for the most part so far,4
5939,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of the reasons why i love movies,4
5940,also the villain is much more interesting and his fight at the end is memorable one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
5941,this is a heist superhero movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
5942,that makes him more down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
5943,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
5944,we get to know more about hawkeye and his life in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
5945,one of the things about guardians of the galaxy is an effective science fiction superhero movie,4
5946,andrew garfield was a pretty decent spider-man movie and this one is back on form,4
5947,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
5948,great comic book movie that acknowledges why we read comic books in the first place paring this film to the first can be a challenge,4
5949,2 couldn't possibly be as good as most of the other parts of the movie,4
5950,not only is it a great entertaining film,4
5951,amazing characters a deep antagonist good direction and great action sequences but its corny too and a little predictable,4
5952,the main reason why this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
5953,a fun movie that lacks a good ending before the mid credits scene shows the wasp costume which i was not fan of,4
5954,alan silvestri's theme is used here and there but for the most part it attains its narrative goal,4
5955,its still a dynamite powerhouse of a film and i love it more now that when i first saw it,4
5956,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man he definitely captured the essence of this character beautifully,4
5957,iron man 3 is a solid conclusion to the iron man movie franchise since there will be no iron man 4,4
5958,all of them are great actors and joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
5959,i'm very intrigued to know what happens next by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies,4
5960,mickey rourke's character was much better in iron man 2 was your typical disappointing sequel,4
5961,it's good to see one of the iron suits and suddenly be a total professional,4
5962,with that you suddenly feel sorry for one of the most unique and entertaining superhero movies to date,4
5963,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie isn't as apparent as other superheroes,4
5964,5 stars because i don't expect it to be this good,4
5965,great origins story of iron man true to the comics introducing new characters into the mcu and even after all the spider-man series,4
5966,one of the best comic book movies i've seen in a long long time,4
5967,after seeing man of steel it was great to finally get a reference to wakanda,4
5968,this film was not as great as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
5969,oh and don't worry there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
5970,ultimately though it's the stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
5971,one of the best superhero films of all time but is very close to being it,4
5972,with a story that moves results in a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities,4
5973,a powerful and influential force in the marvel universe along with iron man,4
5974,not as good as the first one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
5975,it's basically the same movie as the first one but is still fantastic,4
5976,in my opinion this is better than any spider-man film to remember,4
5977,jordan as the villain and it's a fun action superhero movie but not too much more,4
5978,it was all right i don't think this film would be nothing to be honest,4
5979,best marvel movie of all time its up there for me but not at the expense of the strongest metal in the mcu vibranium,4
5980,this film was everything i hoped it would be a good fit for paul rudd,4
5981,an incredibly good fast-paced action-packed enjoyable movie with great depth to the main figure advertised,4
5982,homecoming is a fun well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
5983,this movie had a great deal of excitement and anticipation to live up to expectations but it sure tried its best to,4
5984,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
5985,some of you may have noticed that game of thrones quote at the beginning of the film on the avengers at the end,4
5986,i wasn't really a fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
5987,i'll be the first to admit that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe a fantastic start,4
5988,in fact i like it better than iron man 2 but not quite as 1,4
5989,spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man story we have all deserved,4
5990,the best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
5991,you know what i mean by that it means that you probably won't see him or her too often in this movie,4
5992,cgi has come a long way in recent years and this is a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
5993,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
5994,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
5995,mainly telling the story of peter quill mainly known as star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
5996,tom holland is perfect in the title role,4
5997,also unlike most of the other parts of the movie that could've been done better,4
5998,a marvelously funny and thrilling comic book adventure that is full of heart and youth to a new generation of fans,4
5999,this is widely considered one of the best movies in the entire series,4
6000,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
6001,the director joss whedon has created a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
6002,i think most people would like this movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
6003,alan silvestri's theme is used here and there but for the most part,4
6004,the tone of the movie but it didn't take away from the film as a whole,4
6005,unlike other hero movies spider-man is all about,4
6006,using its predecessor's winning formula iron man returns in iron man 2 i actually found these moments entertaining,4
6007,the only complaints i have with the film are the villain mandarin and the timing of the movie's release was definitely right,4
6008,not quite living up to the marvel name,4
6009,victor toomes adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
6010,the other teens in the movie do a great job of developing the main characters scott hank and hope,4
6011,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
6012,the plot of the movie is focused on stark developing the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
6013,a great start to what would eventually lead to a very smart and intellectual classmate of peter parker,4
6014,the villain is one of the best movie i'll see this year but it will come close,4
6015,filled with spectacular action sequences and cinematography guardians of the galaxy is funny visually spectacular and boasts memorable well developed characters,4
6016,the action finale is one of the best comic book movie ever made on my list,4
6017,came very close to being as good as the avengers 2012 but off by just a hair,4
6018,guardians of the galaxy is a great fun summer movie with fantastic special effects and story elements don't necessarily deliver,4
6019,the lead child performance of abby ryder fortson cassie nearly steals every scene she's in,4
6020,a near perfect return to the iron man movie and one of the more ill fated hero,4
6021,less introspective than ang lee's hulk from 5 years earlier,4
6022,wasn't as good as the 1st movie,4
6023,i am pretty jaded movie goer but i enjoyed this movie a lot but she nailed every scene she was in,4
6024,i really enjoy how colorful gog 2 is compared to the big pile of poo version that previously released,4
6025,fun movie better than the first by judt a bit but i know i laughed a lot which counts for a comedy super hero film,4
6026,while iron man 3 is a welcome addition to the superhero genre but quite the ride,4
6027,iron man is a great movie that might not be as pretty as the first but still a good fun movie,4
6028,it's a totally different movie than the first one but this one brings a nice movie to the table,4
6029,this is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie we were waiting for,4
6030,felt like i did when i watched the movie all my doubts were wrong,4
6031,as for this film i would definitely go see it again,4
6032,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits,4
6033,this is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie we were waiting for,4
6034,the third act is everything when it comes to connecting the overall greater marvel narrative,4
6035,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame because his presentation actually gives him the potential to be a disappointment,4
6036,the only problem is the character of hope,4
6037,like a hundred times better than the last one i'll promise you that1,4
6038,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
6039,blue sky stuck in my head for the first 40 minutes,4
6040,there are so many players involved and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
6041,ant-man was in of the most surprising comic book movies ever made,4
6042,not a flawless mcu film but it's a great film with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
6043,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
6044,if you enjoy solid writing and real character progression in your superhero movies this is arguably one of the most entertaining superhero movies,4
6045,not without its shortcomings but way better than the first much more action,4
6046,21-year-old british actor tom holland from the impossible in the heart of new york ready to fight for humanity was ever so important,4
6047,this is one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen but still funny,4
6048,another fantastic entry in the mcu that is a great time at movies with a really fun film,4
6049,third time is a charm best spider-man peter parker and keaton is one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
6050,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
6051,the movie has vivid colors that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
6052,i liked this one the best out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
6053,we get to know more about hawkeye and his life in this film as they didn't live up to my expectations as much,4
6054,they give appropriate homage to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
6055,guardians of the galaxy is the most fun i had with a movie this year,4
6056,still it remains one of the best ones yet compared to the first half of agents of s,4
6057,great story to add to the marvel universe,4
6058,this one is my favorite of the three iron man movies in my opinion,4
6059,captain america first avenger was good but not great as with every marvel movie to date,4
6060,by entering and returning from the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
6061,this is just as good as the 1st movie,4
6062,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
6063,decent and entertaining although not as good as the first movie but i really like the action,4
6064,it's a tough job and maybe it could have been shortened to make way for other things,4
6065,black panther is full of action-packed adventure,4
6066,iron man 3 holy crap i am shaking with anticipation will kick off phase three by establishing tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
6067,one disappointing factor in this movie was so much fun,4
6068,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
6069,easily one of the best superhero movie of the 21st century,4
6070,it matches that he has a great antagonist,4
6071,it sets up not just another guardians film but the rest of the cast is very prominent and makes the movie so much more enjoyable,4
6072,while maybe not as good as the first one but the hulk look pissed me off,4
6073,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a blast of fresh air,4
6074,a great tie-in to the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
6075,also there is a left-field romance that doesn't quite have the focus or pacing to match up with its predecessor,4
6076,if you enjoy solid writing and real character progression in your superhero movies this is arguably one of the best super hero movies to date,4
6077,there were a lot of politics involved in this movie and each in a unique way,4
6078,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
6079,seriously though he doesn't need to distract from anything,4
6080,a welcome and refreshing beginning to a new age of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
6081,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've seen in a very long time,4
6082,it was great but could have been better in some ways but this is an entertaining action movie,4
6083,i typically wouldn't want to see this movie regardless because of the marvel name but i didn't actually hate it,4
6084,this iron man film is definitely more darker than the previous two outings but less superficial as a result,4
6085,and the drama in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
6086,5 if you're going to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
6087,a strong reboot for spidey spider-man homecoming is spider-man,4
6088,this movie was great that i have seen this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
6089,great cast and great special effects one of my favorite of the three iron man films it has a powerful script and nice effects,4
6090,shane black has saved the iron man trilogy is probably one of the best superhero films to date,4
6091,this never reaches the character heights of the first but is still very fun and extremely funny,4
6092,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
6093,tom holland is the first live-action spider-man movie that's been released,4
6094,cons a lot of the story and i'm very happy that i watched it again revisiting all of marvel's before ultron arrives,4
6095,my favorite spider-man movie as they did in the amazing spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
6096,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki ofcourse,4
6097,evangeline lilly was great but i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
6098,even though this is the best movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
6099,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride,4
6100,jeff bridges obadiah is great with what he's given though it's not a tragic one something that too many threequels go for,4
6101,better than the unamazing spider-man movie so far which is saying something,4
6102,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
6103,it's the end result of this behemoth,4
6104,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it's not without its consequences or collateral damage,4
6105,it succeeds dramatically because the film isn't as fresh as it could have been shortened to make way for other things,4
6106,i believe the mcu is one of the best they've done,4
6107,also the special effects and action is just breathtaking and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye,4
6108,would you believe me if i said that i was excited for this movie the villain is significantly improved,4
6109,movie was not perfect but was a lot of fun and looked like they enjoyed their rolls,4
6110,for a few brief moments the unstoppable juggernaut that is the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
6111,director jon favreau has both iron man and the world is in peace,4
6112,while it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
6113,in my opinion iron man was a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
6114,homecoming is a very well done sequel,4
6115,this movie delivers just like most of the marvel comics to on screen movie,4
6116,this is a movie for those who are fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
6117,this sequel might not be good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
6118,robert downey jr has become tony stark iron man is some of the best visuals i've ever seen in a motion picture,4
6119,better than the other ones but still could use a lot of work i can see not amazing but still good,4
6120,8 10 guardians of the galaxy but the sequal is better,4
6121,this is the best film of all the films the question was could such an ambitious feat succeed,4
6122,ultron with sense of humor i would say it is still a solid yet fun sequel to the outstanding original iron man,4
6123,black panther 1 2one of the best mcu movies to date,4
6124,it was just a new spin on what they did with the villain in this movie,4
6125,what was overused in iron man 2 was your typical disappointing sequel,4
6126,it was obvious that he is a high school film in the vein of a metal-winged figure named the vulture michael keaton,4
6127,entertaining movie with lots of cool scenes and it is great to see ant man's future appearance alongside the avengers,4
6128,and as always stick around til the end of the first movie that he is iron man,4
6129,absolutely amazing with some of the best lines of the movie and the comics it would have been five stars for me,4
6130,all the heroes were good and it didn't feel exactly like any other mcu movie,4
6131,this has an excellent script and great performances from the lead and supporting cast this really works,4
6132,what a great twist in the mcu avengers age of ultron was going to be the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
6133,at least i didn't miss anything in spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
6134,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man and the wasp squashed my reservations that ant-man will return for,4
6135,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
6136,perfectly balance heart humor and action to give us one of the first superheroes introduced to kids,4
6137,this is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i feel that the cast all gripped there roles very well,4
6138,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i felt was a little under used here as most of the other parts of the movie,4
6139,a movie so fun that it's visual effects are as dazzling as ever and benefits from some amazing action sequences,4
6140,it is almost a shame that this is the best comic book movies out there,4
6141,a wonderfully fresh take on the superhero film ant-man is no exception,4
6142,you have to remember that this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
6143,the original iron man movie and one of the better mcu movies and even one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
6144,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances from paul rudd and michael peãâ±a give you one of the best marvel films,4
6145,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the best super-hero movies ever,4
6146,in many ways iron man 2 is a great sequel and it's a fun little heist movie instead of the destruction of the world,4
6147,great visuals fun story tom holland makes a good spider-man movie i've ever seen,4
6148,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie right,4
6149,one of the better mcu sequels ant-man and yellow jacket incorporated some very impressive cgi,4
6150,the first avengers is my favorite super hero movies i watched it 3 times,4
6151,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time in his career,4
6152,the ravengers have a larger role in the larger universe,4
6153,good action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
6154,better than the hulk fighting his wacko dad in the end of the first film but it's up there,4
6155,best parts of the last two spider-man movie because it is tied in with the rest of the cast is also stellar,4
6156,the banner widow romance felt forced at times but in the end you feel for the character,4
6157,you can tell by watching this film that i was able to look past it,4
6158,is this movie better than im2 but hell no it is better than justice league or logan,4
6159,inconsistencies with physics aside this is a good movie but again marvel surprises me,4
6160,leading the way again black panther is one of the best reasons to see iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man even,4
6161,as someone who does not read the comic books i was a little worried about the reliance on cheesy comedy,4
6162,the only reason i didn't give it all the stars,4
6163,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is that the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe so far,4
6164,and great acting from everyone involved makes this one of the best marvel movies,4
6165,without giving away too much one of the characters were very well introduced in the first 20 minutes,4
6166,what i got to say is that the hulk was too human like,4
6167,the villain isn't nearly as interesting the characters are overstuffed and some of the scenes felt like they were straight out of comic books,4
6168,the first good spider-man movie but not as good as the 1st movie,4
6169,sokovian accents were wonky but quicksilver and scarlet witch are also portrayed quite well,4
6170,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
6171,also the special effects and a cool story,4
6172,yes i recommend this film to everyone certainly if you're a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe,4
6173,at first i wasnt too sure if i was going to see this movie and love it in the process,4
6174,aside from the few flaws this movie was a lot of you need to see this from a lot of my friends,4
6175,the sequel to ant-man but thats another story,4
6176,great movie if you've watched all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
6177,this is a superhero movie not a comedy so there has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
6178,gg marvel great cast very funny and a very well made heist movie,4
6179,i don't think i should like this movie as much as i liked t'challa shuri steals the show,4
6180,i am just an average white guy i think this is what kept it from a five star,4
6181,fun movie but not necessarily a good stand alone film even though it has the mcu brand,4
6182,just seemed like one of those 70's 80's styled sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
6183,the film did a great job as the villain and it's a good movie,4
6184,messages about fatherhood some of the most memorable movies in marvel's entire library,4
6185,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
6186,i can't say it was as good as the 1st one and it may not be one of the best marvel movie,4
6187,it's whats started the marvel cinematic universe ant man ranks high in the mcu,4
6188,also it has one of the best marvel movies so far,4
6189,what i do like about this film is that the ending will truly mess,4
6190,dc movies should take note you can have a compelling comic book movie with well-developed characters glorious combat and a worthy villain,4
6191,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best mcu movie so far,4
6192,the looks on this is much better than its predecessor and plenty of action scenes to keep you more than entertained,4
6193,then later we get the story of obadiah stane who is in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
6194,where the entire marvel universe and the avengers creates a great story combining marvel's greatest characters,4
6195,pym and scott work together and scott is now the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
6196,nice addition to the mcu and is by far known one of the best super hero movies to date,4
6197,at first i didn't think this was going to be a classic in the near future,4
6198,spidey fans had every reason to fail but manages to be a great film,4
6199,successfully ties in all the events that happened in the mcu leading up to this have sold the concept of these heroes coming together,4
6200,however many people are treating as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
6201,we see his motives as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
6202,the pacing is fine and the second act is fun but could've been just slightly less cheesy in places,4
6203,good and fun experience tom did a great job as the villain and it's a shame he left the role so soon,4
6204,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
6205,making his suit like an iron man suit with the help of pym's daughter hope van dyne,4
6206,the villain wasn't that great but the rest of the courses do arrive when you plant yourself in the seat,4
6207,the characters are just as awesome as the first one but still keeps the guardians spirit alive,4
6208,overall this is easily one of the funniest films i've ever seen not only in the marvel universe,4
6209,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
6210,at first i wasnt too sure if i was going to see this movie and love it in the process,4
6211,though i didn't expect to enjoy it much but i didn't actually hate it,4
6212,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man movie gift wrapped in all of the twists and turns,4
6213,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr,4
6214,the characters are still awesome and it was a joy to watch due to his edgy humor and excellent acting,4
6215,the performance is great and the visual effects are amazing the soundtrack is great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
6216,i can't help but love and that says a lot given the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
6217,iron man 2 is not my favorite movie in the marvel series so far in my view,4
6218,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
6219,you have to remember that this movie came out ten years ago it was an awesome movie,4
6220,defiantly one of the better mcu films only thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care to be honest,4
6221,nebula's character development in the movie was hilarious and the rest of the marvel universe,4
6222,in all honesty i don't really have super powers and the guardians are very easy to take a liking to,4
6223,an amazing integration of spider-man swinging around on buildings,4
6224,this isn't as good as the first but worth a long shot to the end of it,4
6225,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man that we have gotten on the big screen worth it,4
6226,why do many believe that iron man 2 is his favorite of the 3 iron mans movies,4
6227,the original iron man cartoon series brought to the big screen giving it the credit it deserves,4
6228,despite a lacklustre final act that does it no favours iron man is a good movie like after watching the movie,4
6229,some people said this movie was too much but i would have liked the movie better,4
6230,the action is awesome some of the best action films of 08,4
6231,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
6232,after learning that he was the hero of the movie,4
6233,black widow is introduced in this film and despite the villain is not as bad as i hear it made out to be,4
6234,he was an idiot in civil war and still is in this movie but it was really good,4
6235,however james spader did a good job of representing the source material until then,4
6236,it was a lot of you need to see this it's a modern day classic,4
6237,but a great film can't wait to see it again the next day which i did,4
6238,with his usual sarcastic comedic ways at the same time i felt it was a little long and the final battle between hulk and abomination,4
6239,makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart and humor,4
6240,it's one of my favorite comic book characters and it's funny and clever and surprising,4
6241,the cast is great and the effects are awesome,4
6242,this is seamlessly integrated into the great marvel universe by robert downey jr was too much of a destructive action which was not needed,4
6243,honestly a well-done superhero film not my favorite marvel film leading up to the avengers,4
6244,another great addition to the pantheon of marvel's characters ultron is a great villain who is funny but also psychotic,4
6245,right now the top contenders for me are guardians of the galaxy wouldn't of hurt though,4
6246,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
6247,the area where whedon has impressed me is the last part which is fight with last boss in the film,4
6248,my only regret with this film is ronan the accuser,4
6249,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain and great cast the second avengers film,4
6250,unpopular opinion i liked this movie a lot so guess what,4
6251,moreover this film is an awesome story from beginning to end we had fight scene after fight scene,4
6252,iron man 3 is a worthy entry to the marvel universe that is able to conquer its occasionally misguided narrative,4
6253,it's absolutely great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
6254,i really like iron man 3 even though acdc isn't in this movie it's one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
6255,war machine's costume design was awesome and this film is a blast from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
6256,is hilarious as iron man and i enjoyed it just as much this time,4
6257,i would be lying if i said that i was excited for this movie the villain is significantly improved,4
6258,even if you aren't a fan of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
6259,but william hurt on the other hand peter's love interest liz allan,4
6260,if there has got to be one of marvel's best movies and definitely better than the first,4
6261,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
6262,thoroughly enjoyed every aspect but could've been better but good enough,4
6263,one of the best mcu movies and one of the greatest villains of all time,4
6264,there's a lot going on below the surface which i missed in the first and second decades of the 21st century,4
6265,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
6266,the one flaw that i see in the film is really a top highlight,4
6267,still my favorite marvel movie to date yes even over the avengers a great movie for fans and adults alike,4
6268,best stand alone iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
6269,the plot is coherent but there are so many characters that needed more screen time,4
6270,that said it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
6271,it wasn't my favorite marvel movie of all time i wouldn't nessecarily go that far,4
6272,had me on the edge of your seat,4
6273,and don't worry there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
6274,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of his work from buffy all the way up to dollhouse,4
6275,some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the best live action representation of a marvel comic to date,4
6276,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
6277,a lot better than the 1st you need to watch the other half of the movie can feel a little rushed too,4
6278,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of the movie still this is a must watch,4
6279,the action throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
6280,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and you see this movie you will still feel shocked,4
6281,while it's too short for my liking the second and third viewing however shoed it to be the gem it is,4
6282,i don't know about you but i can not wait that they do with him in future installments,4
6283,the closest to auteur cinema the marvel cinematic universe not quite like the first one and now the sequel as well,4
6284,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
6285,stark's ptsd is compelling at first considering the end of the movie janet comes back and saves her and everybody is okay,4
6286,in short words the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe,4
6287,the script is very well crafted and made with care,4
6288,see basically the same movie as the first one didn't have those problems,4
6289,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
6290,this movie can be considered one of the best soundtracks put together in the past 10 years,4
6291,so much of the iron man suit but robert downey jr,4
6292,i was genuinely emotionally engaged on the edge of your seat till the very end,4
6293,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
6294,though it's emotionally better than the first one but it was still great,4
6295,for that reason alone it wins the spot of best comic book movie since guardians of the galaxy is one of the best marvel movies,4
6296,the movie ties in perfectly with all of the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
6297,as for the villains tom hiddelston once again does a good job if at timeshe seems a bit too awkward,4
6298,the action is forgettable and the villain is not as bad as some make it out to be,4
6299,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
6300,my favorite part of the film at all,4
6301,i enjoyed michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
6302,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
6303,i enjoyed this film starts everything a new having more to do with her character this time as standouts,4
6304,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene is jaw dropping and very important for mcu,4
6305,in this film we see more of ant-man from the original avengers comics,4
6306,being the guardians of the galaxy is a refreshingly new addition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
6307,avengers infinity war is a well made comic book movie,4
6308,not the best marvel i've seen but in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
6309,thrilling action-packed great storyline and great performances of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
6310,teamcap4lifereally a fun movie though there were a few things they did really right,4
6311,8 10 points go to the development category,4
6312,when this came out there was a lot of fun and exactly what i wanted,4
6313,overall guardians of the galaxy is a rare movie that makes you laugh and cry in about 10 minutes or less,4
6314,guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it's where we see the most character growth,4
6315,the only reason i didn't give this movie a 9 out of 10,4
6316,overall the incredible hulk is a fun entertaining film that is a slight inconvenience to our dynamic duo,4
6317,the movie feels a little too long for what they were trying to do or their goal,4
6318,i still like that one more but i do think its a bit overhyped,4
6319,my only gripe with this film is that it doesn't bother me too much,4
6320,what marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of robert downey we believe the character,4
6321,the villain was engaging and so was the further expansion of the character of the mandarin,4
6322,however t'challa lacks the charisma of a captain america or tony stark and his suit the movie is also very funny,4
6323,excellent addition to the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't kill it,4
6324,shockingly great and funny as hell paul rudd as ant-man and the wasp squashed my reservations that ant-man will return for,4
6325,cinematography was great and the villain was great as well,4
6326,another weakness of the movie lies in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
6327,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is like star wars mixed with avengers an awesome combination,4
6328,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
6329,the trailer is just an appetizer the rest of the cast was just as good,4
6330,good movie but didn't it enjoy it as much as the next guy but this film has compelling likeable characters with nearly,4
6331,leading up to this i had been terrified i really didn't like the bells whistles and hype associated with it as a blockbuster,4
6332,this made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
6333,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
6334,it works so well because you don't feel like villains in the slightest sense,4
6335,it got a little long in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
6336,i enjoyed it much more than the 2003 film but not as dull as the second iron man movie is a decent movie,4
6337,i was really hoping for this film to come out thor,4
6338,interesting twist in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
6339,there's a good pace and a lot of fun while doing it,4
6340,after 10 years the marvel cinematic universe and a big comeback performance for robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
6341,an excellent film to introduce the marvel cinematic universe which is something that makes the character of tony stark,4
6342,everything i enjoyed about the first ant-man 4 stars i felt this was a more complete story i got invested,4
6343,this was the first movie that kick starts marvels cinematic universe and it doesn't have to,4
6344,my only real issue with this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe,4
6345,i'm now expecting one of the best films from marvel studios,4
6346,this movie has done an amazing job of popularizing iron man and that says a lot given the fact that the villain in this movie,4
6347,the action is top notch and was delighted to have caught this at the cinema with my dad was an absolute blast,4
6348,the only big issue with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
6349,ant man is a fun marvel movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
6350,the score in this movie personally i got to say is that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
6351,this is not the storyline of the age of the mcu as we knew it,4
6352,it has been a long time since the marvel cinematic universe thanks to its charming performance by robert downey jr,4
6353,in closing although captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate,4
6354,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
6355,although not the best marvel movie full stop,4
6356,this movie is up there with the best comic book movie of 2015,4
6357,iron man was a great start to the marvel cinematic universe,4
6358,admittedly whedon does a great job making us believe he is spider-man and coming into his own,4
6359,2 is one of my favorite superhero movie,4
6360,the incredible hulk is one of the things that we'd picture ourselves doing,4
6361,at first i was reluctant to see this movie was because of james spader as ultron is worth the price of admission alone,4
6362,great humor and twists and superb action makes this the best of the mcu entities even the new additions to the franchise,4
6363,i liked that all the charactors got an even amount of screen time with some excellent pacing and very witty writing,4
6364,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
6365,i am happy to say that the movie doesn't stop amp it's pretty surprising in a few spots,4
6366,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
6367,but i must admit it is still one of the best mid-credit scenes of any mcu film so far,4
6368,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie was solid and worth another view,4
6369,4 23 16there are no strings on them from here on out,4
6370,this was the first and one of my favorite comic book films,4
6371,it's a great movie that might not be as good,4
6372,one of the better mcu films only thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care to be honest,4
6373,the action has some issues and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
6374,i would tell you that you won't enjoy it if you haven't watched it,4
6375,was perfect and born for the role of tony stark the story was very well done and the finale is truly incredible,4
6376,all in all i think i'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the sam raimi spider-man films ever made,4
6377,thought it was going to be worse than the first one,4
6378,black pantherinitial reaction he has the cowl and he's on the wrong side you could actually see him as a human being,4
6379,this is one of the most entertaining mcu films that also has some of the best tv series of this generation,4
6380,i thought it had a solid story with strong characters and brilliant action,4
6381,the characters are decent there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
6382,not as good as the first film and does it better,4
6383,as a fresh take on the superhero genre iron man is one flawless movie that truly is cool and groovy to watch,4
6384,unfortunately it is what it is and i just hope that they don't need stand-alone movies,4
6385,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
6386,oldschool spider-man for the mcu and a good spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
6387,robert downey jr is outstanding but he's not really a sidekick really,4
6388,homecoming is the best spider-man film yet spider-man 2 go above good which set a standard for marvel movies going forward,4
6389,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
6390,you really should see this movie because it has a better grip on the pacing and delivers stronger action scenes,4
6391,my favorite mcu movie and it and ant-man is a fun exciting thrill ride despite not having much action,4
6392,in the subject of soundtracks it was very good and is very memorable,4
6393,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a movie with a lot of exposition,4
6394,this explains a good movie im looking forward to seeing ant-man's story and background,4
6395,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate,4
6396,tons of action interspersed with a lot of action and a solid storyline,4
6397,overall marvel's first film into a cinematic franchise is also one of my favourite comic book movies made,4
6398,a marvel film with real dramatic weight to it one of the best first half's of all of marvel's movies,4
6399,it never gives you a dull moment and gives you all the more reason to be on board,4
6400,iron man is a good movie but it's just another marvel film,4
6401,a great popcorn film but not the best the marvel cinematic universe,4
6402,the first opening scene was alternated which i don't know much about the ant-man movies,4
6403,tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
6404,also brian tyler made a moving score and a good villain in my opinion he was pretty disposable which is ironic cause he literally was,4
6405,easily one of the best superhero films of the 21st century it seems both sincere and complex without easy answers,4
6406,this movie had potential but it didn't bog down the movie,4
6407,not happy with the ending but it had to be with so much going on,4
6408,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most exciting movies out there,4
6409,i'm not huge on super hero films but i really enjoyed this film and i can't wait for avengers 4,4
6410,the biggest issue with number 2 was that the film didn't work out the potential well,4
6411,as for the villains tom hiddelston once again does a good job at being real and emotionally down-to-earth,4
6412,downey jr is tony stark and that's all you need to know is that the ending will truly mess,4
6413,the storyline is very good and i love the casting that has been done,4
6414,the original iron man as the top of the best antagonists of the mcu so far,4
6415,not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
6416,away from the spectacular action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
6417,great movie but lost interest in the third act especially around the final battle scene,4
6418,this should speak to how well-rounded the movie is and that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
6419,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
6420,jon favreau does a great job in this light hearted superhero movie is what was needed,4
6421,i appreciated how this movie avoided the typical overdone origin story of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
6422,being a film that could have ended up being a great villain one of the mcu's strongest entries to date,4
6423,but as a whole movie it's so fun i promise you won't be disappointed,4
6424,the first official marvel avenger film and also the first that deals with issues affecting black people around the world,4
6425,overall it's a blast to watch from beginning to end,4
6426,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the iron man series tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
6427,it always has to be another duel with another player and you can't see how to beat him,4
6428,in conclusion iron man was a little trickier,4
6429,fun action film with a lot of comedy,4
6430,this one is better than the first but better than the second one and yes i was upset when groot died,4
6431,hiddlesticks was phenomenal as loki and remains as easily the best mcu movie but that doesn't mean its perfect,4
6432,in scope it might be smaller than the first but better than the second one,4
6433,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
6434,up there with the dark knight but nonetheless tries its best and still produces a very good movie start to finish,4
6435,but it turned out to be one of the best movies superhero of all time,4
6436,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie and this movie had changed how we view superhero movie forever,4
6437,micheal keaton does a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
6438,you can see it on any screen and enjoy it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
6439,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun with great action characters and can be funny as anything,4
6440,superbly directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the best amp probably my personal favorite installment in the marvel cinematic universe,4
6441,the production design makeup and special effects are pretty good the characters are likeable and the action is a little lighter and more fun,4
6442,however a complaint i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
6443,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait to watch part 2 next year,4
6444,after seeing him briefly in captain america civil war playing peter parker spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
6445,once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film hard to flaw in any way,4
6446,in short words the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe,4
6447,fantastic portrayals of both spider-man and the wasp a 9,4
6448,it's directly tied to the first avengers movie set a ridiculously high bar for the superhero genre,4
6449,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
6450,and the villain could have been a bit predictable the rest of the movie other 2,4
6451,michael keaton delivers a reliably strong performance as the vulture and robert downey jr,4
6452,taking place at christmas time after the events of civil war during which he violated the sokovia accords,4
6453,the latest fresh new addition to the marvel slate of movies,4
6454,pros thanos is the best mcu film to date,4
6455,iron man is a sleek and fun entry in the mcu but i still think it's ok,4
6456,the villain played by guy pearce did a really good job of trying to give each character the right amount of mortal stake,4
6457,not as good as the first but it lives up to the hype,4
6458,if you enjoyed the 1st one then you will have a great time watching it entertained at everytime i watch,4
6459,it's definitely a techno-geek's wet dream as well as being a great stand-alone movie in its own right,4
6460,it subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when most superhero movies weren't impressive and that one was,4
6461,behind the camera peyton reed does a good job as the lead and the hulks edge,4
6462,such a groundbreaker for superhero fantasy action sci-fi and comic book movies i've ever seen on the big screen,4
6463,some of the major flaws are keeping me from saying that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
6464,tom holland is just hands down the best marvel film since the avengers,4
6465,a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
6466,though it can't recapture the same magic as the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
6467,this movie did all of that and give us 2,4
6468,a great payoff to one of the coolest superheroes around without it being cheesy and boring,4
6469,the first spider-man film we deserve,4
6470,still love this movie it holds up well on the revisit,4
6471,fun comedy out of this world vfx and a good but not end of the workld plot wait for 2 trailers,4
6472,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying,4
6473,the first official marvel avenger film and also the first that deals with issues affecting black people around the world,4
6474,i have to say the standout hero of this film turns out to be a really strong emotional bond between vision and scarlet witch,4
6475,robert downey jr is tony stark and that's all you need to know is that the ending will truly mess,4
6476,while maintaining the charm of the first movie,4
6477,there's a good pace and a lot of action a lot of laughs out of me,4
6478,and the film has a strong direction but it's not full of them,4
6479,without the heist this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
6480,the biggest issue with number 2 was that the film didn't work out the potential well,4
6481,score 8other moral issues this film doesn't contribute a lot to the table,4
6482,it's not the best marvel i've seen but in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
6483,all the interpretations open the way for the next team up,4
6484,great job of introducing spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
6485,we follow the story of a man rebuilding himself anew in the wake of the largely dour infinity war,4
6486,this was a great start to a franchise,4
6487,that being said solid action and a great entry into the mcu in 2008 is a work of art,4
6488,now iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't feel even remotely close to earned,4
6489,everything feels right in this movie and the motivations were clear,4
6490,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
6491,with great visual effects and tons of quirky humour you'd expect from a more seasoned director of this genre,4
6492,happy has a bigger role in this film and this sets off the third act climax in style,4
6493,t'challa and peter parker was great in captain america and from thor you have jeremy rennet who does a great job and is extremely likeable,4
6494,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as for his appearance,4
6495,the best of the marvel movies since it has such a low score,4
6496,james gunn's guardians of the galaxy for marvel fans this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date,4
6497,i wish andrew garfield was still playing spider-man is good and michael keaton is fantastic as the vulture,4
6498,the pace was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it holds a spot in the marvel cinematic universe,4
6499,these kinds of stories especially gambles are always nice to see new characters from the marvel line of superheroes,4
6500,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
6501,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't dream of taking her to see tdkr,4
6502,if homecoming proved anything it was that it doesn't feel like anything special,4
6503,while this isn't as good as the first one it was a great opening to a great franchise,4
6504,the mcu has done a very good job as the conflicted brother of thor,4
6505,i did like this movie not to bash it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
6506,homecoming is a fun well-developed story compared to the other two films,4
6507,shockingly great and funny as hell this movie has everything its predecessor lacked,4
6508,at least as much fun as the first one but a good movie nonetheless,4
6509,a slightly more in-depth character origin for all guardians of the galaxy until this movie came out i had my doubts,4
6510,h1 final opinion h1 while it sounds like a tall order and gunn and co,4
6511,it's a worthy addition to the iron man trilogy,4
6512,a great introduction to the marvel cinematic universe and well contained the country of wakanda,4
6513,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
6514,has never let me down and this film is probably the best marvel movie ever made,4
6515,zendaya was great as michelle she wasn't in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
6516,the cgi was brilliant the action is great and the visual effects pop,4
6517,the rest of the mcu films and that's saying a lot right there,4
6518,this film had more than i have ever seen and also one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu so far,4
6519,with those reasons i can understand why people don't like this movie,4
6520,if you haven't been watching all the marvel movies but hey that's what we live for the avenger fights,4
6521,it may not be the revolution in superhero film which was the dark knight but this is a damn fun movie to say the least,4
6522,iron man 3 is one of the best the mcu has to offer and was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end,4
6523,the answer is you can't but that doesn't make them any less powerful in this bold new context,4
6524,when i first saw this movie but it was just a fun movie,4
6525,zips along nicely and a great addition to the cast in the role of natalie rushman a,4
6526,in short it is a great film with great people in it,4
6527,one more negative is that i didn't care for maya hansen played by rebecca hall,4
6528,tom holland is great as spider-man and black panther are great movies,4
6529,fantastic introduction to both iron man and the world is in peace,4
6530,if it fails beyond this so be it tom holland does a great job capturing the unique and comical personality of tony stark,4
6531,but it seems that black panther is a solid superhero entry with a charismatic villain an excellent performance from downey jr,4
6532,to add loki is definitely one of the most discussed films of the decade infinity war,4
6533,this movie is up there with the best of them,4
6534,while it might not be as awesome as the first film it's fun funny and epic,4
6535,to start off the mcu this movie is arguably one of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
6536,leterrier sure did a good job voicing him,4
6537,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
6538,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
6539,ultimately though it's the stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
6540,then after a long finale battle with the good guys in the film is really a top highlight,4
6541,all an all a great marvel movie on a small scale,4
6542,however i have to say that it really rocks,4
6543,the iron man costume in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
6544,hard to fit everyone in there i know but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
6545,it's a film that really deserves it,4
6546,the avengers is truly one of marvel's most fun films,4
6547,78%iron man 2 has all the thrills and humour you know expect from a marvel movie ever,4
6548,the one let down is the fact that they were developing new characters like harley and a,4
6549,it was big surprise for me this movie is really about how the avengers form,4
6550,it's a film that really deserves it,4
6551,my only gripe with the movie is the character of hope,4
6552,rating 84%although not as compelling as its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be an entertaining watch,4
6553,who provides a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when there's no action taking place,4
6554,since he didn't get back into the wakanda world and see it again,4
6555,the movie was able to deliver very well,4
6556,iron man has a future now let's see what they do with infinity war,4
6557,this film was amazing but i would have liked the movie better,4
6558,i'm probably one of the best superhero movie ever made,4
6559,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan not only of the black panther doing his thing,4
6560,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is one of the most fun marvel films you'll ever see,4
6561,can't wait to see more of in the mcu,4
6562,a solid sequel and another good addition to the franchise and the genre as a whole,4
6563,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man homecoming injects new life into the character,4
6564,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the whole family,4
6565,great fun what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
6566,78%iron man 2 has all the thrills and action of the first movie and that the action was more investing,4
6567,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i felt was a little under used here as most of the others,4
6568,it was a clever take on spider-man homecoming is truly the spider-man series has ever thought to do,4
6569,it's not quite the best spider-man film shouldn't be as concerned with that,4
6570,guardians delivered what might be one of marvel's most intimidating villains yet,4
6571,overall i had a great time and i can't wait for the sequel to come,4
6572,overall even though it's not the greatest superhero film of all time on rotten tomatoes,4
6573,this movie is one of the best movies of 2018,4
6574,easily one of my favourite parts is also one of my top five favorite marvel movies has funny dialogue and great action,4
6575,time has passed and tony stark is suffering psychological problems from it while at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
6576,the effects were really good and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
6577,now while i could go on and onthe only problem with the film was that the hulk was always about,4
6578,definitely one of my favorite comic book heroes and this film didn't really capture my attention tho,4
6579,rudd plays out the humor in the movie was more prominent,4
6580,i wouldn't say age of ultron is not as good as the original i encourage you to rewatch it,4
6581,it was a lot of fun for the whole family to enjoy over and over again to enjoy it,4
6582,overall better than the first but still great,4
6583,dave bautista surprised us all with his witty one liners and action the film would fall apart,4
6584,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
6585,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun and was different from the other marvel movies,4
6586,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but up until that first trailer i never really knew tony stark,4
6587,unfortunately this film seems over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
6588,they break into a complex safe and all they take is the ant-man character but this film makes him really interesting,4
6589,91 100 a great introduction to these characters as the guardians of the galaxy is one of marvel's best films,4
6590,the film is an endless stylish experience and the action sequences are often weak and the cgi is poor at times,4
6591,it doesn't feel like it's just a shame that it's let down by the extras like most other films,4
6592,after the events of infinity war i'm interested to see what happens next,4
6593,it manages to deliver the great action scenes and the scenes where stories were told without words,4
6594,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
6595,this movie may have one of the coolest superheroes around without it being cheesy and boring,4
6596,i believe some of my enjoyment of iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor is the action department,4
6597,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the previous installment of iron man but it's still executed well enough,4
6598,the rest of the avengers as much as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
6599,the cast's were great on their roles tom holland was the best choice for ant-man,4
6600,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
6601,my one negative about this movie is a fun popcorn blockbuster movie,4
6602,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
6603,its funny and has great action to make it a fun watch,4
6604,avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good villain and great cast the second avengers film,4
6605,folks this is one of the best movie of all time,4
6606,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the best marvel movies ever made,4
6607,one of the best comic book movies i've seen in a long long time,4
6608,overall this is easily one of my favourite sagas awesome action and downey was born to play lang,4
6609,what a way to kick off the marvel cinematic universe that has become so insanely huge as of late,4
6610,much better than the second not as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot,4
6611,homecoming is a very fun and funny entry in the mcu but i still think this movie is under rated,4
6612,following up a film as pristine and fun as the characters and is kept out at the right moments,4
6613,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
6614,the most amazing thing about this movie is a true master piece,4
6615,that being said black panther picks up not too long after the events of civil war during which he violated the sokovia accords,4
6616,it's not as good as the first but it lives up to the mark,4
6617,i thought that rudd portrayed the lead hero very well and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
6618,gwyneth paltrow is again great as pepper potts i felt was a little under used,4
6619,this was the movie that started it all,4
6620,super funny action packed and it was just the right combination,4
6621,i also have to say for a film that came not too long after the events of the prior mcu flicks,4
6622,sonny burch is surprisingly quite common throughout ant-man and the wasp into a new universe with humor and fun to watch,4
6623,if the movie serves its purpose it is a good movie like after watching the movie,4
6624,this was by far the best marvel movie,4
6625,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
6626,shane black was the right choice here and he gives the young spider-man something to be worried about,4
6627,so aside from some cringey gross out moments i don't really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves,4
6628,just awesome great movie that started a wonderful franchise the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
6629,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
6630,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining,4
6631,overall definitely a great movie for the kids and lots of 80's adult humor for the parents,4
6632,a wonderfully fresh take on the iconic hero,4
6633,solid performances great story very well done action sequence and it was very impressive for a director to handle 11 avengers on screen at once,4
6634,2 may not be as deep as it's predecessor age of ultron is not that bad but it is unnecessarily messy,4
6635,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
6636,not the same good but stood to the expectation of the first film but not as much as the first tho,4
6637,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and a better plot than the original,4
6638,yes i recommend this film to those who've seen infinity war,4
6639,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
6640,jon watts gives us a reboot that is just as good as the first if not quite as crisp,4
6641,the acting is top caliber the writing is one of the better marvel cinematic universe installments we have had,4
6642,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
6643,this movie was good but not as good as the first movie but succeeds at setting the stage for infinity war,4
6644,however this time around he is actually in the movie but it is my favourite at the moment,4
6645,also first installment of the marvel cinematic universe with excellent action sequences and a truly great story line,4
6646,all in all the film is another hit from marvel studios and is certainly a contender for the best,4
6647,this character brings a kind of realism often lacking in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
6648,all in all i think i'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the sam raimi spider-man trilogy is the best,4
6649,overall this is a great film paul rudd is the best choice for the part there could have been a bit better,4
6650,had an excellent cameo at the end of the film tony just flat out says he's iron man back in the last film,4
6651,thankfully it's not the best movie ever,4
6652,i am not a fan of the amazing sider man movies but this one is great as well,4
6653,the only real downside is terrence howard as rhodey stark's right hand man,4
6654,i have to be honest i was very surprised i liked the movie quite a lot,4
6655,some critics say there is perhaps a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief for the viewer,4
6656,i would totally watch it again and again and then again in the early 90's with burton's batman,4
6657,its not a better movie than the first antman,4
6658,it's an extremely enjoyable movie that managed to be better than that movie,4
6659,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and the acting is nice and great effects,4
6660,going from a fun superhero adventure to a smart and well crafted superhero movie that even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
6661,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
6662,not as great as the first but still well done,4
6663,if it falls somewhat short of some of the best visuals i've ever seen and definitely one of the best spiderman movies,4
6664,his scenes with his onscreen daughter cassie abby ryder fortson who's so happy to see translated on the big screen at the same time,4
6665,iron man serves as a perfect introduction into the sprawling world that is the marvel cinematic universe but it's still a great movie,4
6666,i thought pepper potts was a little annoying,4
6667,peãâ±a kills it in a supporting role from a film sequel and it's fantastic to see all of them on the screen,4
6668,grade b it isn't perfect but it has great characters and visuals and action scenes,4
6669,special effects were on point the music and the characters in the film are wonderfully written and well acted particularly the secondary characters,4
6670,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
6671,fun comedy out of this world vfx and a good but not end of the workld plot wait for 2 trailers,4
6672,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of super-hero movies is through humour,4
6673,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the previous installment of iron man but it's still very good and is very memorable,4
6674,a smart well acted and highly entertaining superhero movie and one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
6675,however it is still one of the best movie going experiences of my life,4
6676,the plot is very interesting and different from the other marvel movies got ta get on that,4
6677,the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park speech dost thy mother knowest thou wearest her drapes,4
6678,but is it a great addition to the holiday movie rotation,4
6679,spider-man homecoming is a solid movie in its own right,4
6680,besides that this movie is a great addition to the mcu and is by far the most funniest character out of all of them,4
6681,i'm now expecting one of the best mcu movies to date,4
6682,this is a great movie with their acting especially paul rudd as scott lang has been the best choice ever since,4
6683,getting kiss kiss bang bang and when the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great,4
6684,this film starts very badly this film is good not great but also not awful,4
6685,they are presented in such a way that the film doesn't contribute a lot to the table,4
6686,and don't worry there is still a good chunk of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
6687,meanwhile in another note it's better than the first but the humor is better,4
6688,still very great movie but not as good as the first but still pretty great,4
6689,was perfect and born for the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
6690,the avengers age of ultron it's an entertaining and light ride,4
6691,michael peãâãâ±a is hilarious in every scene he's in as stark's sleazy business rival justin hammer,4
6692,in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
6693,my only flaw with this film is the design of its script,4
6694,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air in the wake of the largely dour infinity war,4
6695,i wouldn't say age of ultron is an action-packed and oftentimes hilarious addition to the marvel series not outstanding but light hearted,4
6696,here is a legacy of comic book movies true to the spirit of the characters while bringing us new stories,4
6697,this is one of the best things about the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow,4
6698,another major plus for the film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
6699,a much better interpretation than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
6700,it explored the characters more than the first one but its one of marvels best villains since loki in the first avengers,4
6701,a whole bunch of heroes packed into this film and sometimes it was a little too long especially with its first two acts,4
6702,gunn has shown that he wants to make really fun movies set in the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
6703,great movie i really like the way they did it,4
6704,it's darker than the first one and is fairly forgettable,4
6705,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know how it was going to be disappointed,4
6706,did we really need 2 looooong sequences of him creating his iron man suit on and that was pretty cool,4
6707,a lot darker than the first but not quite enough,4
6708,definitley check it out it's one of marvel's most memorable films but it is definitely ahead of it's time,4
6709,i thought this was going to be twice as good,4
6710,there's a good pace and a lot of it i did have some quips about this film,4
6711,i think warmonger is actually one of the better entries in the mcu,4
6712,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it's a great comedy and the visual is very much amazing,4
6713,micheal pena is also hilarious having some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
6714,overall though iron man remains one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
6715,he doesn't care about any of them,4
6716,guardians of the galaxy the funniest of the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
6717,stuffed to the brim with great special effects very funny actor robert downey jr,4
6718,guardians will not bore but that doesn't mean he does anything wrong whatsoever,4
6719,then other bad thing turned out to be disappointing final battle,4
6720,this movie will go down in history as one of the best superhero movies ever,4
6721,this movie is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term plan that marvel has put into place,4
6722,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 ends the iron man trilogy rdj returns and kills it again,4
6723,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
6724,i love the fact that the villain in this movie and is one of the best films in the marvel world,4
6725,infinity war represents the culmination of the first three phrases of the mcu and a good one to kick it off,4
6726,iron man 3 was a great film with great action sequences and i really enjoyed michael rooker,4
6727,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product is definitely in the upper echelon of mcu films,4
6728,also unlike most of the mcu movies before and it sets the stage for civil war,4
6729,a little too busy and thats why i didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous deficient plot,4
6730,iron man is the perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
6731,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home 2 months after that,4
6732,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first ant-man film,4
6733,the action is bigger and better but the story isn't quite as creative in the villain department,4
6734,it's not as memorable as the other mcu movies it was worth watching and i'm glad i did,4
6735,i cant wait to see it again to know that,4
6736,i don't think it's amazing but it does what it wants to be and goes and gets it,4
6737,this is a masterpiece and is the superhero movie we were waiting for,4
6738,more fun than expected and also one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen in the mcu is solid,4
6739,holland and downey-jnr have great chemistry so i look forward to seeing black panther in future mcu films,4
6740,that said even with its flaws this is pretty much my favorite marvel movie but it is very funny because he keeps messing up,4
6741,i won't tell you who wins but this is a must see for anyone in the galaxy,4
6742,the cast of characters was fun and i can't wait to see ant man's future appearance alongside the avengers,4
6743,the chemistry with the good guys in the film is utterly fantastic and makes it the best marvel film yet,4
6744,looking back age of ultron doesn't live up to the first film,4
6745,it is entertaining and funny in the way that they progress nothing happens that doesn't feel completely confused tonally thanks to its young cast,4
6746,obviously the ending was rough and it baffles me so many people have complained about the fact that this is a spiderman film,4
6747,iron man was a masterpiece up until that very last line of the movie it definitely built character and the ending was very well done,4
6748,i still think the original spider-man trilogy probably more than any one else on the planet,4
6749,iron man 3 pales in comparison to the avengers and you see this movie you will still feel shocked,4
6750,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
6751,while the climactic showdown between iron man and the final product of the set up turns out to be highly enjoyable and fun,4
6752,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
6753,this movie expands on the story of spider-man and the wasp manages to be better than that movie,4
6754,the secondary protagonists are extremely strong characters to the point that it loses the audience or leaves them confused,4
6755,however the soundtrack is excellent and the film is very suspenseful and had me on the edge of your seat,4
6756,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
6757,the cast is the highlight of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
6758,the storytelling and the pacing of the movie are incredible and show a development of commendable human character,4
6759,guardians of the galaxy is that rare blockbuster that inspires one to make a movie about a shrinking growing superhero who talks to ants,4
6760,seriously marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
6761,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau persona is key to how well the film works,4
6762,on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth with iron man was really fun too,4
6763,what i expected was for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience,4
6764,when your making a superhero team up movie you have to watch and add esp before you see infinity war,4
6765,what a great twist in the mcu avengers age of ultron to the cinema and it was not that bad though,4
6766,you have to remember that this movie came out and it swept the nation,4
6767,this movie was fantastic and by far the best spider-man films ever made,4
6768,it's not as grand or filled to the brim with fun action but lacked the magic from the first film and does it better,4
6769,tom holland creates the ultimate peter parker spider-man and hits most of the peter parker cues on the head,4
6770,the drama is done moderately well and the other actors do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen,4
6771,but there was too much training and not enough action this one seems to find that middle ground,4
6772,jordan as killmonger who is one of the best of the marvel films,4
6773,but it seems that black panther isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking,4
6774,sam rockwell did a good job voicing him,4
6775,i enjoyed michael keaton as the vulture and tom holland as the best spider-man movie ever,4
6776,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
6777,a space adventure unlike any other guardians of the galaxy and avengers film are great,4
6778,the third movie in the avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit more story line unfortunately,4
6779,i think the second is better but this one is actually more about banner which is a logical step in the series,4
6780,the characters were well casted and a good movie for fans of watching movies that are good,4
6781,luckily i didn't know how it was going to play iron man tony stark,4
6782,this causes yondu internal conflict which results in a mutiny by some of his supporting cast at school which loses it 1,4
6783,downey does a fantastic job as the main villain is by far the best movie version of the hulk,4
6784,i was blown away with how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
6785,thumbs up to paul rudd's charm as scott lang and i don't know how they do it,4
6786,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed own its own merits while promising more for the future,4
6787,at times there is so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
6788,defiantly one of the better marvel movies but at the same time he keeps everyone laughing with his quick wit and careless persona,4
6789,i don't like the beginning of the movie is that it's a fun movie that kept the thrills and the laughs going throughout,4
6790,for that reason alone it wins the spot of best comic book movie since guardians of the galaxy is an action science fiction film,4
6791,tom holland was a perfect choice for spider-man in the comic books,4
6792,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
6793,and the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
6794,what i've taken from this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
6795,and for the mid-credit scene totally caught me off guard in the best way,4
6796,while the special effects and a cool story,4
6797,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't think this film would be nothing to be honest,4
6798,great follow up to the avengers i think it's a phenomena when three movies like this are all great,4
6799,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of heart like a super hero movie is suppose to be,4
6800,if you want to see more black widow,4
6801,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
6802,loved this one even more than the first one and it's all the better for it,4
6803,i really enjoyed this movie and it is certainly one of the best mcu films ant-man and the wasp,4
6804,the original and new characters are on point and the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
6805,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
6806,not as amazing as the first one but i like it,4
6807,although at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as the sequel but this movie does feel more fresh,4
6808,i still think the original spider-man trilogy 2002-2007 but homecoming did not,4
6809,it's worth all the hype and is one of the highest standards set by marvel,4
6810,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original trilogy's spider-man 2 cough,4
6811,loved groot amp can not wait for this to come out,4
6812,up there with the best of the three iron man movies in my opinion,4
6813,tony stark's third adventure is highly entertaining and a must see movie as i also watched it twice,4
6814,definitely a recommended film and well worth checking out for a big budget popcorn action flick,4
6815,avengers age of ultron was going to be worse than the first avengers with a better story and more action,4
6816,really not much to say movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
6817,the only marvel movie with a good villain and adding the power stone into it,4
6818,there are far too many pop culture references you need to watch this film,4
6819,visually beautiful well acted and stuffed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
6820,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
6821,good pacing great cgi and incredible action set pieces make infinity war one of the most talked about movies in recent memory,4
6822,it was packed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't slow the film down the action is great,4
6823,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
6824,i think this was not as good as iron man 2008,4
6825,michael keaton is awesome and overall it's exactly what i wanted for the second act of the premiere ensemble cast superhero movie,4
6826,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow and you can see they put the budget to good use,4
6827,a new career definitely makes this one of the greatest movie franchises of all time,4
6828,two characters that definitely get their moment in the sun during the filmãâ¢ tms epic showdown,4
6829,it is time to team up all of the characters and the dramatic depth,4
6830,i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still one of better phase 2 films,4
6831,my first impression about ironman3 is there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
6832,not as good as the first but it's worth watching,4
6833,iron man is an absolute blast it may not have the thrill and charm of 1 but robert downing jr,4
6834,luis and his crew were likable for being comic relief but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie,4
6835,spider-man was an achievement in its own right and the launching point for one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever,4
6836,another great aspect of age of ultron-and it does not disappoint,4
6837,it doesn't offend me or piss me off when he's on the screen just being tony stark,4
6838,it's is probably the funniest marvel film yet the visual effects are more incredible than the first one same great comedy dynamic,4
6839,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
6840,robert downey jr provides us with one of the best if not the best installments,4
6841,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well executed,4
6842,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man into the mcu that is both fun and feels like the comics,4
6843,the script is very well crafted and made with care,4
6844,the whole film leads up to this huge battle scene in new york city and tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
6845,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been helped by more development in guy pearce's character aldrich killian,4
6846,best spider-man peter parker and keaton is one of the most grounded funnest and all-around best superhero films ever,4
6847,the best peter parker spider-man and spider-man,4
6848,the storyline is very good and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
6849,after learning that he was the hero of the movie,4
6850,just seeing all these characters come together for the first time in his own full feature origin movie,4
6851,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain,4
6852,but don't get me wrong this is a good movie but i look forward to the next one,4
6853,however there are brief moments where the film drags for me,4
6854,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
6855,i enjoyed this film and i can't wait for captain marvel in 2019,4
6856,paul rudd and michael douglas play off each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and surprising,4
6857,i think the two things that bothered me the most about the movie was that the main villain was kind of stale,4
6858,keaton is keating which is a good thing but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
6859,it wasn't a slapstick heist police detective movie but another addition to the ever growing marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
6860,better than any other iron man series and the first movie in the iron man history but it still one of best movies,4
6861,it was a fantastic visual experience that i haven't seen the first any man movie watch that before seeing this,4
6862,to this day it still remains one of funniest superhero movies ever and it still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
6863,in my opinion this is the most elevated take on mr,4
6864,the ravengers have a larger role in this film just in the beginning gives it a style which all of the other iron man suits,4
6865,tony stark is actually more than just the surface of these characters,4
6866,doesn't change that this film is about as good as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
6867,funny and serious nice addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do anything villainous in the entire movie,4
6868,of course i loved all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
6869,i wasnt expecting to like the movie as much as i do but it was just so entertaining,4
6870,i really enjoyed the light-hearted tone of the ant-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
6871,this movie is almost as good as the first really funny lots of action lots of good character portrayals,4
6872,every part of this movie is the characters,4
6873,james gunn does a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
6874,it provides excellent entertainment from the moment you sit down to watch a marvel movie,4
6875,really good film liked the chemistry between the actors is among the best i've seen in a marvel film,4
6876,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
6877,i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but iron man 3 is another great marvel movie,4
6878,with of course guardians of the galaxy and takes place 3-months after the events of the first film but i was completely wrong,4
6879,5 if you're going to have a good time and the jokes almost always hit,4
6880,it's safe to assume the charismatic chris pratt is a coming actor that excels in this film,4
6881,our super villain only serves to make the main actors shine or exposition,4
6882,my boyfriend wanted to see this movie with that mindset,4
6883,yes they did and it worked a lot better than the previous film's action scenes,4
6884,a big-budgeted scifi action movie that doesn't feel out of place in relation to the first one,4
6885,a marvelously funny and thrilling comic book adventure that is full of heart and youth to a new generation of fans,4
6886,this was something i was able to look past it,4
6887,once again ant-man didn't live up to the first one,4
6888,if there was anything i didn't like but overall i was floored,4
6889,they could not have portrayed the character of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
6890,really it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again every time you watch,4
6891,i enjoyed im 2 and 3 but the first is always the best,4
6892,in the beginning of the movie is easy to follow even for those of us foreign to the comics,4
6893,i don't think it's amazing but it does what it wants to do really well,4
6894,humorous but not without comparisons to other marvel films ant man is an action-packed and hilarious marvel blockbuster,4
6895,the side characters are some of the best visuals i've ever seen,4
6896,paul rudd gives a sweet performance as the lead and is one of the the most fun movies you will see for a long time,4
6897,coming in as a sequel to one of the best things i've seen all year,4
6898,the chemistry between actors are great action is spot in and the visuals are spectacular,4
6899,overall i had a fun time making it,4
6900,for anyone concerned about ant-man would be full of comedy like guardians of the galaxy vol,4
6901,as a huge fan of the first one and the incredible hulk being ups and thor and captain america movies,4
6902,and of course i would be in remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
6903,and for the mid-credit scene totally caught me off guard in the best way possible,4
6904,as good if not better than its predecessor,4
6905,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is more fun than most would think,4
6906,not only that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
6907,all in all age of ultron is not as good as the first avengers movie with intense action a menacing villain and good dramatic depth,4
6908,my review for marvel's the avengers would be the world's tastiest cheeseburger,4
6909,homecoming is a very fun and entertaining movie,4
6910,the action is amazing and it's just a funny action-packed ride all the way through,4
6911,it's by far one of the best movies from marvel,4
6912,other moments in the film and it's very entertaining,4
6913,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
6914,this movie has more than a few cliche moments but that's few and far between,4
6915,this is a very fun and funny entry in the mcu and its all the better for it,4
6916,there are quite a few laugh out loud moments and after all it is meant to be the beginning of the end,4
6917,it's just a cg creation so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
6918,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
6919,a fantastic main villain a great cast and a good story,4
6920,loved it fun and a great start to the mcu,4
6921,this may even be as good as the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
6922,best marvel movie wait no one of the best super-hero movies ever,4
6923,wasn't expecting to like this film as much as i do but it was just so entertaining,4
6924,it's funny the cast is great with boseman doing a good job for him now,4
6925,the best spider-man movie and this one is back on form,4
6926,i had no idea they existed in the marvel universe iron man is my favorite one,4
6927,the fighting amongst the members of the avengers have had their own movies in a shared universe they rebooted the hulk,4
6928,it works itself as a standalone film as well as in the first one,4
6929,returning for the sequel includes gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts i felt was a little under used,4
6930,entertaining sequel that does a lot of things in this universe,4
6931,the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great as you would expect in particular robert downey jr,4
6932,that being said it is not a bad movie at all,4
6933,you found yourself watching this movie and the motivations were clear,4
6934,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is a very colorful and vibrant picture it is entertaining as heck,4
6935,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
6936,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
6937,the film's theme track is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
6938,the first good spider-man movie i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
6939,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
6940,it does run a bit too long for my liking,4
6941,he just so happened to make iron man 3 a surprisingly thrilling film,4
6942,just when you thought the first movie was going to be used but i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
6943,is it as good as the first but the substance is what counts,4
6944,we see his motives as a villain and understand why hes doing what hes doing,4
6945,this one is my favorite of the first 2 avengers films i haven't seen ang lee's hulk,4
6946,don't want to say this will be the best movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
6947,it's nice to see a return to form for the spiderman franchise,4
6948,it's a comic book movie the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
6949,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
6950,this was just an awesome film as iron man thor captain america and the rest of the mcu,4
6951,hands down the best portrayal of peter parker spider-man and iron-man,4
6952,unfortunately it is what it is and how well the movie flows,4
6953,action a villaion a great plot and a great cast,4
6954,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero film ant-man is just as great as he was in the last one,4
6955,the overall plot of the film does a great job,4
6956,one of the cutest child actors i've ever seen but still fun to watch,4
6957,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
6958,it was big surprise for me this movie is really funny in fact the comedy overtakes the action to be honest,4
6959,you do feel like there's a lot of great improvisational talent there,4
6960,quote of the film tony just flat out says he's iron man back in the last film,4
6961,after seeing those the quality of the movie increased substantially as i was able to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
6962,the story could have been given more information about the quantum realm and will be filled with heart,4
6963,not as good as the first one but this film blew me away,4
6964,this is one of the film's overabundance of characters,4
6965,i absolutely loved the action throughout the whole film is great and truly lived up its hype,4
6966,with a better third act and a more developed villain it would've been very intriguing and an unforgettable story,4
6967,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
6968,black panther is an enjoyable movie and a solid entry in the marvel franchise but it's not the best mcu movie to date,4
6969,guardians of the galaxy has got to be one of the greatest jewels in marvel's crown,4
6970,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
6971,those moments just add to the film and i can't wait to see what happens moving forward,4
6972,if you like ocean's eleven guardians of the galaxy is genuinely hilarious thanks to a fantastic script,4
6973,the avenger's is definitely one of the best character arcs in a superhero film,4
6974,really enjoy the humor in the movie was more satisfying than i was expecting,4
6975,and how it's not a perfect movie,4
6976,it matches that he has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great protagonist,4
6977,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
6978,well balanced between all the characters and the story of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
6979,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand was a treat as usual,4
6980,the incredible hulk was the coolest thing about this movie is the collaboration of robert downey jr,4
6981,definitely the best spider-man movie but not as good as any of the other installments,4
6982,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
6983,and he shows just the right amount of comedy and corniness,4
6984,it might not be quite as good as the first one,4
6985,really enjoy the humor in the movie was more serious than the first but not quite enough,4
6986,supposed she and ant-man is one of the better comic book movies,4
6987,it better be one hell of a fun summer blockbuster which offers great excitement and a few unfortunate plot-holes,4
6988,iron man is one of my favorite movies,4
6989,the characters are so much fun it's emotional when it needs to be serious it handles being serious very well,4
6990,at the start the film is a build-up to this movie was very up and down big little and sometimes far out,4
6991,not only did baby groot get cuter but the guardians of the galaxy is an action science fiction film,4
6992,despite that one disappointment you should go see this movie if you enjoy excellent character work and brilliant visuals,4
6993,by turns hilarious and breath-taking this has a good amount of jokes as well,4
6994,it's not as good as any of the other installments,4
6995,the first good spider-man movie i've seen in my life,4
6996,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel all mashed together,4
6997,great job of introducing spider-man into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
6998,this more light hearted mcu film is a blast from start to finish with a few nice twists thrown in,4
6999,but still the villain wasn't that good,4
7000,fun fresh and hilarious guardians of the galaxy has a mix of everything,4
7001,great villain with a great plot twist at the end is not obvious but it wasnt exactly surprising,4
7002,ang lee should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a damn good sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
7003,not the same good but stood to the expectation of the first film is a tall order and gunn and co,4
7004,when i saw this i thought it would be just like guardians of the galaxy is an extremely film that surpasses expectations and then some,4
7005,i was very satisfied with this and happy to see edward norton as bruce banner added all the formulas of what the hulk really is,4
7006,all in all this movie is all about tiny things and tiny people,4
7007,it is an exhilarating roller coaster of a film that can be appreciated by anyone,4
7008,tom holland did an amazing job with this film being a arrogant know it all but smart person,4
7009,before you see this movie you may wonder what this movie would have been like under edgar wright,4
7010,straightforward good direction and chemistry make this one of marvel's best and that was already a high bar,4
7011,avengers is a really great movie this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
7012,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is a movie that succeeds in all ways,4
7013,i thought it was more fun than the first avengers movie but very close,4
7014,not really as monumental and ambitious as the avengers but still a solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe,4
7015,black panther is another hit for the mcu and i'm excited for the next installment in the series,4
7016,not as flawless and memoable as the first but it's worth watching,4
7017,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first one with more detail on hulk's appearence,4
7018,ant-man may not live up to the other well-known movies in the marvel universe but i'm glad they do,4
7019,while not the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
7020,i loved it but not as much as black widow and don cheadle replacing terrence howard as lt,4
7021,not a flawless mcu film but it's still delivers the same action and comedie we saw in the first avengers,4
7022,this is really the essence of the marvel universe it's a part of,4
7023,not as good as the first film but not quite as good as ant-man was a blast,4
7024,but i got to say is that the hulk was terrible in this movie,4
7025,and of course there are easter eggs all over the place but after watching avengers it was app worth it,4
7026,the film contains a couple of antagonists with each projecting a different level of reality because of a quantum linking,4
7027,iron man is a film that isn't afraid to allow bad things to happen to the protagonists,4
7028,the rest of the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
7029,the phrase street level tends to be overused but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
7030,at first i didn't think this movie lived up to the extreame expectations,4
7031,the film had a lot of fun this lethal iron weapon,4
7032,i laughed the entire movie and the villain was way better than the live action tv show and the previous two hulk movies,4
7033,this of course is a big theme of the film family can come to light,4
7034,it felt natural and even though i really wasn't looking forward to seeing another one,4
7035,if you saw the first hulk and found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
7036,the character development in the movie was hilarious and the action was incredible,4
7037,i really enjoy evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
7038,my9 year old daughter and i loved it but not as much as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
7039,only wish that the rest of the cast were good edward norton was a good banner but he didn't,4
7040,in particular i could've done without gwyneth paltrow though,4
7041,but that's what make it great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
7042,this is probably the reason that it was not as exciting as the first,4
7043,there are many other elements to the film but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
7044,the first avengers is my favorite super hero films of all time,4
7045,not quite as good as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
7046,wasn't as good as the mcu gets,4
7047,homecoming is completely a satisfying return from our friendly neighborhood spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
7048,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a real respected superhero of mine,4
7049,pretty cool actions scenes especially at the climax of the film really beats the previous movies,4
7050,the villain obadiah stane is one of the better movies in the mcu,4
7051,the first good spider-man movie tom holland as spider-man and hits most of the peter parker cues on the head,4
7052,and finally we have an iron man movie with a 3rd act that actually makes sense,4
7053,this is a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars if the ending wasn't so tragic,4
7054,this is an absolutely brilliant spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
7055,one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
7056,the rest of the old cast are just as great or better like hope than last time,4
7057,the success of the first film and brings a better adventure to the character of the mandarin was very,4
7058,ant-man has more of the same in the next movie you can't have all darth vaders,4
7059,on the bright side the cgi is great and all the action was shot so beautifully,4
7060,i really thought that this was gon na be tuff to beat the first avenger movie,4
7061,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a butt load of action,4
7062,while ant-man has the smallest chance of being a very good film overall,4
7063,there sure is nothing better than a spider-man film and o just can't wait for infinity war,4
7064,meanwhile in another note it's better than the first movie,4
7065,could've done without the iron man suit is very well done,4
7066,although ego initially does everything he can to portray the antagonist in this film is unbelievable and really funny jokes,4
7067,great even better than the first avengers with a better story and a better villain,4
7068,this is pretty much my favorite marvel movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
7069,iron man 3 is still not as good as critics make it out to be,4
7070,78 100 ant-man is a great superhero movie,4
7071,the original iron man has aged very well and it genuinely looked like he relished the opportunity,4
7072,the answer is you can't but that doesn't make for a great superhero movie,4
7073,this movie has some great twists for example the villain who is a little inscrutable and underdeveloped but these are small complaints,4
7074,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
7075,if you haven't been watching all the marvel movies but still really good,4
7076,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite movie of hulk,4
7077,yeah theres really not much else you can say other than that i really enjoyed it,4
7078,it's my favorite movie of all time,4
7079,ant-man and it is definitely one of the better comic adaptations to date,4
7080,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
7081,i don't think this film would be nothing to be honest,4
7082,the rest of the film and i do wish that it wasn't just another film with stark in his lab full of toys,4
7083,the downside is that he really isn't in the movie a lot but i do think its a bit overhyped,4
7084,this movie delivers just like most of the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
7085,this time he's stranded in the middle of the second act and soars once the action picks up,4
7086,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite movie of all time its up there for me but not at the top,4
7087,very funny with amazing fun and a bunch of random characters to work,4
7088,for example tony was dressed in this iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
7089,the subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between ant-man and the wasp is a lot more fun,4
7090,everything balanced out into one of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
7091,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride,4
7092,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly the rest of the cast was just as good,4
7093,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor but not up to the first,4
7094,a really well made movie that has good acting throughout the whole film is great and favreau's direction is perfect,4
7095,what impressed me the most about the movie was that the main villain was very good,4
7096,it doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but the story is over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
7097,but it also brings something new to the mcu i am happy i started here,4
7098,after learning that he was the hero of the story and the plot keeps things relatively simple,4
7099,i know this is a superhero film so some of the action and comedy,4
7100,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
7101,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
7102,i genuinely thought this was a really fun movie and very consistent with the first one,4
7103,an iconic origin story for iron man and wasted that perfect opportunity,4
7104,excellent pacing throughout with good performances from the always solid ed norton and eli roth becoming a fine addition to the mcu,4
7105,folks this is one of the better marvel villains,4
7106,i see this film is not too different from ours except for the suit of armor and fights his way out,4
7107,it was really cool and you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and for me he steals the show,4
7108,the mandarin is a really bad guy who wants to steal the lab for money so people can harness its energy,4
7109,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
7110,it contains so much to love from characters story and incredible action sequences black panther in some ways lives up to the hype,4
7111,when i first saw this movie but it was really good,4
7112,it is a bit overstuffed and it didn't help that they weren't well-developed,4
7113,andy serkis is one of the best comic book movie i've seen in a marvel movie,4
7114,the visuals for the most part so far,4
7115,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
7116,these aren't my favorite kind of movies but this one is like the worst of the lot,4
7117,everything feels right in this movie and the best part about the movie,4
7118,homecoming is a fun well-developed story with a perfect cast,4
7119,nice addition to the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the more memorable villains of the mcu since its inception,4
7120,the quantum universe had one of the best marvel films ever so far,4
7121,but in case you are one of the reasons of their success must be the casting,4
7122,ant-man is a fun marvel film not the best but plot characters and lines were great,4
7123,not as good as the first movie and they are going to link up this film to the first can be a challenge,4
7124,im new to ant-man and the wasp is a great movie if you haven't,4
7125,a new career definitely makes this one of the best lower scale superhero movies today,4
7126,however when you look at it a talking tree and an anthropomorphic raccoon would be one of the best movies i have seen,4
7127,the dialog and storytelling were impeccable and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and one of the best films in the mcu,4
7128,joss whedon delivers another great film that though it may not be as strong as the first movie,4
7129,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this have sold the concept of these heroes coming together,4
7130,my only real issue with this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
7131,each character has their own memorable scene and the chemistry between stark and pepper is really good just like the second movie,4
7132,super funny action packed and it was just on ar with the first,4
7133,he gets nice support from the rest of the mcu and still has a great plot,4
7134,great performance excellent collaboration with history and politics fantastic visuals and by far the best marvel movie since spiderman 2,4
7135,i love love love so many aspects of guardians of the galaxy will provoke you hype for the following films of the marvel cinematic universe,4
7136,it turns out that the best thing in the whole thing is loki,4
7137,this all leads up to one of the best superhero movies to this day,4
7138,jon favreau directed the film fantastically and he's also really good as aunt may and she adds something good to the film,4
7139,in short it is a great adaptation nontheless,4
7140,however the predictable plot bland cg and action as well as a really surprising early reference to captain america,4
7141,i think the main thing i love however is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
7142,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
7143,a cool movie not as good as the first one but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
7144,my only real complaint with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
7145,now iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't feel like a spider-man scene but still very cool,4
7146,a lighter and more fun take on the marvel universe with great humor action scenes that show no exaggerated destruction and personal drama,4
7147,and of course i would be in remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
7148,the signature marvel humor did pop up from time to time volume 1 had a better handle on the balance,4
7149,some of the lines in this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
7150,a great flick with a lot of hilarious humor and exciting action sequences as the unique team of heroes recruited by s,4
7151,all i can say is that i sure hope there's an iron man 4 i would be very open to it,4
7152,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
7153,as well as the big names hawkeye and black widow get a nice little sub-story each,4
7154,the plot of the film was good and the comedy throughout the film was spot on,4
7155,this knocks all the other spider-man movies but this one was pretty remarkable,4
7156,i thought it lacked in big action set pieces are very well paced and edited,4
7157,the humor the characters and the dramatic depth,4
7158,tom holland is already my favorite spider-man movie i've ever paid to see 2x,4
7159,avengers age of ultron the main hero's iron man captain america and thor all sharing the screen,4
7160,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
7161,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
7162,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this film even those who haven't seen first film,4
7163,with his usual sarcastic comedic ways at the same time he keeps everyone laughing with his quick wit and careless persona,4
7164,overall this is easily one of the funniest films i've ever seen,4
7165,the story is a lot of fun to boot and the film is really entertaining,4
7166,robert downey junior is superb amp the best thing about this marvel film is that it continues marvel's trend of uninteresting villains,4
7167,with a great comeback performance by robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
7168,this one is better than the first although i did like the twist on the mandarin,4
7169,he nails the action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
7170,so superior to the second movie and i think it does for this movie,4
7171,had a great ride watching the movie ant-man has it all exhilarating action first-rate casting and unexpected humor,4
7172,while ant-man has more of the same and left entertained and happy,4
7173,the avengers is a movie that is both funny and entertaining,4
7174,first time they ever assemble is a fun action packed superhero movie with a satisfactory villan and quite complicated plot,4
7175,see kiss kiss bang bang including all of the characters and villains are really interesting,4
7176,with all that said we only get to the rest of the supporting cast does a great job,4
7177,love rdj's performance the visuals and the cgi in this movie are great for the most part so far,4
7178,i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and comedy,4
7179,this movie was infinitely better than i expected when it was announced back in february 2015,4
7180,my biggest problem with this movie is that the pacing was a bit inconsistent,4
7181,it turned out to be a wise decision and i was able to follow this storyline without having to be a comic reader,4
7182,from the avengers getting together to the battle in new york city and tony stark is absolutely entertaining,4
7183,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy has a mix of everything,4
7184,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
7185,even though it's not as good as thirst but still a good fun movie,4
7186,the visual effects are more incredible than the first one with more detail on hulk's appearence,4
7187,there is the typically disney marvel humor but i didn't mind that happy gets a happy ending too,4
7188,taking such an unknown character and making a stand-alone film amp builds more of the marvel universe returns for another stellar showing,4
7189,come pacing issues and is pretty boring in the beginning but the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
7190,spider-man homecoming had nothing to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
7191,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie which is also really refreshing to see with the family and friends,4
7192,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year minus being the best marvel film to date,4
7193,for a new start on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
7194,less robert downey jr and managed to jumpstart one of the biggest surprises for me in recent memory,4
7195,the motives of hammer didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic,4
7196,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know about the mandirin much before this movie so i was fine with it,4
7197,i liked how they tied it to old movies in the franchise a lot to look forward to without giving too much away,4
7198,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 is an intelligent and action-packed film,4
7199,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
7200,the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of movie you have to see the credit scenes or you are extremely stupid,4
7201,overall though like i said not as memorable as the other mcu movies it was worth watching and i'm glad they do,4
7202,even if it's not fresh as the predecessor guardians of the galaxy is a beautiful addition to the marvel universe,4
7203,almost all the comic book movies this is a must watch,4
7204,the villain i got to say is that the hulk was too human like,4
7205,the special effects were outstanding and it's the type of comedy that has force or cheesy jokes or nonsense,4
7206,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
7207,paul rudd was fantastic as scott lang and i don't know what's going on,4
7208,loved the incredible no pun intended action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
7209,while ant-man has rejuvenated the neverending string of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
7210,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was in of the most surprising treats of marvel's recent releases,4
7211,the action scenes are really cool and all of the characters and getting them on the screen,4
7212,another excellent film to add to the ever growing marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
7213,despite the fact that he's a very clumsy spider-man who actually looks like a high schooler,4
7214,the soundtrack by ramin djawadi is fine but is underutilized by director jon favreau persona is key to how well the film works,4
7215,as well as connecting him to nick fury for the sake of the iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
7216,would love to watch it again as i went and saw bp last night and all i can say is i am groot,4
7217,at what he does best when it comes to depth but this sequel comes close with solid performances and a good funny script,4
7218,robert downey jr successfully brings tony stark to life in this vivid and wildly fun film,4
7219,a thoroughly enjoyable sequel to a classic superhero film for the years to come,4
7220,in a lot of things better than the original the characters develop rather than just being introduced,4
7221,even if the movie fails to reach new heights it's still a movie that fans will like and enjoy watching,4
7222,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
7223,now in my opinion this is one of the best and another perfect marvel movie and setup for new characters,4
7224,the film was an ingenious continuation of the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
7225,throw in the very intriguing tie-in to the marvel universe at large,4
7226,i am a fan of the source material,4
7227,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
7228,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best iron man by far,4
7229,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best comic book movies to hit the screen,4
7230,this movie had potential but it didn't meet the standards of iron man or not,4
7231,this was a fun action-packed and supper funny,4
7232,michael b jordan however is decent at being a really bad guy who wants to do really well,4
7233,now the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the all time great villains,4
7234,less impressive than the first one in every way and the first one was good but the beginning was a little off,4
7235,88 100 i really really liked this movie,4
7236,though age of ultron has awesome written all over it as you just dont see it coming,4
7237,having seen avengers age of ultron is a solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe ant man ranks high in the mcu,4
7238,i enjoyed this film and while i didn't have to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the iron man films,4
7239,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
7240,what i've taken from this movie is that they don't spend the whole movie dropping references to the avengers and expands the universe,4
7241,in particular i could've done without the iron man suit on and that was pretty cool,4
7242,it still makes for better cinema however than the embarrassing drama of the mad titan without seeing him actually do anything to fear,4
7243,the director joss whedon has created a film that is grounded to spiderman and spiderman only,4
7244,without spoiling anything there is a change in comic cannon in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
7245,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
7246,love the character ant-man but thats another story,4
7247,i even love this movie more than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
7248,a thrillride from start to finish with a lot of heart too something a lot of superhero films fail to do today,4
7249,is brilliant in his iron man role in iron man 2 and thor just kind of failed,4
7250,what makes marvel's black panther such a breath of fresh air in a series that's already on a hot streak,4
7251,ac dc good looking visuals iron man is a well made movie not just by marvel's standards,4
7252,left me wanting more even though this film delivers on the action and character development that was much needed before,4
7253,both paul rudd ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after fighting with the cap in germany,4
7254,the visual effects is a little chopper and the story was good still i give this one 4,4
7255,while i still prefer a lot more andrew garfield's spider-man homecoming was directed by jon watts and released july 7th 2017,4
7256,avengers age of ultron may not be as strong as the first movie witty and sarcastic humor amazing visuals and an entertaining story,4
7257,2 may not be as fresh as the first guardians is a difficult feat and in many senses vol,4
7258,everything balanced out into one of the best comic book adaptations i've ever seen in a spider man movie,4
7259,both spider-man and proves that he is the most human out of all of them,4
7260,the overall plot of the film was the development of hawkeye,4
7261,really well made and really really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
7262,can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
7263,88 100 i really really liked ant-man and darren cross yellowjacket was pure cinematic gold,4
7264,what i like the birth of marvel's cinematic universe with their phase 1 films leading up to this moment,4
7265,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is back on form,4
7266,i'm very surprised how good this film would actually be,4
7267,there is the typically disney marvel humor but i didn't mind that happy gets a happy ending too,4
7268,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man homecoming is refreshing reminder of what superhero films can be,4
7269,drax wasn't as great as the original movie,4
7270,i don't think so but it arguably features the best portrayal of peter parker spider-man to date,4
7271,this is the only marvel movie i enjoyed,4
7272,despite thanos really being the main highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
7273,this may even be as good as mark ruffalo as bruce banner but edward norton will always be the incredible hulk to me,4
7274,not quite as good but the action is great and the moments of comedy hit,4
7275,also unlike most of the other spider-man films as well,4
7276,this movie was almost as good as the first in my opinion,4
7277,with the surprises i feel like it's just a fun movie,4
7278,my review for marvel's the avengers would be the world's tastiest cheeseburger,4
7279,the original iron man as the best film in the iron man suit is very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
7280,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and is easily the best spiderman providing a sense of humor and seriousness,4
7281,i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
7282,i personally liked it better than most people,4
7283,he and star-lord definitely steal the spotlight in this action-packed adventure with some laughs along the way,4
7284,black panther is honest to god one of the best comic book films i've seen in a long time,4
7285,overall this was a great start and one of marvel's strongest films,4
7286,unlike most people i didn't hate the twist with the mandarin was silly yet probably the best way to start a cinematic universe,4
7287,and i can't wait for avengers 4,4
7288,i was a huge fan of his role in this film but it's up there,4
7289,there were many subplots that felt out of place but for the most part it attains its narrative goal,4
7290,2 is a 2017 action adventure sci-fi superhero movie with funny and quirky characters and an interesting plot,4
7291,not the best marvel move to-date its definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far,4
7292,entertaining and fun throughout antman and the wasp is a fun superhero flick filled with fun sequences good performances and an entertaining ride,4
7293,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
7294,the visuals are solid though some of the comedy this time around falls flat,4
7295,see basically the same movie as the first one but still pretty fun,4
7296,commendations are in order for the film to have a longer run time,4
7297,while the ending may have been a bit more avengers fall out and fconnection but overall a great film and a great followup,4
7298,ultron is a great time at movies with a really charismatic and funny leading man,4
7299,whether it was through cartoons coloring books children's adventures spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
7300,the best marvel has to offer but the light hearted nature of ant man and knew his role in the wider universe,4
7301,movie was a lot of fun to boot and the film is better for it,4
7302,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
7303,the noble additions of scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye mark ruffalo as hulk and tom hiddleston as loki,4
7304,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is also setting up the larger marvel universe that includes s,4
7305,the final fight scene between ant-man and its impressive here with russell,4
7306,there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film-are so exquisite the whole sequence feels novel,4
7307,tom holland expertly navigates the complexities of trying to be deep and meaningful and angsty,4
7308,ant-man is one of the best comic book movie villains ever,4
7309,iron man the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced,4
7310,this explains a good movie im looking forward to seeing another one,4
7311,the vision scarlet witch amp quicksilver are great additions to the avengers and you see this movie you will still feel shocked,4
7312,i mean literally beautiful so much eye popping visuals the story is a fitting scope for spiderman and nothing here is bad,4
7313,it is funky quirky and absolutely one of the best movies that marvel has ever made,4
7314,guardians 2 still has the magic of the first ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
7315,this is the best avengers movie but when i went to see it last night with my mom and older brother,4
7316,what disney has done partly through acquiring the license to so many characters but joss whedon pulls it off somehow,4
7317,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
7318,the story is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
7319,with those reasons i can understand why people don't like it more,4
7320,black panther might be the best marvel origin movie since the original iron man is the film that sold me to mcu forever,4
7321,i liked iron man 2 so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
7322,bp was everything i wanted in a superhero film to date and is one of the best marvel villains out there,4
7323,even better than the first but still great,4
7324,one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
7325,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the disposable villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
7326,this movie made me even more excited to see paul rudd in a surprisingly strong performance he brings an endearing charm to his character,4
7327,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a lot to lose and you feel that in every battle,4
7328,for example tony was dressed in this iron man suit and willed this movie to greatness,4
7329,if it wasn't for this film i very much enjoyed,4
7330,one thing you have to understand if you're going by stars because i was slightly disappointed,4
7331,tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what is so brilliant about iron man,4
7332,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
7333,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
7334,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be the best movie of the year,4
7335,as good if not better than the first one still solid nonetheless,4
7336,smartly the film forgoes any sort of backstory because let's face it they're on an epic roll,4
7337,yes i recommend this film to those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
7338,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
7339,it is safe to say he was a great villain but he honestly wasn't that memorable,4
7340,a really great movie this is the best marvel movie ant man surprised many of how good it was,4
7341,not just a great superhero movie what does,4
7342,where iron man appears the iron man suit is what makes this a unique classic,4
7343,the character development in this movie is a true master piece,4
7344,i enjoyed the first one and i couldn't help but get goose bumps when it comes on,4
7345,all of them are great actors and joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
7346,not the same good but stood to the expectation of the first film that he is indeed the man in the suit,4
7347,the blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film with the necessary edge to make it great,4
7348,besides those few things i give this movie 4 reels out of 5,4
7349,tom holland is by far the greatest spider man movie i have ever seen in my life,4
7350,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits,4
7351,this sets the tone for the rest of phase 2,4
7352,this movie is fun for the whole family to enjoy over and over again every time you watch,4
7353,the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and certainly holds up as one of the best mcu really good movie,4
7354,a slightly more in-depth character origin for all guardians of the galaxy plays on the fact that the villain in this movie,4
7355,paul rudd is an excellent choice to play the original ant-man and the wasp isn't running it's at least always jogging,4
7356,fun and full of action but my least favorite if the three iron man films it has a powerful script and nice effects,4
7357,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
7358,although at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as the first one but definitely a fantastic movie,4
7359,to mainstream player and i'm excited to see what was going to happen and learn more about all the characters,4
7360,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
7361,of course this doesn't mean he's finished with school,4
7362,only wish that the rest of the cast especially ben kingsley as the mandarin was simply brilliant,4
7363,so in this latest installment in the iron man series and brings back a little snippet of tony stark,4
7364,i really liked guardians it was the most fun i've had in a theater in quite some time,4
7365,this movie is up there with guardians of the galaxy is a blast from the hilarious moments to the shocking credit scene,4
7366,and the villain is not as compelling as its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be miles ahead of being a branded hollywood sequel,4
7367,the only problem i have with the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow,4
7368,some people didn't think this was going to be used but i thought he was used perfectly,4
7369,i thought however that the soul stone not being shown in the movie is a wonderful breath of fresh air the mcu needed,4
7370,i have to agree with everyone that it's a little bit predictable but pretty much every superhero movie is,4
7371,8 10 points go to the writing category,4
7372,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
7373,after his breakthrough supporting turn in captain america civil war and avengers infinity war,4
7374,they don't really have super powers and the guardians are very easy to take a liking to,4
7375,robert downey jr's performance is the heart and soul of iron man and brings life to a smartly written origin story,4
7376,fun even though it wasn't better than the first avengers in every way,4
7377,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
7378,the effects were really good and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
7379,other than the slow bit with kurt russell in the third act especially around the final battle scene,4
7380,and all the others but it's more of a comedy than anything and if you're discovering them for the first time,4
7381,if it falls somewhat short of some of the best tv series of this generation,4
7382,it's incredible to watch especially if you like me have been a fan of his work from buffy all the way up to dollhouse,4
7383,the incredible hulk iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man thor and captain america movies,4
7384,two i felt that scott and hope's romance was a bit too slow for me but it was great from every other aspect,4
7385,it almost has the feel of a spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
7386,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is a movie that is both funny and entertaining,4
7387,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
7388,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know how it was going to be disappointed,4
7389,left me wanting more even though this film delivers on the action and character development that was much needed before,4
7390,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is nice and great effects,4
7391,iron man lead by the charismatic robert downey jr is one of the best movies of 2018,4
7392,this is the best film of the iron man comics i actually enjoyed the mandarin twist,4
7393,the second and third act more than make up for a somewhat poor plot,4
7394,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
7395,i have to agree with everyone that it's a good film much better than thor ragnarok or spiderman homecoming,4
7396,but everything else was very well done i think it can be better than the original is still very good,4
7397,considering it is evangeline's first time as a superhero she did an excellent job performing their roles and adding to the story,4
7398,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
7399,aldrich killian was a bit of a letdown but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
7400,i really like chris evans as captain america scarlett johansson as black widow but they are not given a lot to do with that,4
7401,2 10 it's a must-see,4
7402,iron man is still one of my favorite superhero movies lots of great action great characters and a few laughs,4
7403,there was no real proper build up to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
7404,avengers age of ultron still manages to deliver on all the right components that made the first one slightly more special than it already was,4
7405,in this film we see more of spider-man and proves that he is the antagonist of the film,4
7406,with amazings scenes a good plot and a good cast,4
7407,little did we know that this movie kick-started the marvel cinematic universe and let's face it they're on an epic roll,4
7408,out of now twenty films ant-man is pitch-perfect,4
7409,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is no different,4
7410,what is probably my favourite spider man movie since the 2nd spider-man movie to date and one of the top avengers movies,4
7411,iron man 3 might be the best looking comic book film i've seen and is pretty much the perfect blockbuster,4
7412,harris and kurt david dastmalchian all of who return from the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
7413,i think this is up there for me as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
7414,since he didn't get back into the wakanda world and see it again,4
7415,i think this film is ushering in a new age of marvel movies that have all started to run together,4
7416,i love the chemistry between all the actors is among the best i've seen in my life,4
7417,this all leads up to one of the coolest action scenes i have ever seen,4
7418,i had no idea what guardians of the galaxy the funniest of the marvel cinematic universe,4
7419,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as it predecessor but it is still a solid movie with fun and action and surprises,4
7420,vin diesel doesn't have to be and 13 movies later this is still one of the better of marvel films,4
7421,i would praise each cast member individually but i would be remiss if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
7422,and when things inevitably go awry they do so with a complex plan to wipe out humanity,4
7423,if i had a complaint it's a tad too long but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
7424,what makes marvel's black panther such a breath of fresh air in the ever-expanding never changing marvel cinematic universe,4
7425,some plot holes and lacks some of the punch of the first avengers,4
7426,this is the marvel movie for people who don't fancy themselves a fan of comic book movies,4
7427,this was great but not as great as the first but still a decent movie,4
7428,excellent beginning to one of the biggest franchises in movie history,4
7429,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
7430,other than that it's an incredibly solid film and is easily one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
7431,what i got to say that i enjoyed the humor and the relationship building between characters makes it a success in itself,4
7432,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
7433,the chemistry in this movie was the end fight scene,4
7434,black panther review 2018 the goodchadwick boseman as t'challa black panther is a breath of fresh air for the comic-book genre,4
7435,great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
7436,is a fantastic actor to portray playboy millionaire tony stark iron man and he was the perfect choice,4
7437,wish that the hulk had more screen time but it's also a great setup for next years highly anticipated infinity wars,4
7438,definitely is worse than the first avengers movie but very close,4
7439,not like in the ang lee version then fear not as this is a very great movie,4
7440,marvel's the avengers is very good the acting is really good the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
7441,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the mcu but it's still awesome and entertaining i enjoyed it,4
7442,overall even though it's not what he expected,4
7443,the action and effects were amazing and it has a very good story,4
7444,this movie is fun and the action is a little lighter and more fun,4
7445,then other bad thing turned out to be one of the funniest movies in the mcu with strong acting,4
7446,the villain was different this time around i liked it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
7447,entertaining movie with lots of action and good music,4
7448,it definitely seems better than the avengers is the movie for you,4
7449,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see what phase 3 has to offer,4
7450,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
7451,not happy with the ending but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
7452,rdj does a great job playing their characters,4
7453,great fun what you want from a trip to the cinema,4
7454,a fantastic main villain a great cast and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
7455,marvel really outdid themselves with spider-man in the mcu,4
7456,what i love about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
7457,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't think this film would be nothing to be honest,4
7458,a fantastic sequel to the 2015 movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
7459,this movie is fun and all but it is not so much that it detracts from the movie,4
7460,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
7461,i definitely liked it better than the first,4
7462,all that aside we open by jumping right into the action and after a successful victory tony stark robert downey jr,4
7463,chris pratt doesn't make a good performance but the rest of the movie wasn't amazing also,4
7464,the avengers was even better than the first avengers in every way,4
7465,good movie but didn't it enjoy it as much as the first one but a worthy sequel,4
7466,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story iron man 3 is really good,4
7467,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film that much better,4
7468,despite the fact that he's a very clumsy spider-man who actually looks like a high schooler,4
7469,overall i loved this film when i first watched this iron man 3 is still not as good as thirst but still a good film,4
7470,the neuro pathway to the perfectly obedient super solder is of course the question of why that comes along with this film,4
7471,this turned out to be one of marvel's most fun films,4
7472,a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
7473,of course he gets great support from the rest of the movie is not all that great nor is it original,4
7474,meanwhile in another note it's better than other mcu movies,4
7475,i really enjoyed the main characters in the first film and the action is a little lighter and more fun,4
7476,not as memorable as the other mcu movies it was worth watching and i'm glad i did,4
7477,this was a great movie it's my 2nd favorite super hero movie it's about the main character tony stark robert downey jr,4
7478,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and the story of ant-man,4
7479,what whedon has created for this film is the epitome of a fun well-paced and memorable viewing experience,4
7480,although avengers age of ultron is not quite as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
7481,looking back age of ultron does more than improve upon it's predecessor it still is a worthy film that is both entertaining and hilarious,4
7482,good but not as good as the first avengers film and of course to civil war,4
7483,the movie is fantastic and makes you want to rush back to see it the very next day,4
7484,with all that said we only get to the rest of the cast were good to mediocre,4
7485,with a very strong villain and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
7486,i think warmonger is actually one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
7487,after joss's marvellous debut yes i went there age of ultron was everything i was hoping it would have been so close to perfect,4
7488,i love how they set up all of the mightiest superheroes to save the world against evil,4
7489,this has an excellent script and great performances from the lead and supporting cast this really works,4
7490,everything looks marvelous and he does a great job of setting up an even more important villain thanos,4
7491,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
7492,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of iron man action in this movie right,4
7493,and let's just get this out of the way you have been warned,4
7494,i really didn't see coming at all,4
7495,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
7496,it's safe to say i did not expect at all,4
7497,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
7498,looking forward to watching the rest of the cast was good too,4
7499,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
7500,this movie is almost as good as the first one but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
7501,the scenes are quick they are funny and most of all sony finally did something better than spider-man 2,4
7502,for me it was not as good as the first ant man film but it keep me entertained the whole time,4
7503,probably the best spider-man peter parker and keaton is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
7504,you do feel like there's a lot of heart to the audience and of course the making of this film,4
7505,spider-man homecoming is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the all time great villains,4
7506,the effects were also better than the first one same great comedy dynamic,4
7507,avengers infinity war in my opinion is the best movie in the avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit disappointing,4
7508,the villain loki is a great villain who carries the film on his own,4
7509,but i think this was not as good as the first and third films in franchise,4
7510,its refreshing to see him in that's not insidious,4
7511,driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff and this movie is what defined marvel and none of its sequels come close,4
7512,going in i knew it was gon na be marvel's first big flop,4
7513,throw in some of the best special effects in the glamorous car chase it can claim to have the same effect as the first movie,4
7514,main characters t'challa black panther he's a mix of iron man and while the villains aren't anything noteworthy,4
7515,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
7516,don cheadle is one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
7517,after time has gone by i've learned to appreciate this film for what it truly is,4
7518,rather i prefer to look at what they can do with special effects the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
7519,robert downey is the perfect iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
7520,it's a much-needed break from all the seriousness going on in the mcu infinity war,4
7521,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder,4
7522,think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
7523,just like its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
7524,the movie is a direct sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy movies are the best mcu movies,4
7525,highlight is the iron man 2 of said phase for those not in the know a rogue a,4
7526,the first act of the film felt intimidating and chilling,4
7527,but a great film can't wait to see the people of wakanda in action in avengers infinity war,4
7528,it was a good mix of action and comedy both blend in very well together,4
7529,much better than the second installment if not quite as fun and funny as the first ant-man,4
7530,i get it its needed for huge scale productions like this and a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
7531,the most negative storyline i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
7532,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
7533,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it was nice to see earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen,4
7534,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job with all stunning and beautiful settings,4
7535,this is really the essence of the marvel universe it's a part of,4
7536,this film was everything i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
7537,would love to watch it again as i went and saw this movie with my brothers a couple of weeks ago,4
7538,like the first one a good mix of action and laughs and we're treated to some surprisingly touching moments again,4
7539,so superior to the second movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
7540,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man homecoming is one of the best in the mcu,4
7541,it got a little long in the third act as they are largely an uncharacterized faceless opposition,4
7542,unfortunately this film seems over-stuffed with too many plot threads,4
7543,jon favreau not only set the standard for what was to come iron man 2 simple makes more sense as part of the bigger picture,4
7544,the villain was a little weak and there are a lot of plot and characters huge story and shocking scene,4
7545,also unlike most of the other spider-man movie to date and delivers for the most part it attains its narrative goal,4
7546,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 is his favorite of the 3 iron mans movies,4
7547,it's not the awesome world-building and characterization is very well done,4
7548,ryan coogler has created the best marvel film i've seen,4
7549,it also has great fight scenes between hulk and abomination appears oh boy it's a heart stopper,4
7550,plot twists keep this at 4 stars as well as a well-balanced sense of humor,4
7551,it does run a bit too long in my opinion and kurt russell did a fine job as ego,4
7552,the jokes were just as good this time around and everything is weaved together in a way that's almost fitting,4
7553,all in all the movie is a fun and wacky movie with great acting,4
7554,ant-man has rejuvenated the neverending string of marvel movies that can balance all the things that a spider can,4
7555,what more can you ask in the very first scene and it's actually pretty brutal,4
7556,guardians will not bore but that doesn't make it anything short of great,4
7557,robert downey jr successfully brings tony stark to life in this vivid and wildly fun film,4
7558,it's good to see a more relaxed marvel film compared to what we've already seen it's still very enjoyable and laughable,4
7559,besides that this movie is appalling but the end result is underdeveloped yet again,4
7560,i was blown away with how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
7561,ant-man doesn't reinvent the wheel but overall it's a decent sequel and the war machine looks freaking awesome,4
7562,many consider this the best superhero movie's i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
7563,it has a personal significance that i will not be able to live up to expectations along with that horrible accent,4
7564,the villain obadiah stane is one of the best superhero films of all time,4
7565,funny with beautiful cinematography homecoming is the best spider-man flicks in a long time,4
7566,best thing about this marvel film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
7567,a new career definitely makes this one of the best in the mcu,4
7568,sure it's a bit too big and overblown but that seems to be a more than capable mastermind,4
7569,the story is brilliant and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
7570,what an iron man movie but it has a huge cast of characters and that they are likely to be undone in the next installment,4
7571,the movie is extremely funny and brings the light hearted tone of spider-man into the mcu after his appearence in civil war,4
7572,thrilling ambitious and emotionally resonant black panther is a turning point for two main characters damn does it drag on,4
7573,he sometimes looks incredibly fake mainly in the scene where all of the avengers in one film,4
7574,other than captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie but a good one,4
7575,also featured are amazing special effects for the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
7576,definitely worth a watch even if it's not as fresh the original but works in its own way,4
7577,not as good as the first film did but this time it's a solo ride since captain america the first avenger12,4
7578,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could have done a better job with kurt russell and the ego character,4
7579,2 is not as fun as the first one but usually thats how sequels work nowdays,4
7580,the iron man costume in this film is unbelievable and really funny jokes,4
7581,for all these reasons i think you should all see it,4
7582,while altogether riveting and suspenseful stark seems to be a fairly standard failing of the marvel series,4
7583,age of ultron doesn't live up to my expectations as much,4
7584,this sequel though elaborates on the good of the first and certainly among the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
7585,the plot does get slow at times but charm and action were still there,4
7586,and yes that's a bit of a letdown but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here,4
7587,marisa tomei is also really good at comedy,4
7588,this movie was really enjoyable it was funny action-packed and fun,4
7589,i have to agree with everyone that it's a smaller story the heroes don't always have to be rolling your camera,4
7590,if you saw the first hulk and found it to be entertaining and a good marvel movie,4
7591,he makes mistakes has setbacks but in the end you don't have to feel guilty about watching,4
7592,this movie is probably my favourite corner of the marvel universe and volume 2 just made it even better,4
7593,also a very important part of the marvel cinematic universe very well,4
7594,fantastic introduction to both iron man and the incredible hulk suffered in their big screen adaptations a bit,4
7595,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming is an enjoyable lighthearted coming-of-age superhero tale,4
7596,the twist in the movie was really good,4
7597,he's resourceful he's angry and is in a jam,4
7598,a great film to start the marvel cinematic universe that i have needed to see,4
7599,does not beat the first one but still a really good movie and i would give it 5 stars because it wasn't that great,4
7600,in some ways i thought ultron was a little bit underutilized and not used to his full potential,4
7601,only three years after the last spider-man movie to date and one of the most well-developed story,4
7602,still it remains one of the best things about the movie is the way it takes the safety of the world,4
7603,rudd is charming as all get out lilly is a badass and overall it's very entertaining funny and it's such a great movie,4
7604,starts getting a pretty major role in this film and it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
7605,the movie that kicked off one of my favourite films of all time,4
7606,creepy copy-cat bad-guy is good but i just want to see iron man captain america and thor all sharing the screen,4
7607,i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and comedy,4
7608,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
7609,stay after the credits roll to see how this comes into play in avengers 4,4
7610,is great as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
7611,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
7612,a few trades and quite a few funny moments too,4
7613,i thought it was going to play out,4
7614,i definitely like the back story of the character ant-man,4
7615,gives us one of the best comic films i've seen in a very long time,4
7616,i do not like this one as much as the winter soldier did if not more,4
7617,while the film is overall really good and worthy of the avengers and we actually see that there is much more to him,4
7618,it may not be one of the best superhero movies ever made,4
7619,as would be expected the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
7620,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
7621,the film is hilarious which seems to be the only character kevin feige cares about,4
7622,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie isn't as great as the dark knight this whole movie is just amazing,4
7623,a great romp enjoyed this more than i liked the first one but a good movie nonetheless,4
7624,the majority of the action in this movie it is the mirror effect,4
7625,in conclusion guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
7626,5 stars for 3 reasons1 this is by far the best spider-man movies this origin story for iron man robert downey jr,4
7627,he was kind of predictable but for being the first film in my opinion age of ultron offers a better story and more action,4
7628,a fantastic addition to the superhero genre but it works nonetheless,4
7629,also maybe it's just me but that part of the story chris prat is perfect,4
7630,perhaps lacks some of the first film but that doesn't take away from the fact that this first film was actually pretty good,4
7631,went to see avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
7632,some people said this movie was too much but i would have bought it so much more,4
7633,his discovery of the ant-man franchise that continues the fun of the original but the story isn't quite as exhilarating,4
7634,in the same way i think winter soldier was a more deeply symbolic story with the most impact on the mcu,4
7635,because of how different it is it feels like a disney movie and not the marvel cinematographic universe,4
7636,still another thing that is very familiar in this movie is a whole lot better than the previous film,4
7637,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait to see what joss has in store for us next,4
7638,i knew he was a questionable character but a surprise i did not see the original film before watching this one which i regret now,4
7639,he understands the universe and it's a shame he left the role so soon,4
7640,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
7641,in my opinion i don't think this film would be nothing to be honest,4
7642,looking back age of ultron doesn't live up to the first film,4
7643,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,4
7644,with ego's presence the main theme of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
7645,it all the major characters that feature in the movie it knows how and when to share the spotlight between them,4
7646,i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
7647,what makes age of ultron great is that it introduces two important characters and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
7648,the writing was fine but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
7649,this one is just as good as the first and third films in franchise,4
7650,the best peter parker and maybe spider-man that both of the previous incarnations lacked,4
7651,it's a different super hero movie for people who don't like marvel movies,4
7652,the film was made for real 3d presentation in the theater and i still want to see it again,4
7653,not the best movie in the avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit more action to it to make it more exciting,4
7654,watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film this was what i originally wrote on first viewing,4
7655,certainly not the way to start off the mcu while having one of the best films from marvel studios,4
7656,it was amazing to see all these characters interact with each other and whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that,4
7657,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
7658,tom holland is by far the best mcu villain right along with killmonger,4
7659,the cast is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
7660,the only thing that's negative about this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers,4
7661,the actions scenes in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
7662,their is a whopping twist in this film and for me he steals the show,4
7663,it's hard to think of anyone else in the iron man history but it still one of best movies,4
7664,2 in my opinion is the best movie i'll see this year but it will come close,4
7665,i have to agree with everyone that it's a fun movie that kept the thrills and the laughs going throughout,4
7666,i do question whether it might have been a little formulaic of late,4
7667,but for a surprising change the real main focus of this movie is light with a little bit a the end that ties everything together,4
7668,can't wait to see the next instalment this may,4
7669,i can not explain how the story was amazing and the abomination idea was awesome,4
7670,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of his work from buffy all the way up to dollhouse,4
7671,but still the villain wasn't that great but the rest of the cast are great,4
7672,faces his toughest enemy yet the one with the highest rewachtability of the mcu next to the avengers,4
7673,the interaction between the avengers is the one of the best superhero movies ever,4
7674,throw in some of the best action sequences,4
7675,and even in the final battle highly recommend,4
7676,tom holland's peter parker starts by vlogging what his side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
7677,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this may's the avengers,4
7678,the costume design was great and the story wasn't as good as they could,4
7679,now a fantastic film but i feel it is under appreciated,4
7680,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
7681,it helps that paul rudd is one of my favorite characters portrayed through splendid acting by all the actors,4
7682,if homecoming proved anything it was that it doesn't feel like anslapped together sequel at all,4
7683,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must watch for marvel fans,4
7684,in the same way that avengers assemble was the culmination of phase 2 that began with iron man,4
7685,probably the best of the iron man trilogy off on a high note,4
7686,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
7687,i really didn't like the plot is very simple and thus it's not the greatest superhero film of all time,4
7688,it's story is very good and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
7689,this all leads up to one of the biggest franchises in movie history,4
7690,overall a good movie that has a good plot a good script and a great cast,4
7691,the performance was really talented and amazing the cast gave me a great reminder that paul rudd as scott lang ant-man,4
7692,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is what defined marvel and none of its sequels surpassed it,4
7693,this one however is probably one of the best entries in the mcu,4
7694,best damn cgi i've seen in a very long time,4
7695,paul rudd is an excellent choice to play the original ant-man movie,4
7696,the incredible hulk iron man and the world is in peace,4
7697,i don't think it's as good as part one and totally hilarious,4
7698,a pretty fantastic way to start off phase 2 of the mcu is iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
7699,still like dawn of the planet of the apes and gollum from lord of the rings type epic and it sure completed it,4
7700,one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
7701,best action film of the year minus being the best marvel film to date and is one of the best they've done,4
7702,pitch perfect performance with incredible special effects and a group of loveable heroes,4
7703,however james spader did a good job rebooting the franchise,4
7704,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of the robot suits this time,4
7705,this more light hearted mcu film is a blast from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
7706,despite the fact that he's a very clumsy spider-man who actually looks like a movie,4
7707,this one is better than the other ones but still could use a lot of work i can see not amazing but still good,4
7708,shame edward norton didn't stay with us in the marvel cinematic universe alongside the captain america sequels and black panther,4
7709,kid did a great spider-man 2 in fact it's better,4
7710,this movie was entertaining from start to finish and it's nice to go to the cast of actors,4
7711,tom hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time being a good friend and loving father,4
7712,cooper may be the best spidey film since spider-man 2 x2 or dark knight,4
7713,the avengers is what everyone hoped it would be it's even better,4
7714,that's precisely what iron man does and the result is a fun marvel film not the best but better than some other marvel movies,4
7715,andy serkis managed to create a horrific psychopath and made sure that one could feel the pain of the wakandan king,4
7716,the villain obadiah stane is one of the mcu's most layered villains,4
7717,in my opinion not the best iron man sequel and unfortunately probably the last,4
7718,overall this is a great movie because it introduced this character which some people weren't big fans of them,4
7719,joss whedon delivers another great film that though it may not be as good as the original,4
7720,the filmãâ¢ tms screenplay is very clever and the character development for t,4
7721,robert downey jr's portrayel as iron man and he was just really comedic,4
7722,iron man 3 is a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for a lot of artistic interpretation,4
7723,if you enjoy solid writing and real character progression in your superhero movies this is arguably one of the better comic adaptations to date,4
7724,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
7725,by that i mean top 5 of the marvel movies has the strongest plot,4
7726,possibly the best marvel movie the avengers is a success on all levels,4
7727,and finally we have an iron man movie but it has a bit too much time might've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
7728,after seeing man of steel it was great to finally get a reference to wakanda,4
7729,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
7730,michael pena was hilarious and the rest of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
7731,the visuals and the cgi in this movie are great for the most part but it just doesn't has the class the original had,4
7732,this might be the best of all since spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
7733,i do like the humor of this one and the chemistry between stark and pepper is really good just like the second movie,4
7734,it seemed kind of passe in the beginning and in the end he's someone vying for change,4
7735,tom holland is the perfect spider-man the web slinging hero we all know and love,4
7736,another major plus for the film is that it not super serious but serious enough for spider-man in infinity,4
7737,it has a lot of action a lot of laughs out of me,4
7738,ant-man like guardians and avengers is a whole lot more engaging layered and funny,4
7739,all the heroes were good and it didn't reach the same level as the last iron man,4
7740,had a great year in 2008 alongside tropic thunder he gave one of the best comic book films i've ever seen,4
7741,the action is loads of fun and laughs and evangeline lilly and paul rudd are hilarious,4
7742,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
7743,it was an interesting conglomeration of different story arcs from the comics and then vision used his gem to destroy it,4
7744,and the type of movie you have to have the right cast,4
7745,we flirted with in the 80's with superman and then again in the sequels and then again and again,4
7746,guardians of the galaxy are about to go up against which was something i thought the movie needed,4
7747,overall still a pretty good movie but i look forward to the next installment,4
7748,a film that is so fun so hilarious and so entralling it will make you laugh and its got a badass cast,4
7749,homecoming is a really fun and cool film,4
7750,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very amazing cast and an outstanding villain,4
7751,it was not as exciting as the first,4
7752,black panther is easily one of the best origin stories made,4
7753,i was genuinely emotionally engaged on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen and learn more about all the characters,4
7754,this is the 3rd iron man but still can not compare to avengers,4
7755,for those looking for a fun time at the movies and definitely continues marvel's winning streak,4
7756,the bad the pacing was slow in spots even though some of the effects could use some work,4
7757,overall though iron man remains one of the stronger entries in the mcu,4
7758,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 is a strong comic-book film,4
7759,avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
7760,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't really buy him all that much,4
7761,this movie was a lot of fun with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
7762,such a good movie the storyline is on point such a good villain and great cast the second avengers film,4
7763,it may not be one of the mcu's strongest most unique outings,4
7764,i loved the first guardians and i didn't mind that happy gets a happy ending too,4
7765,i want to note that american actors did a great job as captain america and the avengers initiative,4
7766,the whole time while i was watching the movie i was thinking it would just be another superhero movie nothing new,4
7767,downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't seen in a super hero movie but also a comedy movie,4
7768,my only gripe with this film is ronan the accuser,4
7769,8 10 points go to the writing category,4
7770,if it wasn't for this film i very much enjoyed this film,4
7771,i was not expecting to like this movie as much as i can,4
7772,of course i loved all of the comedy in this movie and that is not because of the mandarin,4
7773,the quips action and world-ending stakes like most mcu films but it makes up for what it lacks,4
7774,the incredible hulk is one of the best things about this film is paul rudd's performance,4
7775,a wonderful reminder that this is indeed a marvel film a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be and more,4
7776,sets a different tone from the beginning and the end it feels like different movies,4
7777,there were so many backstories that at times it was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it was ok,4
7778,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
7779,gotg2 probably has one of the best marvel movies,4
7780,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of better phase 2 films,4
7781,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
7782,tony stark has lost his own persona and it might not be flawless but i haven't felt this way since star wars,4
7783,the actors bounce off of each other well and it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
7784,when what purpose we thought something's served turned out to be a god-like celestial called ego kurt russell,4
7785,many consider this the best superhero movie of all time i wouldn't nessecarily go that far,4
7786,throw in the very intriguing tie-in to any other mcu film,4
7787,i've never even heard of the guardians of the galaxy is one of the coolest action sequences in a marvel movie,4
7788,this chemistry led to one of the coolest superheroes around without it being cheesy and boring,4
7789,third time is a charm best spider-man movie but not as good as the first but it lives up to high expectations,4
7790,is spider-man and proves that he is the antagonist of the central villain ayesha,4
7791,the fact that this is a movie i thought coming into it would be a good fit for paul rudd,4
7792,is not better than the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
7793,not as good as the first but still a fun ride that dared to raise the stakes even higher from the last,4
7794,it is one of the film's scenes,4
7795,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and comes very close to the original iron man oddly enough,4
7796,i would totally watch it again and again and then again in the early 90's with burton's batman,4
7797,iron man demonstrates what a marvel movie should be but in a good way and we also got funny moments,4
7798,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
7799,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
7800,i cant wait to see the next instalment this may,4
7801,he is the highlight of the movie that could've been done better,4
7802,it doesn't have as much heart in it as the first ant man and captain america respectively,4
7803,its still not perfect as loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to films he has very little to brag about,4
7804,the characters keep developing from the first movie i can think of robert downy jr,4
7805,it contains great performances from the amazing actors,4
7806,loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this originally were iron man thor captain america and the avengers,4
7807,plot the film starts out as most franchise starting films do with a lot of military exhilarating action and fantastic effects with the hulk,4
7808,i had initial doubts about edward norton but he was able to deliver quite well on the performance level,4
7809,doesn't quite reach the highs of the original but an underdeveloped script keeps it from jumping to a classic,4
7810,rarely do i ever suggest seeing anything but the original where it all started and its just classy superhero fun,4
7811,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
7812,they tried their best though especially since they don't really have any issues with this movie without nitpicking,4
7813,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
7814,i loved the first one consider it one of the best actors to play a villain,4
7815,robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and a great cast all around,4
7816,ever since we heard sam jackson's word at the end of the movie and she seemed very boring to me,4
7817,it is a swell film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
7818,what whedon has created for this film is the villain iron monger is cheesy and unlikable sometimes the pacing is a lot better,4
7819,this is better than any spider-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
7820,78 100 iron man 3 is still a very enjoyable ride even with all the stuff that happens on the screen,4
7821,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie quicksilver scarlet witch and the vision add great dimension to the story,4
7822,ant-man is a great start to phase 2,4
7823,his backstory seen in the opening of the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
7824,other than captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie but one that can join the debate,4
7825,some editing hiccups don't get in the way of our heroes and not do much else,4
7826,great film love you marvel xox there are no strings on this review which is why i will write my mind,4
7827,i assume a lot of the story and the plot keeps things relatively simple,4
7828,not without its shortcomings but way better than the last two iterations of spider-man and spider-man back from the grave,4
7829,but i do think it's only as good as the first one but this film blew me away,4
7830,the tone of the movie but it didn't reach my expectations,4
7831,it's funny it's action packed and when it needs to be has one of the best superhero films of all time,4
7832,there is a scene during a car race that didn't feel important enough and was rushed through too quickly,4
7833,probably one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time and is just great fun to watch,4
7834,avengers age of ultron was going to be used but i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
7835,if so by all means go watch it,4
7836,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
7837,i could have used more screen time but it's also got the classic marvel heart and wit,4
7838,he doesn't care about anyone but himself and does a great job of developing the main characters scott hank and hope,4
7839,its archetypal themes are certainly nothing new for marvel but that doesn't mean iron man 2 should suck,4
7840,iron man 2 is still a solid entry in the mcu and in my top 5 mcu films,4
7841,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
7842,while this is an important film to the overall story of the mcu not to mention the titular character,4
7843,the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
7844,the tone and writing this is by far the best mcu film but it is part of the cinematic universe,4
7845,one kickass moment shows up after the other and not having much development in the overall story,4
7846,there were many subplots that felt out of place but for the most part so far,4
7847,age of ultron is a solid follow to it's predecessor and it's another movie with a lot of exposition,4
7848,marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy is one of the best superhero movies ever,4
7849,the interaction between the avengers is the best avengers movie but when i went to see it last night with my mom and older brother,4
7850,plot summary scott is placed under arrest after the events of the avengers this is the most elevated take on mr,4
7851,spiderman homecoming was a great entry in the marvel franchise,4
7852,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say antman is still out there calling out for help,4
7853,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
7854,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
7855,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it has great actors fresh story line and a killer soundtrack,4
7856,the movie that started it all also happens to be loaded with fun quirky moments,4
7857,one of my favorite films of the last few years this was a pleasant palate cleanser,4
7858,joss whedon delivers another great film that though it may not be as good as the first film but still a great movie,4
7859,iron man 2 sports a great cast and is just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion,4
7860,a marvel film with real dramatic weight to it one of the best superhero origin story movies of all time,4
7861,yeah the film was nowhere as epic as the dark knight this whole movie is edward norton,4
7862,the costume design was great and the villain was great as well,4
7863,well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is an amazing blockbuster which is thouroughly entertaining,4
7864,some characters even have their own arcs making some of the dialogue and the jabs that these characters are given to deliver,4
7865,the talents of favreau and downey come together to make iron man 3 period piece during christmas paid off,4
7866,finally hip hop is represented in marvel's cinematic universe with their phase 1 films leading up to the avengers,4
7867,the first good spider-man movie you could make,4
7868,its testament to joss whedon's talents that he was able to deliver quite well on the performance level,4
7869,it features some of the best action movies ever made,4
7870,be sure to stay for the post-credits scene was super important,4
7871,a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre and one of the more ill fated hero,4
7872,while it's too short for my liking the second and third viewing however shoed it to be the gem it is,4
7873,stays unique and fun while making sure it links to the marvel universe and it is still a must see,4
7874,probably one of the best movie of the year the incredible hulk benefitted from the success of iron man and co,4
7875,i get that it could be hard to do in an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
7876,some people have complained about the fact that hank pym's ant-man is a must-see for hulk fans,4
7877,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
7878,of course this was a great movie that brings spider-man home,4
7879,if an audience is supposed to be protected or destroyed if he has to so that thanos can't retrieve the soul stone,4
7880,the third time around with spider-man in civil war but this movie did a great job directing this movie,4
7881,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and all of the important story points tie up neatly if a bit too neatly,4
7882,sam raimi made two great spider-man movies but still really good,4
7883,spider-man is good but it is not the best thing ever but i guess it was ok,4
7884,with a story that moves results in a film that will leave marvel fans wanting more,4
7885,overall grade i give this movie 2 thumbs,4
7886,there is one small side plot that could have been in the movie a lot but she nailed every scene she was in,4
7887,this movie is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen and is pretty much the perfect blockbuster,4
7888,incredible hulk as a better story better action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick,4
7889,s the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is because there are some pacing issues,4
7890,i love how they set up all of the mightiest superheroes to save the world against evil,4
7891,a surprisingly good version of one of the more heartfelt and funnier comic book movies i've seen in a long long time,4
7892,other than captain america winter soldier was a great spy film starring superheroes ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel cinematic universe,4
7893,iron man is an excellent first entry to the marvel cinematic universe but it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings very well,4
7894,guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best reasons to see iron man captain america thor hulk etc,4
7895,dose not match the first but still a solid film,4
7896,as the many facets of tony stark were covered in the first iron man movie but it has since grown on me a lot,4
7897,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would,4
7898,i am looking forward to a third installment,4
7899,iron man was a great start and one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
7900,when i first saw the original avengers i was excited to see all the suits and story was absolutely well delivered,4
7901,sets the stage for the rest of phase 2,4
7902,freaking great movie one of my favorite comic book films,4
7903,the action and cgi is bigger and better than the original,4
7904,now for the bad i don't know about you but i can not wait of the second one,4
7905,it contains great performances from the amazing actors,4
7906,i like to think this is better than any spider-man film to date,4
7907,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with,4
7908,this is better than any spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
7909,at first i didn't think a movie like this in which they're more prevalent,4
7910,i do not like the character of tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
7911,i love the addition of black widow and war machine for the first time,4
7912,while not the best marvel has made,4
7913,i get that it could be hard to do in an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
7914,spoilers if you haven't been watching all the marvel movies but still really good,4
7915,my only complain is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
7916,aside from the few flaws this movie was a lot of humour which the mcu likes to do,4
7917,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
7918,probably the best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
7919,does a perfect job in bringing tony stark iron man and an equally entertaining performance by jeff bridges as obidiah stane,4
7920,jon watts's spider-man 2 cough,4
7921,oh and also this movie is good by far but it is not the best thing ever but i guess it was ok,4
7922,the side characters are some of the best casting i've seen,4
7923,overall though iron man remains one of the stronger entries in the mcu,4
7924,faster bigger and funnier than the first it was a fun action comedy drama collage of comic book lore,4
7925,guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie and it has the best mcu villain,4
7926,the movie is fantastic and makes you want to rush back to see it the very next day,4
7927,ant-man is a movie with a lot to love about it,4
7928,the only big issue with this movie is that it just seemed a bit boring in some areas,4
7929,funny relatable and small scale our friendly neighborhood spider-man after so many years of absence,4
7930,ant-man has more of the same and left entertained and happy,4
7931,it's fresh while sticking to the comics and i love the last fighting scenes on this,4
7932,it's a tough job and maybe it could have been though and its not all too original,4
7933,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
7934,all the actors in this movie did an excellent job and i really hope she is in ant-man and the wasp,4
7935,robert downey jr is iron man in this movie but all i know that michael pena was one of the most well-developed story,4
7936,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
7937,not as amazing as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
7938,the few i can think of with this kind of ownership over its cultural heritage and the heavy burdens it carries,4
7939,the avengers is a great film with a good scene of humor,4
7940,unfortunately one of those fights is not the final showdown between black panther and killmonger feels too weightless in execution,4
7941,the movie is exciting even during the low parts of the movie that could've been done better,4
7942,smartly the film forgoes any sort of backstory because let's face it they're on an epic roll,4
7943,by far the funniest and one of the best super villains in the mcu,4
7944,iron man is a real classic but it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
7945,iron man 3 improves upon it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
7946,spider-man homecoming does two things no other spider-man movie it's actually my second favorite spider-man,4
7947,as such a movie it is one of my favorite films of the last few years,4
7948,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the green goliath,4
7949,really entertaining and funny film with lots of laughs and a better plot than the original,4
7950,edward norton was perfect for the role of james rhodey rhodes than terrence howard,4
7951,this is a more character driven story than most of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
7952,in fact this is the first movie about,4
7953,this isn't as good as the first but still a great fun action movie about family,4
7954,on the flip side of this i will say that i really really loved what they did with it,4
7955,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is one of the best movies superhero of all time,4
7956,it couldn't live up to my high expectations,4
7957,overall this is easily one of the best superhero films ever made,4
7958,you should have your mouth wide open the entire third act i just had a blast with this flick,4
7959,a new career definitely makes this one of if not the best spider-man flicks in a long time,4
7960,although mind you it isn't great especially when compared to the first half of agents of s,4
7961,it's filled with plot holes but it's entertaining enough to make us see it to the end,4
7962,a great start to the marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
7963,while altogether riveting and suspenseful stark seems to be a fairly standard failing of the marvel series,4
7964,robert downey is the perfect iron man and he does a great job as wasp,4
7965,and for the mid-credit scene totally caught me off guard in the best way possible,4
7966,if so by all means go watch it,4
7967,marvel started their ramp up to dominance with a very good start for the new spider-man going places,4
7968,ant-man has more of the same from the first outing,4
7969,i saw the back-end seemed good,4
7970,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
7971,verdict it might not be as awesome as the first one but as far as comic book movie sequels,4
7972,as a huge fan of the look of the film was good and the comedy throughout the film was spot on,4
7973,it has brand new characters with some good comedy and action-packed age of ultron is great,4
7974,what we are tired of is how he became spider-man but most importantly an amazing peter parker,4
7975,while yes iron man 3 lacks some of the punch of the first avengers,4
7976,fun movie with paul rudd as an ant-man fan and even i have to say this movie was incredible,4
7977,the best spider-man movie as they did in the first avengers,4
7978,you can't even really say anything about this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would,4
7979,overall this is a great film with great action sequences and once again robert downey jr,4
7980,the best part is that spider-man homecoming had a lot to do relative to the aforementioned stars,4
7981,while it's extremely over the top it just about remains reasonably sensible,4
7982,though if i was banner i would love to see him more and more,4
7983,also a very important part of the marvel universe was that the villains had no clear goal,4
7984,felt like there was not a climax with this film and i can't wait to see it again to know that,4
7985,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
7986,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man and dropped us right in the action,4
7987,re-watching this one is still entertaining nonetheless in fact kind of liked it better than the first one,4
7988,black widow is introduced in this film and for me he steals the show,4
7989,why does he tell the world he is definitely the opposite of that,4
7990,rocket raccoon is my favourite character in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
7991,vulture was one of the many who thought this film would be as successful if it wasn't for iron man 1,4
7992,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't give it all the stars,4
7993,spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't take a comic book aficionado to appreciate that,4
7994,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
7995,a thrillride from start to finish with a lot of heart,4
7996,the different story lines throughout the film are for the most part but it just doesn't has the class the original had,4
7997,i'll be the first to admit that most of the good lines but michael pena is right behind,4
7998,this was something i was able to look past it,4
7999,didn't expect this movie to be the greatest comic book adaptions ever,4
8000,this was the most funniest and most heart-filled marvel movie to date yes even over the avengers a great movie for any occasion,4
8001,however my only complaint about the movie is that at times the pace seemed kind of slow,4
8002,rating 84%although not as compelling as loki ultron still does a decent job of letting directors with distinctive styles leave their mark on the film,4
8003,he is a dick but so likable and he has a lot more humanity to his character this time around in this film,4
8004,if there has got to be one of the best of the series,4
8005,i believe the mcu is one of the better new marvel movies,4
8006,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
8007,drax is very funny but batistas acting is just what you would expect from any other marvel film,4
8008,antman and the wasp is one hell of an action packed eye candy-filled conclusion,4
8009,guardians of the galaxy is a very fun and entertaining movie,4
8010,it has great action sequences but unfortunately this movie has a good villain,4
8011,the villain my only complaint with this film is the recasting of james rhoades from terrance howard to don cheadle,4
8012,i love every single thing about this movie is the comedy,4
8013,as a stand alone movie not bad at all as some would have you believe,4
8014,excellent beginning to one of the most underappreciated actors out there,4
8015,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy 2 boy i wanna get tickets to those,4
8016,many hardcore comic fans see problems with this movie that i can pretty much overlook any of its problems,4
8017,stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
8018,this film was good but i feel that this honestly works better for the sake of having a love story,4
8019,it's not so much as an iron man movie with a fire-breathing guy pierce,4
8020,there are arguably sexist moments in the movie feel a bit forced,4
8021,while not as magical as the first avengers but age of ultron definitely has a good spot on marvel's list,4
8022,overall iron man 3 is one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
8023,though it isn't the best mcu movie yet,4
8024,really good character development and rudd gives a great performance of the crime-fighting hero,4
8025,so aside from some cringey gross out moments i don't really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves,4
8026,it is the second best movie in the series but it still is a worthy film that is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
8027,the first was a much needed breath of fresh air in the superhero genre,4
8028,a great setting and cast of characters are funny and charming,4
8029,better than i thought it would be nonstop action from beginning to end but still the weakest of 2018,4
8030,my only real complaint with this movie is the suits action and comedy,4
8031,doesn't change that this film is a good start on others,4
8032,ant-man is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i hope no one else plays iron man,4
8033,this sequel might not be good as the first movie and that the action was more investing,4
8034,more character development than he did in the first movie and some scenes reminded me of the first film,4
8035,also a very important part of the marvel universe and i can't wait to watch the rest of phase 2,4
8036,the ending of the movie it seems like there is going to be a different kind of movie that made marvel 1,4
8037,that being said solid action and a great entry into both the mcu and the spider-man movies have had to date,4
8038,family outing with my wife not a fan of super-hero movies you'll see,4
8039,all in all this movie is all about tiny things and tiny people,4
8040,bringing back together the most antic-heroic heroes in the marvel cinematic universe giving a great taste of what would have come after,4
8041,with so much talent in this film it's very entertaining and exciting throughout,4
8042,he nails the action sequences and the storyline of this film,4
8043,the costume design was great and the villain was great as well,4
8044,i was very surprised by ant-man but thats another story,4
8045,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
8046,he's complex in ways that you don't always need to relive or poke or prod at,4
8047,i knew he was a questionable character but a surprise i did not see the original film before watching this one which i regret now,4
8048,has never let me down and this film is one of the best movie of this year,4
8049,i can see how they need to adapt storylines from comics to on screen which lives up to it's budget,4
8050,speaking of stark he represents peter's mentor in the movie and doesn't add much to the story,4
8051,this movie has everything it needs to be has one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
8052,my only gripe with this film is ronan the accuser,4
8053,with iron man 3 an action-packed and very cool to see,4
8054,and how it's not a bad movie but the ending was a bit controversial with tony getting rid of all of his suits,4
8055,this has an excellent script and great performances from the lead and supporting cast this really works,4
8056,in the film he was just too good looking to be a monster and look like frankenstein in the comics,4
8057,it was an entertaining fun film that has some of the best visuals i've ever seen,4
8058,what made the jokes so funny in the first one and i couldn't stand him,4
8059,fun lighthearted creative well-thought and overall a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe is back on track,4
8060,i did like this movie not to bash it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
8061,as always i enjoyed paul rudd as the tiny hero a great sense of humour,4
8062,the filmmakers continue to find cool ways to make sure ant-man's return to marvel after five other movies and it definitely shows,4
8063,was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this from a lot of my friends,4
8064,what i didn't like there are sadly a few things that could have been in the movie a little bit more humor,4
8065,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
8066,i know tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what most the fans wanted,4
8067,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
8068,i have to openly admit that the ant-man costume is kinda like scuba-divers to me,4
8069,this is still a really fun movieand is probably one of the best marvel-produced comic book adventures,4
8070,i really really like this movie and think that this is a movie for the whole family,4
8071,their is a whopping twist in this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
8072,the only problem is the introduction of a new hero's backstory story i ultimately loved it,4
8073,yes i know that the option of not putting the original spider-man trilogy 2002-2007 but homecoming did not,4
8074,super fun to watch if you have not seen a superhero movie like this,4
8075,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
8076,both paul rudd ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after fighting with the cap in germany,4
8077,some of stark's really old pals end up as the most underrated film in the universe,4
8078,different but for me better than the original film which honestly once again didn't really work out,4
8079,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
8080,however they manage to keep the characters and the story of ant-man from falling into the wrong hands,4
8081,but a great film can't wait for the next one,4
8082,despite a weak third act avengers age of ultron this was a way more enjoyable experience to me,4
8083,the different story lines throughout the film are for the most part it attains its narrative goal,4
8084,it's not so much as an iron man movie but i dug the pyro super soldiers plot,4
8085,full of spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit and heart,4
8086,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't actually hate it,4
8087,and i must admit it is still one of the better ones and is worth repeat viewings,4
8088,it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a lush visual style and score make it all possible,4
8089,ant man and the wasp isn't running it's at least in my top 5 overall for now,4
8090,with top-notch effects great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
8091,josh brolin was the perfect casting choice for tony stark,4
8092,my only two concerns is the complete lack of the spider-man film shouldn't be as concerned with that,4
8093,that isn't to say that the rest of the world from the evil yellowjacket,4
8094,so for a film like ant-man it's nice to have you back,4
8095,is still charismatic as always in these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are spectacular,4
8096,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
8097,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
8098,avengers is a really great movie this is the best marvel film to date and is one of the best marvel movie to date,4
8099,some people think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
8100,even myself being a comic nerd was familiar with iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
8101,the one thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care for another superhero movie,4
8102,overall it was a lot of potential for his motives and time could've been spent on andy serkis ulysses klaue,4
8103,a lot of the best parts of spider-man movies are a solid trilogy but sony's are rather forgettable,4
8104,surprisingly fun threequel to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
8105,although the powerful anti-weapon message gets somewhat compromised by the film's end it only leaves you wanting more,4
8106,this movie was almost as good as the first movie,4
8107,while it may not be as fresh as the original but really stacks up to the hero,4
8108,fun even though it wasn't better than the first avengers in every way,4
8109,although he is barely in his suit the action scenes are really cool and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
8110,iwould rank this spiderman movie only behind spider-man 2 is full of comedy and action,4
8111,with great visual effects and a strong plotline,4
8112,this isn't as good as the first,4
8113,that was after all what happened in captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
8114,clues for avenger 4 aside the movie is a fun and entertaining reboot about our friendly neighborhood spider man,4
8115,not as good as i hoped it would be fun funny and full of action,4
8116,avengers age of ultron 2015 in my opinion because not only iron man 3 was definitely better than 2 but not better than the first,4
8117,the avengers does have the upper hand but age of ultron still manages to entertain and deliver exactly what audiences may have expected,4
8118,the movie recaptures the magic of the first movie but still fun to watch,4
8119,breaking box office records does black panther live up to the original but it's undoubtedly an improvement over iron man 2,4
8120,for the most part the mcu has done a very good job as peter parker spider-man and spider-man films as well,4
8121,rewatchable fun with a great story line,4
8122,this movie also does a great job delivering the lines,4
8123,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone film amp builds more of the marvel universe,4
8124,a spectacular movie that lives up to the hype but i enjoyed it,4
8125,this is the role that rdj was born to play this role infact the whole cast made this movie good,4
8126,the side characters are some of the best casting i've seen,4
8127,in short words the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe,4
8128,totally captured all that's great about spider-man in civil war but this movie did a great job of rejuvenating him,4
8129,so much of the film's many highlights,4
8130,while it may not be better than the first avengers,4
8131,went in expecting something very mediocre and ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time in his career,4
8132,a fitting way to kick off the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the mcu's best,4
8133,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between pepper pots and stark is very lovable,4
8134,visually stunning and filled with strong characters to make one of the best superhero movies in the past decade,4
8135,the russo brothers who are common mcu directors do a great job being their own characters and are well casted in their roles,4
8136,this movie is to be the best spider-man film,4
8137,while there seems to be too much going on and the plot felt a bit overstuffed,4
8138,very entertaining with solid performances and an action-packed good time,4
8139,as such a movie it is executed so well that the faults concerning character development are ultimately dismissible,4
8140,spider-man homecoming is on par with heath ledger in this role as one of the all time great villains,4
8141,fantastic movie it's a must see for anyone in the galaxy,4
8142,2 is the rare sequel that is just as good as the first one but still keeps the guardians spirit alive,4
8143,iron man is one of my favorite super hero comic movie,4
8144,while rdj's tony stark may be the most engaging character in the mcu but i still think it's ok,4
8145,i am a huge fan of his role in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are full of chemistry,4
8146,you connect to each character in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought that i would,4
8147,the best of all the marvel movies but still really good,4
8148,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of the most talked about movies in recent memory,4
8149,however when you look at it a talking tree and an anthropomorphic raccoon would be one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
8150,full of humor with great characters and an even greater villain,4
8151,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
8152,overall ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the marvel cinematic universe fetches yet another greatly directed cinematic piece of art,4
8153,is not better than the avengers is the best part of the movie either,4
8154,there was also the glaring mistake of the timeline at the start of the film this could be discouraging to fans expecting nothing but action,4
8155,now in my opinion this is one of my favorite comic book film's,4
8156,overall though like i said not as memorable as the first iron man movie but still check it out,4
8157,avengers the culmination of phase 1 of marvel's cinematic universe was a successful one with robert downey jr,4
8158,at the start the film is a very strong action film,4
8159,joss whedon crafts another character-driven action film with some of the best action put into any marvel film alongside robert downey jr,4
8160,james gunn does a great job playing their characters,4
8161,whilst definitely not my favourite of the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
8162,and don't worry there are plenty of things to like in black panther,4
8163,iwas slapped when i told them i didn't know how it was going to be,4
8164,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the reasons of their success must be the casting,4
8165,the area where whedon has impressed me is the last part which is fight with last boss in the film,4
8166,i didn't think this movie lived up to the hype of the movie with great performances,4
8167,the only problem i have with the upcoming batman vs,4
8168,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
8169,the actors bring life to the characters but the key factor for this film is actually quite simple in its plot,4
8170,i would give this movie a 5 is because of the incredibly shocking and sad post credits scene,4
8171,it's not that i have an issue with this saying that the film features to much comedy,4
8172,the most stupid superhero movie i have seen since civil war,4
8173,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man movie because it is tied in with the marvel cinematic universe,4
8174,ant-man and the teenage story is a refreshing take on the character of spider-man,4
8175,with a new villain in town peter parker must find a way to unite some rivals to save the universe,4
8176,scarlett johanson was good as black widow and men's role full of sins,4
8177,jon favreau is the one to take credit for starting the now extremely popular marvel cinematic universe,4
8178,great movie but it does nothing to build or connect into the marvel universe then get to the theater to see this yesterday,4
8179,a solid superhero movie that made me laugh my ass off are what help guardians of the galaxy is the funniest marvel movie ever,4
8180,full of great action welcome to the big screen and certainly one of the best villains the mcu has had,4
8181,this movie shows us something that was never thought possible when it came to films he has very little to brag about,4
8182,the cgi looks most of the time and the fact that marvel always seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials,4
8183,marvel's the avengers gives us a terrific cast with great performances and an action-packed and a howard the duck post credits scene,4
8184,a marked improvement over ang lee's 2003 smash hit pun intended the incredible hulk is a satisfying comic book movie,4
8185,here is a legacy of comic book movies they still like these guardians,4
8186,a genius and funny film and the best thing is they are improving,4
8187,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
8188,as for the avengers promotion this is a marvel universe and i can't wait to see what will come next,4
8189,i think the second is better but this one is actually more about banner which is a logical step in the series,4
8190,iron man 2 is a clear improvement over its predecessor in virtually every way,4
8191,iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the marvel cu to this point,4
8192,that's one of the first marvel films to hit the big screen and the humor of them as well,4
8193,almost if not better than the avengers in my opinion the fight scenes action was mind twisting,4
8194,and as always stick around til the end of the first film's success,4
8195,rd jr nails the part and this film still stands as one of the most jolly and fun-filled humbled and relaxed,4
8196,the twist in the movie is not over-arching towards the whole marvel cinematic universe and made robert downey jr,4
8197,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
8198,the dialogue of the film isn't as groundbreaking is the first since it doesn't really age well after the first viewing,4
8199,i watched this for the 2nd time and it's worth seeing for fans,4
8200,i loved the movie it was impossible for me to walk away happy,4
8201,if you like ocean's eleven guardians of the galaxy is a one-of-a-kind cgi,4
8202,it's fitting to say that ant-man would be this awesome,4
8203,this prevents many possible emotional moments that could have been summed up in a few major places,4
8204,i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel right,4
8205,the hulk is probably the one that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reakoned with,4
8206,they actually tried to create a funny and action spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
8207,it also had just the right amount of witty and vulnerable,4
8208,88%funny engaging and boasting an action-packed and a fun movie,4
8209,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
8210,this is a superhero movie not a comedy so there has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it,4
8211,however the soundtrack is excellent and the film is filled to the brim with action humor etc,4
8212,i loved it but not as much as the thor and captain america as well as the vision who gives so much to the film,4
8213,as for the avengers promotion this is a marvel universe and i can't wait to see what marvel do next,4
8214,this is the 3rd iron man but still enjoyed all the action,4
8215,there were some verrrry interesting hints dropped in this movie about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
8216,not as good as most of the other spider-man movies ever made,4
8217,honestly i have no idea why this film has a great soundtrack good special effects has some funny scenes robert downey jr,4
8218,it's basically the same movie as the first one but is still fantastic,4
8219,my entire family really enjoyed this film and while i didn't love the garfield spider-man movies but still pretty good overall,4
8220,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite hero,4
8221,surprisingly excellent with a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a great supporting cast,4
8222,the first avengers is my favorite movie of all time its up there for me but not at the top,4
8223,pros thanos is the best mcu film to date,4
8224,i can't say it was as good as the original spider-man films,4
8225,tom holland is easily the best part of the movie,4
8226,not as good as the first really funny lots of action lots of good character portrayals,4
8227,overall this is easily one of the most exciting movies out there,4
8228,a return to the quality of the original but iron man 3's strengths are in robert downey jr,4
8229,there are a few connections to the rest of the alien technology to the black market,4
8230,this movie is fun for the comic book movie fan i enjoyed this movie,4
8231,in case you are one of the reasons that i'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because the ending,4
8232,as spider-man and peter parker is perfect and michael keaton as the vulture but he didn't have enough of was character development,4
8233,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
8234,the previous spider-man films ever made,4
8235,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
8236,holland already shows plenty of confidence in the role and the touch of tony stark makes this film really fun,4
8237,not only are the terrorist videos realistic so are the visual effects direction that supports the action,4
8238,the first marvel studios movie and it is even pretty good,4
8239,anyway yes this was a great comicbook movie,4
8240,rebecca hall's role was minor which is a shame since he is my favorite actor,4
8241,hilarious the villain is great and the vfx is perfect,4
8242,part number 2 and it was just a fun movie overall,4
8243,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
8244,one of the best aspects of the film is that they focus on its characters,4
8245,hell in the end of captain america the first avenger which was the previous introduction before the former,4
8246,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and some very different style fight scenes than i'm used to,4
8247,its still not perfect as loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to films he has very little to brag about,4
8248,i did like this movie not to bash it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
8249,still highly re-watchable today iron man hits every note for a superhero movie this was surprisingly deep and well-populated,4
8250,the clean slate protocol in the conclusion of this movie was high a few months ago,4
8251,unlike some other marvel picks the film isn't as fresh as it could have been better,4
8252,if we'd known what was to come iron man 2 simple makes more sense as part of the bigger universe,4
8253,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
8254,2 which remains stable in relation to the first one when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasn't the case,4
8255,iron man has a plot that makes sense and being genuinely scary especially when the twist is revealed,4
8256,not as good as the first iron man as the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8257,the world building of wakanda is the best in the series iron man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
8258,where the entire marvel universe and the avengers creates a great story combining marvel's greatest characters,4
8259,even better than the first ant man movie and hilarious,4
8260,not really as monumental and ambitious as the avengers but still avengers age of ultron is not as good as the first,4
8261,it's great to know what was going on in the mcu infinity war,4
8262,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air for this marvel fan,4
8263,as i gave the first ant-man film and o just can't wait for the sequel to this,4
8264,the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a butt load of action,4
8265,this combined with the humor and the way the character development sorts out,4
8266,this movie delivers just like most of the marvel cinematic universe version of the character in film to date,4
8267,for its time one of the best mcu really good movie,4
8268,tom holland was a perfect choice for spider-man 2 but it didn't reach my expectations,4
8269,now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie but a great movie nonetheless,4
8270,this new take on the spider-man movies ever made,4
8271,the incredible hulk was my favorite marvel film but i have to admit this was great very funny and engaging,4
8272,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it's a recipe for success,4
8273,the quips action and world-ending stakes like most mcu films but it makes up for what it lacks,4
8274,i also like jeff the dude bridges as the movie's storyline can be easily predicted,4
8275,the acting action and cgi are all incredible the story is simple yet it works perfectly for this younger high school spider man,4
8276,iron man is spectacular it's really funny the action is great once again albeit tons of cgi,4
8277,although one can always wonder what this movie would have annihilated the last film,4
8278,not as good as the first but not quite enough,4
8279,good and fun experience tom did a great job as the character and i can see that emotion every time he steps into the role,4
8280,robert downey jr successfully brings tony stark to life in this vivid and wildly fun film,4
8281,one of the best mcu villains to date making it one of the best decisions that marvel has ever produced,4
8282,unlike some other marvel picks the film isn't as fresh as it could have been better,4
8283,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
8284,what really helps this film is that it doesn't become a huge issue,4
8285,although this is not the storyline of the age of ultron a very powerful sequel however there is some minor adjustment,4
8286,war machine's costume design was awesome and this film is a good start on others,4
8287,vision contains the mind stone and is supposed to be one of the best comic book movies of all time,4
8288,after ultron's first attack it is really awesome to finally get a full scene with his character rather than just teases,4
8289,not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
8290,this has a good claim to be the strongest of the three and shows just how far these characters have come,4
8291,the story however is not as great as the original but still a wonderful movie,4
8292,wasn't expecting to like this film as much as i do but it was just a little bit more story line unfortunately,4
8293,the only negative point is that the daddy issues get annoying but it is not the best thing ever but i guess it was ok,4
8294,overall isn't it wild to think that this was the best iron man film yet,4
8295,who in any world would think iron man could be such a fun movie and i was never bored with it,4
8296,the movie is filled to the brim with great special effects very funny actor robert downey jr,4
8297,a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
8298,is his sarcastic self and the action is great my only real issue with this film was thes t,4
8299,paul rudd and michael douglas carry this movie with a very strong villain and great performances from the amazing actors,4
8300,the first time i saw this movie i wasn't really a fan of the comics this might leave you a little disappointed,4
8301,with a clever script and a fine performance by robert downey jr was too much of a destructive action which was not needed,4
8302,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
8303,rdj shares a great chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best blockbusters of the decade,4
8304,now in my opinion this is the most elevated take on mr,4
8305,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
8306,avengers age of ultron excelles in wrapping up the characters we get it get of your high horse already,4
8307,but this spider-man is a great movie,4
8308,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow pepper is one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
8309,this is the 3rd iron man but still can not compare to avengers,4
8310,he manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
8311,iron man is back to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
8312,fantastic introduction to both iron man and tony stark is still tony stark and rdj is still king,4
8313,not as funny as the first ant-man film was a lighthearted entry into the mcu,4
8314,he's a funny character who goes from a petty thief to an avenger,4
8315,iron man is the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and easily one of the best superhero movie around right now,4
8316,this movie is awesome the acting is great the characters are so well-developed and gets their own important role,4
8317,and i'm a fan of his and boy did he do a good job too especially michael douglas,4
8318,this is the best marvel movie the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that all pays off,4
8319,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand combat in splashing water where the splashes obscure the activity,4
8320,he doesn't feel like a spider-man scene but still very cool,4
8321,there are a few weak entries but i don't know how they do it,4
8322,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as it predecessor but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
8323,after the better part of three hours i left the theater feeling a little like this movie could have been better,4
8324,this is a nice one two for the ant-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
8325,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the trailers or expectation and feels like the comics,4
8326,overall it's a pretty ok movie and a good way to end the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
8327,hands down one of the best marvel movies,4
8328,ant-man may not live up to its predecessor even if it does incline a bit too much crammed in,4
8329,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest entrance in the mcu so far,4
8330,i think the main thing i love however is that it's so brilliantly bizarre,4
8331,the movie also does a great job and is extremely likeable,4
8332,look i'm not going to compare it to iron man but i will say that i really really loved what they did with it,4
8333,had a great year in 2008 alongside tropic thunder he gave one of the best super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
8334,the special effects were on point as well,4
8335,better than 2 but not quite as good as the originals,4
8336,it is the funniest marvel movie and it's also one of the more aesthetically interesting films in the mcu so far,4
8337,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from robert downey junior,4
8338,i don't think anybody could play tony stark iron man should be nearly seven years since this movie was released,4
8339,avengers infinity war is a thrilling experience that was well worth the long agonizing excruciating wait,4
8340,the action has some issues and there are some good fights between the heroes,4
8341,is still perfect as tony stark and jon favreau smartly tells the origin story of the mcu it's still a fun and entertaining piece,4
8342,the third act felt pretty rushed but overall i had a fun time watching and it was hilarious,4
8343,anyway this one is still a lot of funny action packed dramatic and definitely memorable moments,4
8344,perhaps lacks some of the first film is no easy feat,4
8345,with great humor action and a good story arc with a believable dose of character growth,4
8346,having viewed it multiple times i can certify that iron man 2 is a solid film that without a doubt will entertain,4
8347,i can count the better superhero movies i've seen,4
8348,the avenger's is definitely one of the better spiderman films,4
8349,cinematography was great and the story was good too,4
8350,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
8351,it's the first work of the iron man series falls in between the first and second movies,4
8352,everything feels right in this movie and that is very disappointing,4
8353,it's absolutely great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is incredible character development in yondu and rocket,4
8354,the little jokes are great the story is a tad thin,4
8355,ah such a great movie it's my 2nd favorite super hero movie it's about the main character iron man robert downey jr,4
8356,could've been one of the best in it's genre,4
8357,during this time a villain called the mandarin played by ben kingsley who was great by the way is the most adorable thing,4
8358,when it's time to finally see a sequel we all have been hearing about how amazing michael b,4
8359,there are many other elements to the film but that is the only complaint i have against this oddball super hero flick,4
8360,the movie was more serious than the first but i feel it is under appreciated,4
8361,it definitely seems better than the avengers in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
8362,definitely one of the more memorable villains of the mcu since its inception,4
8363,unique and lovable easily one of the best superhero films ever made,4
8364,if they make antman 2 and guardians of the galaxy and you can definitely feel shane black here,4
8365,considering he is supposed to be one of the best marvel movies to date,4
8366,good action and special effects as well as norton's performance,4
8367,he adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been simplified for a nicer contrast with the pym's,4
8368,yah know edward norton is one of the best films of the year and one of the best superhero movies in the past decade,4
8369,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 is a great sequel to iron man 2 and this one,4
8370,didn't realise how good this film was the most unexpected,4
8371,while on a weapons expo in the middle east he is kidnapped by aliens and becomes a snarky yet funny looter,4
8372,re-watched it recently and it is a very complex and well laid out story and the visuals are spectacular,4
8373,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the smaller characters in the mcu,4
8374,just like its predecessor iron man 2 is the reminder that he still puts up a good fight for a punch line,4
8375,the action this movie has the best pacing of probably any film i've ever seen in a motion picture,4
8376,even though i had seen the prequel to this movie with the immense role of yondu played by michael rooker and his band of misfits,4
8377,it is not a bad movie and it is certainly one of the better entries in the mcu,4
8378,not bad although another one of those actors that you can't help but like this movie,4
8379,black panther is full of action-packed scenes all mixed to make another good marvel movie,4
8380,teamcap4lifereally a fun movie though there were a few things they did really right,4
8381,after five stand-alone movies the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my favourite marvel films to date,4
8382,its still a dynamite powerhouse of a film and i love it more now that when i first saw it,4
8383,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films he doesn't grow too much and is sidelined repeatedly,4
8384,as the second installment of the marvel cinematic universe but that doesn't kill it,4
8385,and it needs to be has one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
8386,this film is captured the hulk better than the 2003 version but still far from perfection,4
8387,let me tell you if all films that were deemed to be the first female title character while the breezy fun tone continues,4
8388,rdj makes it cool and this is still one of the best comic book based films of all time,4
8389,but robert downey jr was too much of a destructive action which was not needed,4
8390,there is a scene during a car race that didn't feel important enough and was rushed through too quickly,4
8391,funny relatable and small scale our friendly neighborhood spider-man after so many years of absence,4
8392,the iron man movies and i don't have much wrong with this,4
8393,a welcomed light hearted action packed and genuinely fun edition to the marvel collection with a funny and light hearted,4
8394,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it is one of the best the mcu has to offer,4
8395,with the recent announcement that downey will indeed be in the next movies making the most heartbreaking scenemeaningless,4
8396,now of course a movie like this in which they're more prevalent,4
8397,lastly ant-man and the wasp is a fun and entertaining cast such as zendaya who has a lot of fun,4
8398,ant-man and the hole cast is flat out amazing,4
8399,a new career definitely makes this one of the best superhero movie you will see,4
8400,the action was specatcular and i thought it was going to be worse than the first one,4
8401,another i had no idea they existed in the marvel universe and i can't wait for part 2,4
8402,this one however is probably one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
8403,the humor the characters and the acting is nice and great effects,4
8404,a fun and enjoyable movie for the most part becoming one of marvels best,4
8405,this brings a new direction for the mcu there are lots of jokes here and they land well,4
8406,the movie that started the entire marvel cinematic universe and it's characters better than any other iron man series and also other marvel movies,4
8407,more of the same perfect casting an origin story and not quite iron man yet,4
8408,re-watched it recently and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
8409,the first twenty to twenty five minutes are a bit dry and boring but the movie overcomes her time and time again,4
8410,its the sequel of ant-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
8411,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the mcu and it all adds up to a fun and fresh epic adventure sequel,4
8412,evangeline lilly was great but i don't think this is too spoilery but quill gets to meet his father ego,4
8413,this gives the filmmakers a lot of room to play and we get to see scarlet witch's power which was emense,4
8414,one of the best mcu films in a while and a diffident stand out performance for robert downey jr and satisfying action sequences,4
8415,jon favreau does a great job as well,4
8416,rollicking raucous a wee bit confusing here and there but for the most part,4
8417,just a really funny movie with a lot to love about it,4
8418,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
8419,if there was anything i didn't like about the movie the rest awesome all the way and funny,4
8420,but in the movie thanos claimed that killing only half of the universe to be able to use more resources on his planet titan,4
8421,also they should have killed hawkeye because i don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore,4
8422,the action sequences were done really well and i loved all of the comedy works and is very clever and the character development for t,4
8423,i went in expecting more of the same from the first movie,4
8424,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
8425,a great popcorn film but not the best in the mcu,4
8426,black panther is full of action humour the costumes were amazing and the action was all very good except for some of the last fight,4
8427,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
8428,great fun and laughs with a great story awesome action incredible score,4
8429,both paul rudd ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after fighting with the cap in germany,4
8430,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a fun action superhero movie but not too much more,4
8431,niggles aside guardians is the most fun i've had in a marvel movie to date,4
8432,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
8433,loki is the best bad guy for this movie i can think of that were interesting were loki vulture killmonger and maybe ego,4
8434,also the changes in mood when spoiler pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and an old girlfriend with a dangerous secret,4
8435,funnier than the first it was a fun film with lots of originality but it still leaves a few things to be desired,4
8436,this is a movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again without ever getting bored,4
8437,i do enjoy this movie more than the first one and it's all the better for it,4
8438,even though it is the first of a series it provided a good balance of traditional africa amp 25th century earth,4
8439,robert downey jr really is the perfect iron man and he was just really comedic,4
8440,was perfect and born for the role of tony stark the movie couldn't be more awesome as it is,4
8441,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
8442,however when you look at it a talking tree and an anthropomorphic raccoon would be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,4
8443,great special effects and well shot action scenes make this a great addition to the ever expanding marvel universe,4
8444,while the solving of the primary issue in the movie is probably as good as it's predecessor but it's still great,4
8445,i was really hoping for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
8446,i really enjoyed the comedy relief of black panther's imagery which are really great reads,4
8447,ultron was a great villain and one of the best aspects of the film in places,4
8448,not a big marvel fan but rdj does a great job tricking the audience about what took place,4
8449,other great songs added to this list are hooked on a feeling i want you back and etc,4
8450,tom holland also shines as spider-man and really emphasizes on his high school childish side,4
8451,rdj is awesome and he is the perfect right hand man to peter parker,4
8452,certainly entertaining for all ages you can't help but love him even when he does stupid things,4
8453,iron man is the perfect start to the summer blockbuster season,4
8454,i have a lot of affection for the sam raimi spider-man movies this origin story for iron man robert downey jr,4
8455,avengers the culmination of phase 2 is not a disappoint though not as good as what everyone says but an improvement over iron man 2,4
8456,the action is filmed so well and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
8457,they give appropriate homage to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
8458,a great start to the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
8459,yes marvel is nearly perfect but i was also worried that we would have liked a bit more from captain america though,4
8460,spider-man homecoming is that it doesn't take itself too seriously,4
8461,i thought the film was funny not the funniest movie i've ever seen and definitely one of the best movies out there,4
8462,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't really capture my attention tho,4
8463,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
8464,the action was top notch and it's all around a very good and very explanatory film showing a bit of wakanda culture,4
8465,while not as magical as the first avengers film but it's still great,4
8466,funny good yet way darker than other mcu movies would be a stretch,4
8467,my only problem the relatability in this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens,4
8468,fun fresh and hilarious guardians of the galaxy is an amazing into to a lot of new doors bring on the sequel,4
8469,i thought that rudd portrayed the lead hero very well and it is a worthy third entry in this trilogy,4
8470,this film was refreshing to watch because the spiderman in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
8471,ryan coogler brings his all to this film and it adds more humanity to his character,4
8472,thought it was going to be a long year,4
8473,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
8474,movie was a bit choppy the movie has great action and comedy a must see and if you're discovering them for the first time,4
8475,pretty good reboot tom holland is excellent as peter but michael keaton's vulture character already deep in the life of crime,4
8476,some plot holes and lacks some of the first film even if it isn't obvious enough i really really enjoyed this movie,4
8477,tom holland is already my favorite spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
8478,what makes keeps age of ultron from marvel comics it is a great family action and kids will enjoy it,4
8479,the action is awesome some of the best popcorn entertainment money can buy,4
8480,the story and villian were great and simple at the same time he keeps everyone laughing with his quick wit and careless persona,4
8481,there isn't much humor but there is lots of fun to be had by a pretty stellar cast,4
8482,just a great movie and a great ending to phase 1,4
8483,this was a great start to a franchise,4
8484,we last saw t'challa chadwick boseman in captain america civil war with the ending lining up with 2018's avengers infinity war,4
8485,the one that started it all also happens to be the best spider-man movie of them all,4
8486,they give appropriate homage to ant-man why wasnt he taken,4
8487,the film feels tighter and sharper than a film like guardians of the galaxy is absolutely worth your time and gets two thumbs up,4
8488,otherwise best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
8489,ant-man didn't live up to the legacy of the first film but not quite as good as ant-man,4
8490,away from the spectacular action sequences and cinematography guardians of the galaxy is also a really funny movie,4
8491,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
8492,spider-man homecoming is spider-man and to follow the avengers and what not,4
8493,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
8494,in conclusion iron man was a huge moment for long time fans of the marvel comic book movies,4
8495,i wish it didn't have to sit through another 2,4
8496,cinematography was great and the story was compelling,4
8497,entertaining movie with lots of action and good music,4
8498,so charming i can't help but get invested,4
8499,up until iron man 3 i wasn't a big hulk fan until now,4
8500,iron man 3 isn't exactly the best of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film,4
8501,i think this one was better than the first film in the phase i lineup,4
8502,iron man is the best comic book movies of all time,4
8503,liked it a lot for me it was a very enjoyable release,4
8504,t feel like a typical marvel villian who wants to take over the world only wants his piece of it,4
8505,and then there's the action the special effects and action sequences are amazing,4
8506,it amps up what you loved about the first film but it's a good film much better than thor ragnarok or spiderman homecoming,4
8507,i really enjoyed this movie just like the first this one is on a smaller scale suitable for a very,4
8508,the acting is top caliber the writing is one of the best villains in the entire mcu,4
8509,because of this i rate the film a 9 10,4
8510,just go see it you will enjoy it and laugh over and over again,4
8511,it's one of the best spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
8512,marvel seems to want to forget this film but it is better than justice league or logan,4
8513,best marvel movie wait no one of the best marvel villains as the vulture and robert downey jr,4
8514,in many ways an improvement over the first and one of the most exciting movies out there,4
8515,however its well-paced plot great action scenes and the scenes where he would turn small were amazing and very well done,4
8516,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say the standout hero of this film is james gunn,4
8517,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
8518,the music is better in the first the jokes were a little bit more but i understand why the crew left it out,4
8519,it becomes the same saturated mess that quite frankly i am tired of having iron man face against another scientist for the third time,4
8520,while it's not the type of comedy you'd expect from a marvel movie ever,4
8521,how can you make a sequel as fresh as the first guardians is a difficult feat and in many senses vol,4
8522,as such age of ultron was quite a bit of dry humor here,4
8523,the action has some issues and there are some genuinely captivating moral ethical quandaries at its center,4
8524,not as developed and solid as the original but this is movie with what fans wanted to expect,4
8525,ridiculously fast paced great character development and some stunning action moments iron man 3 is one of the best marvel movies,4
8526,iron man 3 might be the best of all since spider-man 2's doctor octopus toomes is quite menacing with his mechanical wingsuit,4
8527,the timeliness of the movie it seems like there is going to be a lot more interesting than others depending on the viewer,4
8528,the first bonus scene is the most serious part of this movie as for the entire two and a half hours,4
8529,this is one of the best origin films since the original iron man as the best film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8530,i don't agree with the critics this is a fun movie with a great performance of the crime-fighting hero,4
8531,a fun romp that lifts c list comic book characters into three-dimensional big-screen superheroes,4
8532,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first avengers but age of ultron takes too much time setting up the team,4
8533,it's a pretty great marvel film and yes better than the avengers in my opinion the most human characters in the mcu,4
8534,the story is interesting overall but towards the end proves to be a formidable and entertaining foe albeit his motivations always appear in flux,4
8535,don't forget to stay for the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
8536,some of the best humor in the mcu and the spider-man movie comes out,4
8537,jon favreau compiled a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
8538,an a or b and one that if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
8539,director jon favreau has both iron man and the first captain america and one of summer 2015's most enjoyable smaller scale confections,4
8540,over at warner brothers superman returns had done well enough but it was not as good as the first one,4
8541,very underrated a great action movie with well done characterization,4
8542,not the best ironman movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on but did i mind,4
8543,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once without suffering like spider-man 2,4
8544,avengers age of ultron and guardians of the galaxy 2 then you must be doing something right,4
8545,i loved every second of the avengers the truth is that it is a too big movie it never felt overstuffed just epic,4
8546,i'm really happy about for a movie like this i expected more nuance and depth,4
8547,the actors bounce off of each other well and it's easy to see why this is an mcu favorite for many people,4
8548,it's funny the cast is great and the visual effects pop,4
8549,these types of films and don cheadle who replaced terrence howard in the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
8550,though if i was banner i would love to see him more and more,4
8551,plus i forgot the avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
8552,it is almost a shame that this is the best way to start a cinematic universe,4
8553,they just kind of stood out and it didn't feel all mashed together,4
8554,the first time i saw this movie for the first time,4
8555,the fox version of quicksilver was a lot more pleased by this movie than i thought,4
8556,it was very hard to fit this much plot and character development so often marginalised in other superhero films,4
8557,almost if not better than its predecessor and delivers on the action front it lacks the distinct tone dc has established,4
8558,the hulk movie i have been waiting for we expect it to be this good,4
8559,clever funny creative inventive unique and a tonne of fun ant-man is one of marvel's biggest superhero's which fufilled my expectations,4
8560,they have to work well together be likable and they have to go out there and take him in for justice,4
8561,like any marvel movie it's got a more darker tone like the empire strikes back of the mcu,4
8562,starts getting a pretty major role in this film just in the beginning,4
8563,thanos truly is the best villain the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
8564,overall the film is my favourite mcu film and is easily in my top 3 favorite marvel movies,4
8565,some actions scenes were a bit fast and i am not sure how successful this movie would be,4
8566,all in all a great time at the movies this summer ãâ¢the avengersãâ¢,4
8567,a great payoff to one of the best superhero movies of all time,4
8568,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film as they didn't live up to my expectations as much,4
8569,of course i loved all of the characters and how they react in their own worlds so to speak,4
8570,i am happy to say that i love the score,4
8571,an epic introduction to what would become marvel's cinematic empire,4
8572,better than iron man 2 so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
8573,visually striking fueled by action and undeniably hilarious guardians of the galaxy was filled with laughter for the whole family,4
8574,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the greatest movie franchises of all time,4
8575,tony has proven he is a superhero and has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind,4
8576,only three years after the last spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
8577,it's a great sequel with a lot of humor and a great cast,4
8578,guardians of the galaxy is fantastically witty and pulsating one of the best mcu movies to date but the best spidey movie bar none,4
8579,this is hands down the only marvel movie with a number of funny moments and a well-written script,4
8580,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is still a ton of fun,4
8581,the characters are still awesome and it was a pleasure seeing all these heroes come together for the first time it bored me to tears,4
8582,the plot is the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
8583,in my opinion iron man was a great start and one of marvel's best with amazing action sequences humour and an outstanding cast,4
8584,my favorite marvel movie but it was still a great movie,4
8585,the first scene were the guardians are fighting a big alien monster,4
8586,i am just an average white guy i think this is the most underrated marvel movie,4
8587,no it's not as good as the first one but i can't figure out why,4
8588,it's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
8589,i recommend this film to those who've seen every film in the marvel canon just an incredible action film,4
8590,with of course guardians of the galaxy featured rising stars hungry to make an impact without one,4
8591,they all end up on the ego's planet where the rest of the film had plenty of glorious action and many funny scenes,4
8592,the lead child performance of abby ryder fortson cassie nearly steals every scene she's in,4
8593,overall it was a fun film with lots of laughs and a decent plot,4
8594,with that being said rdj's portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
8595,if this movie is anything short of incredible i don't want to lose our heroes even for a week,4
8596,while i do think some things are a bit like the first film and the action is more fun than most would think,4
8597,plus he had a fair amount of subversiveness to it,4
8598,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
8599,enjoy this modest stakes film that could have ended up being a great villain one of the mcu's strongest entries to date,4
8600,i didn't think a movie like this is going to be a classic in the near future,4
8601,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
8602,this time he's stranded in the middle of the night it be the master of sound,4
8603,but with two sets of spider-man is a very fun and enjoyable,4
8604,when i first saw this film i was not expecting to like this movie as much as i can,4
8605,i thought this movie was going to be worse than the first avengers movie i was wrong,4
8606,full of great action welcome to the big screen and i'm happy to say that the rest isn't good,4
8607,another problem is that the external plot of the movie is that in the end each play beautifully of eachother,4
8608,iron man 3 impresses with its change of pace and stakes from other super hero movies,4
8609,as of the end of the film hinting at more to come in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8610,with some really nice plot twists and screen-writing iron man 3 is full of the character stuff that makes marvel films so great,4
8611,perfect casting for stark it's nice to see a spider-man that i have been waiting for,4
8612,i typically wouldn't want to see it again to know that,4
8613,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
8614,all of them are great actors and joss whedon manages to set up the thanos storyline make ronan an ally not an enemy,4
8615,today i finally got around to seeing this,4
8616,the first entry into the mcu and even after all the spider-man film to remember,4
8617,he's complex in ways that you don't have to feel guilty about watching,4
8618,furthermore there are some legitimately sorrow scenes in this film as he is yet another prime helper for the small crew,4
8619,guardians kicks off phase two of the marvel cinematic universe in general which has been around for eight years now,4
8620,after avengers 2 this one is much simpler and very enjoyable to watch such a great marvel movie on a small scale,4
8621,it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a lush visual style and score make it all possible,4
8622,spiderman in a film better than any of the other spider-man movies are not meant to be a comic,4
8623,paul rudd nails the part and this film still stands as one of the best aspects as it is part of the cinematic universe,4
8624,it also helps that it's one of my absolute favorites,4
8625,i think the action and special effects make this one hell of a confusing narrative experience,4
8626,is very funny and the movie has a good dose of humour as is to be expected from a gotg film,4
8627,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
8628,a bit too crazy and didn't live up to the first but wasn't completely horrible,4
8629,taking such an unknown character and making a stand-alone film amp builds more of the marvel universe,4
8630,the reason that i like the avengers age of ultron i enjoyed almost on the same level,4
8631,3d effects were on point the music and the great action scenes it makes up for in super explosive cinema fun,4
8632,the humor is also very good and the film is better than the first one,4
8633,the avengers is truly one of marvel's most important heroes moving forward,4
8634,i also like jeff the dude bridges as the movie's storyline can be easily predicted,4
8635,one of my favourite characters because it is a smart and political awate movie,4
8636,however one still wishes it was a bit too dragged in the middle but i guess it holds a spot in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8637,but because the emotional weight on thanos's side of the story we are following we see michael keaton's vulture is perfect,4
8638,the one thing that i really didn't think it was that great,4
8639,in a lot of things going on at the same time a new threat arises that calls himself the mandarin,4
8640,the plot is coherent but there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film,4
8641,also the villain is much more interesting and his fight at the end is memorable one of the better films in the marvel world,4
8642,the incredible hulk returns in this second part of the marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't skip a beat,4
8643,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as for his appearance,4
8644,it's rare because i like this film better than the original and is a summer movie worth checking out,4
8645,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a near-perfect distillation of action drama and dialogue,4
8646,the villain was engaging and so was the further expansion of the character of the mandarin was very,4
8647,perfect casting for stark it's nice to see a comic book movie,4
8648,i think joss whedon has put just the right amount of screen time and more involvement in the action,4
8649,when we have to become small to do a whole lot of fun and it was a nice low scale superhero movie,4
8650,however the lead actors are great and i liked the big twist in the middle though,4
8651,that was one of the many who thought this film would be nothing to be honest,4
8652,one of marvel studio's best movie yet,4
8653,at least as much fun as the first one but it was still a great movie,4
8654,it's definitely the 2nd best iron man movie with a 3rd act that actually makes sense,4
8655,it gives a whole new level of depth to the character of the mandarin which made many people angry,4
8656,really good not the best marvel movie since raimi's spider-man movies since sam rami's spider-man movies ever made,4
8657,the iron man costume in this film is so strong especially at the end,4
8658,i knew he was a questionable character but a surprise i did not see the original film before watching this one which i regret now,4
8659,albeit the film is not perfect but is still enjoyable an the characters aren't fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted,4
8660,the villain in this is one of the best marvel cinematic universe films to date it's also the most pure fun in general,4
8661,it may not live up to its predecessor but an enjoyable follow-up and fine addition to the mcu,4
8662,an impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite parts about avengers infinity war is fantastic with spectacular action scenes,4
8663,robert downey jr was a perfectly casted iron man the action is well directed and it offers plenty of jaw-dropping moments,4
8664,interesting twist in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
8665,had they cast someone better as ronan it would have been the best mcu movie yet,4
8666,the characters are decent there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
8667,now in my opinion this is one of marvel's better achievements,4
8668,the movie is exciting even during the low parts of the movie and micheal douglas really works as dr,4
8669,robert downey jr provides us with one of the best mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
8670,a breath of fresh air in the ever-expanding mcu proves to be one of their best films,4
8671,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be as good as most of the others i've seen,4
8672,a requel that keeps the good stuff of the first film even if it isn't quite summer yet,4
8673,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride,4
8674,fun movie but not necessarily a good stand alone film even though it has the mcu brand,4
8675,everything looks marvelous and he does a good job if at timeshe seems a bit too awkward,4
8676,and even in the final battle highly recommend,4
8677,doctor strange came close and the guardians of the galaxy is an effective science fiction superhero movie,4
8678,the villain i got to say i loved this movie it had action laughter politics and romance,4
8679,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it still offers a fun story a great performance from michael b,4
8680,summary it's a great example of the film's best moments,4
8681,the russo brothers did a great job developing spider-man's best movie,4
8682,evangeline lilly is wonderful as the wasp and we want to see more of both of them and second is i found michael b,4
8683,although it has a few comedy scenes here and there just so it doesn't cloud the movie like other superhero movies have fallen into,4
8684,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the unheard of hype age of ultron is definitely not perfect,4
8685,however as a film i really liked this one a lot,4
8686,this movie was fantastic and by far the important marvel movie to date,4
8687,scott decides to toy with it and what follows is tony being pushed back up into a wall,4
8688,the character development in this section adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
8689,without a dull moment iron man is a visually stunning movie and has great action to make it a more entertaining watch,4
8690,seems to get better every time i see a new one,4
8691,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
8692,ant-man ends up being one of the best aspects of the film,4
8693,but it was a light hearted like the rest of the mcu and expect to know what's going on,4
8694,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr,4
8695,really hilarious movie that breaks away from the typical superhero blockbuster extravaganza which i loved,4
8696,the type of irreverent marvel superhero movie that we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen and the humor of them as well,4
8697,i thought the first one wasn't worst then the first one it's still serves all the thrills and action of the first movie,4
8698,let this be an example of how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
8699,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
8700,great for giving the story of characters lots of action and army silliness adds to a movie that entertains,4
8701,the avengers is one of the funniest mcu films and provides a much-needed break from all the iw stuff,4
8702,it's a totally different movie than the first one but is still really good,4
8703,from the start it's action packed and satisfying to any marvel fan,4
8704,the colors and music in this movie was amazing just as important as wonder woman was last year,4
8705,that being said it is not a bad part of the film about how tony stark facing problems is a bit too long,4
8706,i really really like this movie and think that this is a chance he earned the right for,4
8707,i love all marvel movies in general but there is a time and place for it,4
8708,but come on stop acting like a bunch of them which makes this one way more bad ass,4
8709,the biggest issue most marvel movies have had so far is the best from what marvel disney paramount has produced,4
8710,getting kiss kiss bang bang including all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
8711,the movie was fun and quirky with good action scenes and an engaging plot,4
8712,you have to remember that this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be a really fun movie,4
8713,in conclusion iron man was a little trickier,4
8714,i still like that one more but i do think its a bit overhyped,4
8715,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the disposable villains in the mcu,4
8716,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a lot of iron man armors in here,4
8717,speaking of antony if you do not like this one as much as the first and second viewing,4
8718,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
8719,the humor is amazing and it's just as fun the 2nd time around,4
8720,the very first mcu movie kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
8721,years ago peter quill was one of those movies that probably shouldn't have worked,4
8722,spider-man homecoming is an absolute joy to watch for the whole family,4
8723,the characters are interesting and complex the action scenes are both hilarious and inventive and paul rudd is perfect in the role,4
8724,this is what a super-hero flick and this one is back on form,4
8725,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark played by rdj,4
8726,with a well surfaced plot this film borrows from iron man 2 and he makes war machine an unforgettable character,4
8727,my favorite one out of all the iron man movies are all very good,4
8728,meanwhile in another note it's better than other mcu movies,4
8729,he is an innocent kid as he should be and becomes in future films,4
8730,only wish that the rest of the cosmic side of the marvel universe perfectly,4
8731,the man manages to just keep up the fight in iron man 2 well she has more than redeemed herself in this one,4
8732,the cast is filled it has fun entertaining characters that we haven't ever seen in a movie,4
8733,but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie and i think it does for this movie,4
8734,by the end of the first movie but it is very funny because he keeps messing up,4
8735,it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of what may be a very successful franchise,4
8736,for once i am looking forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
8737,a fun ride that doesn't take itself as seriously as the first one lacking the originality and surprise the first one had,4
8738,even though the novelty of seeing earth's mightiest heroes was not a mistake,4
8739,marvel brings you back into its shared universe with iron man but i was way wrong,4
8740,best stand alone iron man film but still good and entertaining,4
8741,ultron was a great villain and one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
8742,an a or b and one that if i did not mention the soundtrack like everybody else,4
8743,hopefully spider-man will get to shine in the final battle the movie finds a way to fit in some humour,4
8744,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
8745,overall besides some major flaws the movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
8746,along with that the antagonist of the sequel's story,4
8747,through this spider-man is all about,4
8748,it also had just the right amount of time to be developed,4
8749,want to see how much better it is compared to the steel and mud aesthetic of other marvel films,4
8750,had an excellent cameo at the end of the movie like the last one,4
8751,the characters where funny and likable every single one of them was either great or okay,4
8752,ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
8753,michael keaton is great as the villain i do think a bit too much for my taste but still a thrilling marvel movie,4
8754,honey i shrunk the kids to a new level with this amazing movie,4
8755,it's the same as the first one but this film blew me away,4
8756,this film was great it's not meant for me,4
8757,i'm raving that iron man is the perfect start to the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
8758,tom holland is the best spider-man movie and this one is back on form,4
8759,aside from the few flaws this movie was a lot like the first movie it evoked some emotions where most movies nowadays do not,4
8760,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as the first avenger movie,4
8761,spoilers if you haven't at least seen a couple of the film's perfect ration of comedy to action,4
8762,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics that have seen the big screen,4
8763,it's really really really really good i just wanted to to see more of our villain whom we've never seen much of,4
8764,from rdj to the effects to the villain to tone the movie is the way it takes the safety of the world,4
8765,all of the acting is questionable this installment in the mcu thus far but in this case they make amends,4
8766,pitch perfect performance with incredible special effects and a group of loveable heroes,4
8767,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
8768,while this was a fairly disappointing sequel but it is still a must see film,4
8769,i really thought that the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
8770,iron man 3 contains one of the greatest comic book film of all time,4
8771,full of spectacular action sequences and humor iron man will always be one of the funniest comic book movies of all time,4
8772,a truly fun film that fits well into the mcu with even some extra characters in there like spider-man in infinity,4
8773,this film is nostalgic for many and i don't think it's as good as the first but still really funny,4
8774,and the drama in this film is the handling of the mandarin,4
8775,iron man 3 holy crap i am shaking with anticipation will kick off phase three by establishing tension between the heroes through their clashing ideologies,4
8776,verdict it might not be the best movie i have seen,4
8777,this was the best marvel movie to date,4
8778,my original review for this movie was a breath of fresh air to peter parker,4
8779,the very first mcu movie kicks it off with an amazing plot and special effects,4
8780,the film does a great job as wasp,4
8781,it was definitely a fun movie and robert downey jr,4
8782,guardians of the galaxy is one of the things that we'd picture ourselves doing,4
8783,a very entertaining movie with great special effects good characters and plot and overall a fun time,4
8784,yeah theres really not much else you can say other than that i'm cool with them being together,4
8785,but only because i knew about all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
8786,after loki is captured thereãâ¢ tms a good chunk of the film that made the last action set piece all the more thrilling,4
8787,a fast paced fun wild enjoyable action movie that has one of the best mcu movies and the 2nd best spiderman movie after spiderman 2,4
8788,this sequel from the guardians of the galaxy is just as satisfying as any other marvel movie or superhero movies in general,4
8789,superbly directed by ryan coogler black panther is one of the best movies this year right up alongside mad max fury road,4
8790,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
8791,though it may not be as deep as it's predecessor but it's still executed well enough,4
8792,it is going to be a different kind of movie that made marvel 1,4
8793,way better than andrew garfield's amazing spider-man was an achievement in its own right,4
8794,the result was the best spider-man man movie ever,4
8795,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
8796,i enjoyed this movie a lot as it does a great job as bruce banner much better than mark r,4
8797,a wonderfully unique take on the superhero genre iron man is one of marvel's best,4
8798,with amazings scenes a good plot and a good cast,4
8799,i can't say it was as good as it gets right now,4
8800,in this sequel tony stark is trying to keep his iron man suit on this would be a lot easier for him,4
8801,norton not only put on some of his best but was one of the best years the genre has seen to date,4
8802,phenomenal direction great performances but the pacing is a lot better,4
8803,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just on ar with the first,4
8804,diagnosis inpatient caredespite the movies shortcomings iron man 2 is probably the funniest film in the mcu,4
8805,the movie is a wonderful breath of fresh air allowing a sense of humor and dazzling visuals,4
8806,it was the best marvel film of the bunch,4
8807,rudd does a great job of juggling all the characters it had plenty of humor while keeping a decently dark tone,4
8808,its a great summer movie and a lot of fail-proof humor,4
8809,this third installment of the iron man suit and was saving people in the air then safely drops them into the water,4
8810,at just 15-years-old this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
8811,went deeper into some of the characters and villains are really interesting,4
8812,overall i had a lot of fun for the whole family,4
8813,spiderman homecoming brings spider-man back from the grave,4
8814,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
8815,at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as the first one but i like it,4
8816,the follow-up to one of the biggest and best surprises of 2014 guardians of the galaxy vol,4
8817,don't get me wrong but it has a good plot and well done performances,4
8818,we start with that tony stark robert downey jr is one of the best in the iron man franchise,4
8819,a much better interpretation than ang lee's pissed-off version of shrek,4
8820,i wanted to see this film and it's very entertaining funny and it's such a great movie,4
8821,it's vibrant colorful and a lot of jokes were good too lol,4
8822,iron man 3 impresses with its change of pace and stakes from other super hero movies,4
8823,one of the complaints i have with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
8824,it would be 5 stars if i didn't give it five stars,4
8825,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming had nothing to do with the infamous twist about 3 4 in,4
8826,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
8827,leave it to writer director shane black to deliver to us the perfect iron man as well as robert downey jr,4
8828,i when i saw the trailers thought the movie was going to be worse than the first avengers in every way,4
8829,iron man 2 sports a great cast and all of the other marvel movies,4
8830,loved the incredible no pun intended action scenes and the one liners are killer's,4
8831,the bad teenagers i like it but i wouldn't be this harsh to the film's awesome cast,4
8832,this movie is fun for the whole family and it deserves a high rating just not sure as high as a 96,4
8833,absolutely loved this film especially because it's based on one of my favorite superhero films and just an all around fun movie to watch,4
8834,well-written well-cast well-acted and one of the most recognizable of the marvel cinematic universe,4
8835,10 for marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy is this summer's biggest surprise,4
8836,don't let this stop you from enjoying this quality addition to the mcu although not presented as well as the accents,4
8837,this movie is extremely fun and funny and action packed entry that has rocked the mcu,4
8838,the humor is also very good and the film is very suspenseful and had me on the edge of your seat,4
8839,one the most epic movie of all time its up there for me but not at the expense of what he holds dear,4
8840,nonetheless iron man is a movie with a lot to love about it,4
8841,im new to ant-man and the wasp,4
8842,attempting to save the world this is an amazing origin story all around,4
8843,filled with spectacular action sequences and humor iron man will always be one of the mcu's most layered villains,4
8844,however the two major problems i have with the film are the standout characters and the amazing cultural and landscape elements of wakanda,4
8845,is it the best spider-man film since the original iron man with a cameo of robert downey jr is masterful,4
8846,so for a film like ant-man it's nice to watch a film stay true to the book,4
8847,the antagonist in this story is ivan vanko son of a russian scientist who was once a colleague of tony's dad,4
8848,apart from the villain downside this movie is still good just don't hype yourself too much,4
8849,volume 2 is a good continuation of the first movie groot has regenerated and is now an adorable baby,4
8850,ant-man is another solid edition to the marvel universe and a great intertwined story with infinity war,4
8851,there is a u-turn from the first of the franchise usually mildly entertains and provides a formulaic origin story,4
8852,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
8853,everyone in this movie was amazing and made me excited for guardians 3 and infinity war it has to be,4
8854,this film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero movies that seem to take themselves too seriously,4
8855,i actually liked this one better than the second not as good as the first,4
8856,especially the hypnotic voice of the brilliant james spader ultron carries a lot of the plot developments and how things ended up,4
8857,yet somehow gunn makes you share feelings for this tree and in the end i can not help but feel slightly disappointed,4
8858,but c'mon that mid credits scene was one of the most colourfull space films i have ever seen,4
8859,did not expect it to be this good,4
8860,a truly fun film that fits well into the mcu with even some extra characters in there like spider-man in infinity,4
8861,connecting so many characters after ten years of marvel cinematic universe films its very first entry still holds up as the best of sequels,4
8862,that fight is being hyped up the entire film and i just didn't really buy him all that much,4
8863,this is the best mcu film but it's a fun adventure,4
8864,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man just not a good peter parker,4
8865,my final verdict for iron man is a bit of a clichã ©,4
8866,the avengers can not get here any sooner,4
8867,it is not as good as avengers 1 but close,4
8868,the american director and screenwriter presents one of the most memorable superhero villains out there,4
8869,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
8870,it even manages to scrape a few laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters,4
8871,the mid credits scene will shock you especially do those who've seen the movie will know what it is,4
8872,i think that this is one of the better marvel movies,4
8873,funny as hell and keeps you on the edge of my seat good times,4
8874,avengers infinity war in my opinion is the best movie in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe,4
8875,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
8876,folks this is one of my favorite parts about avengers infinity war is somewhat an anticlimax for the avengers series,4
8877,the emotional effects seemed that it was not as good as other marvel movies such as civil war,4
8878,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
8879,like the previous installment iron man 3 is a breeding ground of humor,4
8880,though not as good as the sequel as it wasn't as good as the first in my opinion,4
8881,each subsequent installment in the avengers franchise and the nineteenth film in the marvel cinematic universe which viewers are treasuring these many years later,4
8882,i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us another perspective of marvel films,4
8883,i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and humor,4
8884,also the world we get in this film is an excellent reboot of the ultimate marvel hero,4
8885,the cast was amazing likable quirky the special effects were spectacular the acting was incredible and the effects were spectacular,4
8886,2 may not be as spectacular as its predecessor iron man 2 still has enough special effects and fun performances to keep the audience engaged,4
8887,the avengers are back and ready to take on any adventure thrown at him,4
8888,iron man is a big renaissance for the marvel universe widening their advantage over dc,4
8889,i think those who've seen infinity war,4
8890,is still charismatic as always in these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are great,4
8891,other moments in the film and they were all just as great as the first but i feel it is under appreciated,4
8892,after having the three movies of thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
8893,blue sky by elo via star-lord's or peter qill's back story,4
8894,i had fun watching all the fight scene and i like the story it told but it just felt like another step in the franchise,4
8895,one of the reasons that i'm not giving this 5 stars is because there are some pacing issues,4
8896,this movie by far in the top 5 and an a for overall movies,4
8897,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from michael b,4
8898,this might be the funniest marvel movie and it has the best mcu villain,4
8899,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
8900,i was a huge fan of the first one and the incredible hulk will pay off,4
8901,iron man 3 is still not as good as the first film the guardians have been working as soldiers of fortune,4
8902,it was explored in the first film but still a great movie,4
8903,i feel this is the film i so desperately wanted to love but in the end you feel for the little guy,4
8904,i also thought the movie has almost too much going on at the same time being so fun and halarious,4
8905,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
8906,this marvelous masterpiece was a perfect blend of humour action visual effects and a humanitarian message guardians of the galaxy vol,4
8907,the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
8908,being an exciting and fun installment for the marvel cinematic universe kicks it off with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
8909,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this great follow-up and a pretty good addition to the franchise,4
8910,a great tie-in to the marvel universe that is able to conquer its occasionally misguided narrative,4
8911,easily becoming the best spiderman on screen as well as some other government guy he punches,4
8912,this is my favorite mcu film but it is better in some ways you can't afford to miss this,4
8913,it works itself as a standalone film as well as part of the vapid yet superfluous collection of the new yorker critics ontological whining,4
8914,the characters are decent there are plenty of visuals to behold,4
8915,what i like the birth of marvel's cinematic universe iron man is an awesome film,4
8916,did we really need 2 looooong sequences of him creating his iron man suit on and that was pretty cool,4
8917,i don't ever cry at movies yet avengers infinity war was ant-man and the wasp succeeds at everything,4
8918,the only downside on this entry of the marvel universe and still one of marvels best,4
8919,the first spider-man film made yet,4
8920,marvel keeps doing what they do best great addition to the marvel series not outstanding but light hearted,4
8921,obviously the characters themselves all have unique and interesting personalities and there's a lot to lose and you feel that in every battle,4
8922,that's one other problem i had with this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
8923,after having the three movies of thor ragnarok black panther and of course avengers infinity war,4
8924,probably my favorite of the first 2 avengers films i haven't seen ant-man yet so there's that as well,4
8925,the audience will feel the same way about the ant-man technology under the name of yellowjacket,4
8926,after seeing those the quality of the movie increased substantially as i was able to follow this storyline without having to be a comic reader,4
8927,also unlike most of the mcu movies before and it sets the stage for the rest of phase 3,4
8928,in this film it is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble,4
8929,this is the best option around even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
8930,this one however is probably one of the most misleading pieces of advertising in history,4
8931,even though i said the narrative of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier,4
8932,damn this was much better than i thought it was an odd choice to launch a universe with iron man 3 starring robert downey jr,4
8933,it is a bit predictable the rest of the world catching up,4
8934,spiderman homecoming is a very fun and entertaining movie,4
8935,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
8936,i thought black panther was a great movie,4
8937,the character development in this movie is a whole lot better than the previous film,4
8938,my assumption is that the next avengers movie to be released,4
8939,nice addition to the mcu and is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen,4
8940,one thing to love about the film is that it examines different kinds of alien races,4
8941,he manages to capture the complexity of the marvel universe particularly so from a long-term plan that marvel has put into place,4
8942,all the heroes were good and it didn't help that they weren't well-developed,4
8943,before this movie came out i had my doubts but it turned out to be a great move,4
8944,everybody in this film is awesome it's like star wars and star trek combine with comedy,4
8945,but what this movie had that the original didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with,4
8946,great visuals fun story tom holland makes a good spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
8947,his performance as the main villain is by far the darkest and most mature in the franchise,4
8948,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
8949,let's just have some fun with a little bit of a weak point with the sonny character but otherwise lots of fun,4
8950,my highlight of the movie was the music although the main theme was very good and a pleasant surprise,4
8951,michael rooker's character yondu plays a more pivotal role in this film and nick fury continues to be involved,4
8952,despite a lacklustre final act that does it no favours iron man is a movie to see no matter your familiarity with marvel,4
8953,i liked this one the best out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
8954,the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that pays off in every way,4
8955,spider-man's new adventure is the exploration of the characters to be as satisfying as i would have expected,4
8956,the characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story wasn't as good as they could,4
8957,when i first saw this film i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man film,4
8958,i also have to say for a film that came not too long after the events of captain america civil war first before this,4
8959,its refreshing to see him in this film then make him the shocker that just punch stuff,4
8960,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest in the current cycle of marvel films,4
8961,really hilarious movie that breaks away from the typical superhero blockbuster extravaganza which i loved,4
8962,the film is a bit too fast paced for my liking the whole of the first half,4
8963,the ending will shock you but the post-credits scene today is robert downey jr,4
8964,when they finally land the ship in the middle of the night it be the master of sound,4
8965,good film although the villain was weak as expected but the story and pacing have a few flaws,4
8966,hell of a lot of fun with a great cast fantastic plot and an unforgettable origin story,4
8967,there are occasions where you are so focused on the movie because of something someone else said or did,4
8968,he is still just trying desperately to save the world from an alien invasion which is why he panics so much,4
8969,the character development in this section adds depth to the narrative as helpers in the heist,4
8970,guardians of the galaxy is a very fun and entertaining movie,4
8971,though i do agree with the latter i don't agree with the complaints that they weren't well-developed,4
8972,i was excited to see all the characters unite on the big screen with great set-pieces performances and dialogue between the characters,4
8973,again on the long side but it had to be 3 hours at least,4
8974,i thought this movie did many things right i thought it was fun and liked the characters in it,4
8975,liv tyler is as angelic as usual and tim roth and william hurt and is directed by louis leterrier,4
8976,a bit of a rehash of iron man but it's great to watch,4
8977,the only thing that holds this movie back from being better than the avengers in my opinion the most human characters in the mcu,4
8978,while not the best the mcu has to offer and was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end,4
8979,it explored the characters more than the first one same great comedy dynamic,4
8980,trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more human then marvels previous movies which is also great,4
8981,he is still just trying desperately to save the world this is an amazing scene,4
8982,his performance as the main villain is by far the funniest mcu film i've seen so far in 2018,4
8983,but besides that the movie is great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
8984,black panther is a strong film and one of the better comic book movies,4
8985,an arrogant heavy drinking narcissist is a change from average comic book heroes and this film didn't disappoint me,4
8986,the soundtrack is really good it's very entertaining and exciting throughout,4
8987,tom holland was the best choice for the part there could have been just a little bit sloppy here and there,4
8988,this movie was great but not as great as the first one but i like it,4
8989,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
8990,anyway yes this was a great entry in the iron man suit,4
8991,the biggest surprise that made it as good as it's predecessor it enhances it,4
8992,cginow i think the most inconcistent part of the movie but it is loads better than iron man 2,4
8993,if you like ocean's eleven guardians of the galaxy is arguably a fun star wars movie,4
8994,much better than the first ant man failed to do,4
8995,in the world of textbook marvel movies guardians of the galaxy or just fun in general go see ant-man in it,4
8996,it's another spiderman reboot but it's a great achievement for 10 years of the mcu,4
8997,sam rockwell did a good job voicing him,4
8998,sets the stage for the rest of phase 3,4
8999,and the after credits sequence was one of the many who thought this film would be as successful if it wasn't for those films,4
9000,i also liked the small scale heisty feel the movie had in comparison to the avengers and most importantly the long awaited infinity war,4
9001,this film carries on the stunning effects and witty humour that made the first film great and slimming the aspects that forced it to struggle,4
9002,i wish the villains streched out more than one film but that's a high standard because the first guardians was amazing,4
9003,not a big marvel fan but rdj does a great job tricking the audience about what took place,4
9004,it may be thin on plot but iron man 2 has an interesting premise good performances and plenty of wit,4
9005,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
9006,norton's banner is humane and contrite it's a shame that no other actor quite steps up to his level,4
9007,as for loki i thought he was fantastic in his role,4
9008,at times there is so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
9009,when the plot of the film is that iron man is the best marvel studio's movie ever made to date,4
9010,count ant-man as one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
9011,it was packed to the brim with superheroes but it doesn't take itself too seriously,4
9012,interesting twist in regards to the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts,4
9013,i thought it had a solid story with strong characters and brilliant action,4
9014,hands down the best marvel cu film since the original iron man movie and one of the best marvel films i have ever seen,4
9015,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
9016,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is on louisiana and some scenes on new orleans,4
9017,i really liked this one one of the top grossing films of the summer,4
9018,not quite as exciting as avengers 1 but still a great fun action movie about family,4
9019,a refreshing superhero movie living up to the trailers or expectation and feels like the comics,4
9020,it adds to the story of tony stark robert downey jr,4
9021,ultron with sense of humor i would say it is near as great as the original movie,4
9022,but that's what make it great it's not that perfect but it's amazing,4
9023,chris pratt is the best part of this movie had me laughing so hard these moments were fitted into the script perfectly,4
9024,much better sendoff for the character of tony stark iron man being both hilarious and intelligent,4
9025,that's all i have to say all the action scenes had a purpose and they were incredibly gripping,4
9026,it's a weird thing seeing downey as iron man and a exciting beginning for a whole universe of heroes,4
9027,the avengers was even better than the first one gotg vol,4
9028,ant man is one of marvel's classics,4
9029,really well made and really really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
9030,and the after credits sequence was one of the most fun movies ever and it still manages to be creative with the action scenes,4
9031,this is still a spider-man film that came before it including toby,4
9032,i was slightly expecting more but i wasn't particularly interested in them,4
9033,the action is once again spectacular and the cgi is sometimes not excellent especially on the ants,4
9034,sure the villain in the movie is a wonderful breath of fresh air after all that heaviness,4
9035,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
9036,that's why i give avengers age of ultron this was a way more enjoyable experience to me,4
9037,great movie just as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action spectacle finale,4
9038,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
9039,keaton brings a strong villain performance but like all the other marvel films this is one of the best,4
9040,the only flaw i have with this movie is i wanted more hulk,4
9041,this one however is probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it but only wish there was more action,4
9042,the only thing that holds this movie back from being better than the avengers in my opinion the fight scenes action was mind twisting,4
9043,on top of that it was one of the classic aspects of the movie,4
9044,i do not understand all the hatred in this movie it's not without its consequences or collateral damage,4
9045,marvel's approach to super-hero movies of the new marvel generation,4
9046,being the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best and another perfect marvel movie and setup for new characters,4
9047,ant-man is both entertaining and a mostly satisfying sequel,4
9048,too much was overwhelmingly confusing but i love the second half of the movie,4
9049,really not much to say movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
9050,jackson shows up but iron man 2 is still a great actor,4
9051,i didn't love the fight scenes in this movie are probably the best action scenes ever in any movie,4
9052,the film is hilarious which seems to be the only one who thinks a rocket and howard team up needs to happen,4
9053,and overall it set the tone for what we now know as the mcu,4
9054,it isn't quite the breath of fresh air is the creative visual style and character focused storytelling,4
9055,it was a lot of fun with great performances from robert downey jr,4
9056,what whedon has created for this film is the villain unfortunately,4
9057,one of the better mcu films only thing that i really didn't think it was that good at all,4
9058,i do feel however that there were areas in which they could've cut a few jokes,4
9059,looking back it feels like this builds up and pays off with one hell of an action-comedy marvel film,4
9060,came very close to being as good as the previous film it is still a must see film,4
9061,def two thumbs up and can't wait to see where they go from here,4
9062,by the film's dedication to high-octane action sequences allowing even non-comics fans can enjoy,4
9063,at times it feels overstuffed and its not as good as the 97 rotten tomatoes score says,4
9064,and i don't know about you but i can not wait of the second one,4
9065,the movie was funny at the right times and the action can be uninteresting but overall fits nicely into the marvel franchise,4
9066,and most importantly tom holland and his down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
9067,i think most people would like this movie as much as i did,4
9068,probably the best decision they made in this movie however there were a few pacing issues,4
9069,one of the more action packed marvel films in recent years antman stood out as one that i was keen to see,4
9070,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
9071,tom holland also happens to be one of the best marvel movie yet,4
9072,it was nice to see stark dealing with his inner demons and his character was more human than ever in this installment,4
9073,i defiantly look forward to seeing iron man in the the invincible iron man comic invincible,4
9074,stark's likeable asshole as described by director jon favreau iron man ranks among the finest in marvel movies to date,4
9075,stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the suits and action is worth it,4
9076,this prevents many possible emotional moments that could have been done a bit better but really was good enough,4
9077,i found this much better than the second not quite as good as the first and second viewing,4
9078,avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
9079,except for the choice of song but that's just the geek inside me,4
9080,the plot moves very well thanks to the fact it's one of the reasons of their success must be the casting,4
9081,the characters were intriguing the action was aggressive and the story was good still i give this one 4,4
9082,this movie will go down in history as one of the best superhero flicks i've seen,4
9083,the first time i've ever seen on the big screen,4
9084,also brian tyler made a moving score and a good villain in my opinion,4
9085,the visuals pop and there are a lot of those and sly whedonesque humor,4
9086,this explains a good movie im looking forward to seeing another one,4
9087,this is one of the most charismatic and tantalizing comic book villains we've seen in every superhero-movie ever,4
9088,whedon knows how to direct a superhero movie,4
9089,i've seen a lot of squabble on the internet of people trying to tell a bunch of stories at once,4
9090,the film has a great cast of characters funny humor and some great action set pieces tinged with humour an overall great time,4
9091,came very close to being as good as the first this sequel comes close with solid performances and a good funny script,4
9092,easily one of the best wow moments i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
9093,78 100 ant-man is just as great as the first,4
9094,should have been the wasp and ant-man is a witty clever movie,4
9095,nothing is going to be a good movie but not the best,4
9096,this is a movie for those who are fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
9097,at first i thought this was a really fun and cool film,4
9098,if not i will explain it to you if it is a good film and the avengers purpose was to entertain,4
9099,it could've been a lot better but other than that i'm cool with them being together,4
9100,it's not quite the best spider-man movie you could make,4
9101,this chemistry led to one of the best films from marvel studios,4
9102,i loved this movie and it is certainly one of the best ones yet compared to the first installment,4
9103,must like batman begins there isn't lots of action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
9104,besides a character arc that occurs with iron man there is lesser ambition with the writing surrounding him in iron man 2,4
9105,i love all the action and humor we've come to expect from marvel,4
9106,most importantly it can be enjoyed as a stand-alone film for him was a bold move by disney,4
9107,strengths director ryan coogler had a lot of fun and its has focus where the other two have vision,4
9108,a near perfect return to the iron man series falls in between the first and second movies,4
9109,so much of the film's best moments,4
9110,hawkeye has more character development than he did in the first avengers movie it is still a worthy effort from marvel,4
9111,i mean the character of killmonger was written well but he just didn't fit the character in my opinion,4
9112,while part 2 is really fun and has a lot of action a lot of laughs out of me,4
9113,the action sequences are entertaining even if it was heavier on comedic sight gags,4
9114,this film was shot with 8 actors chris evans as captain america and he might be my favorite character,4
9115,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one is like the worst of the marvel cinematic universe,4
9116,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and ant man is proof of that,4
9117,definitely a big difference between iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2 so no more comparisons,4
9118,if there was anything i didn't like the first thor movie i still admire his character,4
9119,overall grade a 92 % notes marvellous hero character development not too much for the villain s,4
9120,i wish that doc oc or venom was back on the big screen with great set-pieces performances and dialogue between the characters,4
9121,michael pena as luis is probably my favorite movie of all time,4
9122,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that came out in 2003,4
9123,i can't recall anything that happened in the first two films and the previous avengers,4
9124,but still the villain wasn't that good,4
9125,scott decides to toy with it and what follows is tony being pushed back up into a wall,4
9126,though it's emotionally better than the first film but it's up there,4
9127,this movie has done an amazing job of popularizing iron man and that says a lot considering the power is pretty ridiculous,4
9128,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the second one,4
9129,the action and effects were amazing and it has a highly likable protagonist,4
9130,the best spider-man movie but not as good as the first but still a good film,4
9131,also does justice for the ant-man movies is perfect,4
9132,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
9133,this movie was great but not as great as the first 2 but it was a better movie that avengers ii age of ultron,4
9134,is it a fun action-packed and very cool to see,4
9135,a real improvement over ang lee's more psychological yet boring take on the character of spider-man right,4
9136,the avengers is truly one of marvel's best and funniest films to date,4
9137,also have fun trying to pick out which is the best member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity,4
9138,little inappropriate at the beginning but i really like the addition of ironman to this movie in the mentor role,4
9139,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of the best marvel movies,4
9140,gives us one of the best marvel movies,4
9141,ant-man is an awesome superhero movie,4
9142,after that i knew that mcu's next movie was ant-man and the wasp makes it uncommonly refreshing,4
9143,the story was excellent and woven into the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
9144,can't wait to see more of in the mcu,4
9145,i watched ironman3 because i am a fan of ant-man movies,4
9146,despite the great acting from the actor of ned tom holland and michael keaton seriously nail the hero-villain complements,4
9147,topping the first film is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
9148,and most importantly tom holland and his down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
9149,the biggest issue with number 2 was that the film didn't work out the potential well,4
9150,the best part is that he was one of the most fun you'll have at the movies,4
9151,if so by all means go watch it,4
9152,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best comic book movie villains ever,4
9153,definitely liked this one better than the second installment if not quite as good as the first one,4
9154,i think this is just a minor qualm,4
9155,not bad for a culmination of 10 years worth of build up and demonstrates a new trend in movie franchises,4
9156,but the producers do a great job in this light hearted superhero movie is what was needed,4
9157,though it turns into a slugfest like any hulk story this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
9158,probably one of my fav mcu movies loved everything about it but only wish there was more action,4
9159,i went and saw this movie with my dad and a lot of fun with great action characters and can be funny as anything,4
9160,when the villainous norse demi-god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good,4
9161,i realized that i ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time and probably the last one since the marvel cinematic universe,4
9162,didn't expect this film to be one of the mcu's best villain,4
9163,at just 15-years-old this spider-man demonstrates humility and maturity,4
9164,while avengers age of ultron is a solid sequel in an amazing franchise,4
9165,marvel does a good job at being real and emotionally down-to-earth and best of all relatable,4
9166,after a successful heist of a seemingly not-so-big-scale no pun intended,4
9167,i'm raving that iron man is the well-rounded spider-man movie that's been released,4
9168,marvel's ant-man is a great start to phase 2,4
9169,funny as hell and keeps you on the edge of your seat thriller to the very end with a cast of likable characters,4
9170,pym storm into a shield meeting room with howard stark john slattery and fan-favorite peggy carter hayley atwell,4
9171,a lot of people this was more than just a real goodtime action flick,4
9172,gotg is unlike any of the movies in the marvel franchise,4
9173,i knew he was a questionable character but a surprise i did not see the original film before watching this one which i regret now,4
9174,i'd definitely watch it again and again,4
9175,packed with humour action great visuals and a bunch of random characters to work,4
9176,the dialog and storytelling were impeccable and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end but still the weakest of 2018,4
9177,the avengers is one example of how to make a damn good sci-fi movie which guardians of the galaxy,4
9178,he is super witty and fun to watch develop as the movie progressed,4
9179,this film is good the special effects are gorgeous and really well done,4
9180,but the villain ultron james spader doesn't feel compelling and avengers age of ultron this time with even more characters thrown into the mix,4
9181,however there are brief moments where the film drags for me,4
9182,the story is packed with new characters and bigger even more impressive action sequences,4
9183,another weakness of the movie lies in the plot and throughout the film,4
9184,the movie itself is full of good actions scenes and even though i saw the character arc with his dad it was interesting,4
9185,i actually ended up liking this movie more than the first it was a fun ride given he was a minor superhero,4
9186,overall still a pretty good movie but i look forward to more interaction between them in future films,4
9187,was not expecting it to especially with drax and most especially yandu,4
9188,i realized that i ended up enjoying this allot more for the second time and probably the last one since the marvel cinematic universe,4
9189,well talk about one of the most underrated marvel movie,4
9190,not too emotional like avengers infinity war and black panther i confirm this,4
9191,this movie had potential but it didn't bog down the movie,4
9192,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the marvel set-ups by a long shtot,4
9193,overall this is easily one of the best movies of all time,4
9194,before i continue what makes this better than iron man 2 but it isn't anywhere close to the first,4
9195,killian just was one of the most fun you'll have at the movies,4
9196,the only seen that was awesome is the scene where iron man and war machine you can't complain even if you tried,4
9197,in fact the whole start in the cave is my favourite part in the movie that makes your heart wrench like the original picture,4
9198,it offers amazing visuals and plenty of action to satify film goers,4
9199,jordan as eric killmonger is hands-down the best villain the mcu has ever seen in my opinion,4
9200,not the best movie in the series but it's still a worthy sequel to iron man 2 and possibly better than iron man 2,4
9201,this is spectacularly fun and tom holland and michael keaton are absolutely fantastic in this film,4
9202,the characters are just as awesome as the first one but usually thats how sequels work nowdays,4
9203,it works itself as a standalone film and does exactly what it wants to be and goes and gets it,4
9204,the movie we were all waiting for finally hit the big screen and i'm happy to say that the rest isn't good,4
9205,great new addition to the comic book fans,4
9206,well it wasn't bad at all but where the hell is ant-man's powers come to life in the best possible way,4
9207,though it wasn't better than the first but not quite enough,4
9208,getting kiss kiss bang bang including all of the characters and had a psychological aspect to them,4
9209,has after the battle of new york from the first movie i can think of robert downy jr,4
9210,plays the part he was born for the role of james rhodey rhodes than terrence howard,4
9211,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
9212,what is going to happen to ant-man is a pretty solid entry in the mcu,4
9213,i am happy to say that the rest isn't good,4
9214,he was an idiot in civil war and this delivery i have to say i expected this to totally suck,4
9215,there isn't much humor but there is lots of fun to be had by a pretty stellar cast,4
9216,a truly sensational way to tie together the marvel cinematic universe except maybe in the first half and a few segments dragged for me,4
9217,this is my favorite iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
9218,it is the funniest marvel movie and it's most definitely my favorite spider-man actor,4
9219,paul rudd michael douglas and evangeline lilly the rest of the cast is hit and miss,4
9220,a great payoff to one of the best comic book movies of all time guardians of the galaxy,4
9221,now that the background has been established iron man 2's story easier to follow the 2nd time around,4
9222,ant-man is one of my favorite comic book movies,4
9223,but still a power-house installment in the marvel cinematic universe in total begins here and what a excellent beginning it was,4
9224,can't wait to see it again to see if it gets better the second time,4
9225,the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great the visual effects are mind boggling and pleasing to the eye,4
9226,it works itself as a standalone film as well as part of the franchise,4
9227,much debate has occurred whether many character deaths are permanent and whether or not that's remotely up their alley,4
9228,the best phase 1 marvel film of the year that year robert downey jr plays in is damn good,4
9229,the supporting cast namely jacob batalon as ned and zendaya as michelle,4
9230,it's kind of funny that the cheesiest of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
9231,infinity war is a film of great comedic value that doesn't try to be an iron man or avengers,4
9232,the only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with the hulk a non-stop thrill ride,4
9233,i can't say it was as good as it was as the latest marvel films have been a little better,4
9234,i know i am in a minority but i think this is the best spider-man,4
9235,it was great to see a superhero movie that even non-comics fans to appreciate,4
9236,although it has a few comedy scenes here and there just so it doesn't cloud the movie like other superhero movies have fallen into,4
9237,this film was good but i feel that this honestly works better for the sake of my curiosity,4
9238,unfortunately the plot is a little predictable and cliche but it's still entertaining to watch,4
9239,not as strong as the first movie but i liked it a lot for me it was on the peripheral of my musical awareness,4
9240,i know its the story of the film and it was very entertaining,4
9241,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great to see ant man have a partner helping him,4
9242,probably the best of the mcu but itãâ´s a movie with good action acting and it is really funny too,4
9243,on top of that it was one of the best marvel movie but it's certainly over the halfway hump,4
9244,you'll expect the same level of the starter original,4
9245,but robert downey jr was too much of a destructive action which was not needed,4
9246,rd jr nails the part and this film still stands as one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen,4
9247,chadwick boseman is incredible as the lead and the supporting cast are all somewhere between competent and great,4
9248,the one thing that i really liked but did have some scenes i didn't care to be honest,4
9249,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the second not as good as the 1st movie,4
9250,this isn't your typical marvel film plot but it isn't funny anymore despite attempts at humour,4
9251,it's darker than the first but not quite enough,4
9252,john favreau includes several genres in the film enabling it to have a normal act structure and character development,4
9253,but it is nonetheless one of the most anticipated superhero movies ever,4
9254,it was sometimes a bit distracting but it didn't bog down the movie,4
9255,8 10 points go to the development category,4
9256,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy has the right blend of comedy action and special effects as well,4
9257,it's worth all the hype and is one of the funniest comic book films i've seen in awhile,4
9258,and even baby groot may have took the movie from the rest of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
9259,some characters act make decisions that seem unlike them and that can be disappointing considering their role in the comics,4
9260,but with two sets of spider-man swinging around on buildings,4
9261,but i felt it's not as good as the original,4
9262,great movie but didn't have the fallout with marvel,4
9263,it's a perfect fit into the mcu and one that was better than it had any right to be if you have,4
9264,hands down the best in the mcu actually having a motivation that makes sense and has action throughout,4
9265,the action looks great and it's fun to see spider-man in the comics is that he makes all of his tech himself,4
9266,but there was too much dialog that could have been done a bit better but really was good enough,4
9267,the introduction of vision was awesome paul bettany did a great job at including all of the characters,4
9268,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
9269,this was a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
9270,played very well the role of tony stark iron man he seems to be undergoing growth as a man and a human being,4
9271,i loved it but not as much as the first one if that,4
9272,tom holland shows us the kid in spider-man far from home peter will develop this self-reliability,4
9273,it basically has everything for a marvel film but it is part of the mcu now,4
9274,it's just a cg creation so i didn't feel that there were many stakes in this movie,4
9275,granted there are a few connections to the rest of the movie is focused on stark developing the iron man suit are fantastic,4
9276,16 20 points go to the writing category,4
9277,i really enjoyed the 2015 ant-man film and for that i liked it even more,4
9278,tom holland is absolutely terrific and the high school angst is well captured,4
9279,while i liked both the raimi and webb films spider-man homecoming was directed by jon watts and released july 7th 2017,4
9280,my one negative about this movie is a non-stop thrill ride,4
9281,the incredible hulk as opposed to ang lee's film too bad for lee,4
9282,the movie has it's problems in the third act as if he is legolas from ãâ¢the lord of the ringsãâ¢,4
9283,score 9plot it's an enjoyable trip from start to finish with drax and baby groot stealing the show,4
9284,away from the spectacular action sequences and plenty of wit,4
9285,ant-man is a great way to start off phase 2 of the avengers films,4
9286,this movie puts you at the edge of your seat till the very end,4
9287,the incredible hulk is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
9288,i didn't think infinity war was anything ground breaking however it is still one of better phase 2 films,4
9289,great soundtrack and easily some of the best cgi i have ever seen,4
9290,spider-man homecoming is really fun to watch thanks james gunn for that,4
9291,overall though if this movie had a lot of fun,4
9292,the area where whedon has impressed me is the last part which is fight with last boss in the film,4
9293,the special effects are on point and the action is amazing and it's just a fun movie overall,4
9294,comic book fans are mad about this i'm not a big fan of the marvel movies since it has such a low score,4
9295,the only thing that holds this movie back from being better than the avengers in my opinion the 2 previous spidermans lacked ex,4
9296,i went in expecting more of the same from the first outing,4
9297,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was in that film and before the events of avengers infinity war,4
9298,it is the funniest marvel movie to date,4
9299,not as good as the 1st one and it may not be one of the best superhero movies ever,4
9300,a great addition to the cast in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
9301,finally another good spider-man movie i've seen in awhile,4
9302,basically as good as it's predecessor it contains an epic villain the abomination,4
9303,there is just so much going on in this corner of the mcu,4
9304,michael keaton is probably one of the best superhero movies to this day,4
9305,in the first ant man and captain america civil war that promises to be awesome,4
9306,the only few problems i had with the film is the way it takes the safety of the world,4
9307,so if you're looking for the joker,4
9308,especially at the climax of the little mermaid,4
9309,this guy is amazing and the russo brothers did a great job,4
9310,you do feel like there's a lot of iron man armors in here,4
9311,ant-man is a great introduction to the marvel universe,4
9312,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best spider-man movie series amp combines them nicely,4
9313,it was a bit superheroes tour of the world at times and didn't have to go to the theater and have some fun,4
9314,although he is barely in his suit the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch,4
9315,if you liked the first one this is the movie to see it was funny and creative,4
9316,the soundtrack is also especially well-done and honestly the best part of this spidey flick no origin story,4
9317,a great film has a great sense of wit and humor surprisingly impressive cgi action sequences and a truly great story line,4
9318,is great as tony stark iron man robert downey jr,4
9319,i give tony a full 5 out of 5 stars if i didn't have to tie into the big conflicts of the universe,4
9320,not only did marvel make us care about a raccoon and a tree,4
9321,the villain obadiah stane is one of the better entries in the mcu,4
9322,i don't know much about the ant-man costume is kinda like scuba-divers to me,4
9323,if you're a creationist you may or may not have for the hero,4
9324,bill foster to the mcu as well as hannah john-kamen ghost and randall park woo,4
9325,it is safe to say he was a great villain and michael keaton was for real,4
9326,it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the more under rated movies of the mcu,4
9327,knows everything there is to know about the main characters and the action is incredibly exciting,4
9328,the plot of the movie is the definition of a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
9329,but ant-man and the wasp is one of the best movies of 2018,4
9330,i also for one appreciated the scenes between tony and pepper that really extenuate the movie's charms,4
9331,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
9332,i liked this superhero movie more than most of the marvel cinematic universe would never be so great,4
9333,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as the first but it's worth watching,4
9334,love the special effects and a good cast,4
9335,just as good as the first one but still very enjoyable thrill ride,4
9336,a fun and enjoyable movie with tons of humour and a little bit of old fashioned is a line delivered by colseson,4
9337,did i mention how cool the scenes were when ant-man was such a popular character that he ended up getting a sequel,4
9338,marvel's the avengers thor and guardians of the galaxy and suicide squad as the two franchises comedy movies,4
9339,tony stark robert downey jr is one of the best movies in the entire series,4
9340,just like its predecessor iron man 2 still manages to be an entertaining and quite heartfelt blockbuster,4
9341,but i surely want to see him more and more,4
9342,the one part that was better than it had any right to be without feeling tied down by the franchise on the whole,4
9343,i thought it was just a little bit more action to it to make it more exciting,4
9344,in 2008 we got the hulk movie that we always wanted,4
9345,ant man and the wasp initial reaction better than ant-man and the wasp 8 10 stars,4
9346,a new career definitely makes this one of the best marvel films to date,4
9347,along with that the antagonist of the central villain ayesha,4
9348,it's too bad this movie had so much heart and humor,4
9349,at the start the film is a very strong action film,4
9350,generally it's just a fun movie overall,4
9351,iron man 3 finally answers the question does the suit make the hero or does the hero make the suit,4
9352,easily one of the best wow moments i've ever seen in a marvel film,4
9353,great performances all around make it overcome the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
9354,i was really hoping for this film to come out thor,4
9355,not as good as the first one didn't have those problems,4
9356,i believed rudd as the hero and villain this film,4
9357,the colors and music in this movie was so much fun,4
9358,it's better than the 2003 film the incredible hulk is still an exciting entry from marvel,4
9359,but i would have to say the standout hero of this film turns out to be highly enjoyable and fun,4
9360,regardless i enjoyed it thoroughly and the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of avengers infinity war,4
9361,now the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the most amazing individual super-hero movies of 2014,4
9362,after the disappointment of the second film this one manages to escape the cartoonish feeling of the it's predecessor,4
9363,in fact i like it better than iron man 2 so i didn't feel any emotions there,4
9364,phenomenal this by far is one of the best movies i have seen,4
9365,it sadly doesn't live up to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
9366,guardians of the galaxy is one of the best structured villains since darth vader,4
9367,though the movie may lack the emotional stakes of previous mcu movies it's got a perfectly balanced blend of comedy and gripping action,4
9368,a bit long of a stretch but it's a rather good movie story is ok,4
9369,bravo on the makeup and the set pieces are well done and michael b,4
9370,in fact his whole presence was the best part of this movie though he is awesome as a actor great film,4
9371,i'm glad this was the movie that got me into comic books,4
9372,super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes,4
9373,weaknesses like a lot of marvel films guardians of the galaxy is a great fun summer movie with fantastic special effects and story,4
9374,while this isn't as good as the first one,4
9375,the sound track is as good as it predecessor but it is still iron man and rdj is still king,4
9376,a standard marvel movie with a good twist,4
9377,this movie could have been better in some ways you can't afford to miss this,4
9378,though it might be the weakest mcu film in phase 3 so far,4
9379,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
9380,when the villainous norse demi-god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good,4
9381,i'll be the first to admit that most of the films in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9382,stellar action sequences that would make star wars proud and all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
9383,the writing is much better and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
9384,the story was great but a little cluttered at times and the action can be uninteresting but overall fits nicely into the marvel franchise,4
9385,one of the better parts of the movie it seems like there is going to be a long year,4
9386,a lot of layers making one care about heroes and villains you've never heard of,4
9387,louder and larger than the first film and the action is a bit underwhelming,4
9388,i think most people would like this movie as much as i can,4
9389,it's also the funniest out of the trilogy not unlike many other trilogies,4
9390,in my opinion iron man was a great start to a great series that never stops,4
9391,maybe my expectations were too high but i left the theater immediately wanting to see it again,4
9392,now that being said its insane that about three quarters of the movie was a bit choppy the movie has great pacing,4
9393,i just can't imagine anyone else playing the playboy philanthropist tony stark,4
9394,the best scenes in my opinion continue to be when he is in the shadows so you can't see how to beat him,4
9395,obviously this movie plays more for laughs than some of the other marvel films this is one of my favorite marvel movies,4
9396,the fight scene between ant-man and the wasp is a great movie to kick off the fantastic marvel avengers franchise,4
9397,pursued by the military who want to use the hulk to save new york city from ultimate disaster,4
9398,definitley check it out it's one of the big strengths of this movie the dialogue,4
9399,absolutely amazing with some of the scenes felt like they were trying to re-use jokes from the first movie,4
9400,it's darker than the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe that hasn't been said before,4
9401,a fantastic main villain a great cast and all of the other mcu movies,4
9402,the villain is pretty standard marvel which is a shame since he is my favorite hero,4
9403,2 doesn't deliver as much as its predecessor it still offers a fun story a great performance from michael b,4
9404,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
9405,there are both dick and poop jokes which i'm usually not a fan of super-hero movies is through humour,4
9406,happy has a bigger role in this film especially at the end,4
9407,it always has to be another duel with another player and you can't see him that well,4
9408,great movie if you haven't seen this by now that's a mouth-full,4
9409,the talents of favreau and downey come together to make iron man 3 period piece during christmas paid off,4
9410,he doesn't care about power he's just trying to make an opinion about how i feel for this movie,4
9411,it's an improvement over the first and one of the best looking films of the year,4
9412,from the onset there is a palpable edge to it all,4
9413,michael keaton also makes for a great tony stark and this movie also had so much heart and humor,4
9414,as of the end of the first movie but i liked it a lot,4
9415,everything feels right in this movie and laughed alot more than i thought it was a well written story,4
9416,i did think some of the jokes miss their mark but ant-man is a great movie gripping interesting and thrilling,4
9417,if it wasn't for this film i very much enjoyed,4
9418,action and adventure for the kids and just down right entertaining,4
9419,they both want the powers of the black panther joining the avengers i don't know what they're missing,4
9420,and after all isn't fun what these pictures are supposed to be fun but this one also showed the darker side of tony stark,4
9421,the tone i found this film to be darker than the first one and starts to set things up well for the avengers,4
9422,first time i saw this i thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy,4
9423,overall it's a fun entertaining movie with a combination of superhero and heist film,4
9424,im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be a joke thrown in and it almost becomes overbearing,4
9425,it works the only thing that's negative about this movie is a whole lot of big things,4
9426,everyone has something different to bring to the film and gives an identity to usual cannon fodder,4
9427,see basically the same movie as the first one but this one brings a nice movie to the table,4
9428,also they should have killed hawkeye because i don't think it's because of the film's heart is found in tony stark,4
9429,not only is it one of the best movie of the summer,4
9430,this film is one of my top 3 marvel movies of all time for me at least,4
9431,after my first viewing i was disappointed but that mainly had to do with the homecoming of the school and i'm glad i did,4
9432,its the sequel of ant-man at 60 feet,4
9433,he adds an emotional depth to a character that could have easily been simplified for a nicer contrast with the pym's,4
9434,shame edward norton didn't stay with us in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character ever,4
9435,his interaction with the others feel real and it is great marvel didn't fall into this trap,4
9436,fun and enjoyable a nice new take on spider-man since this is his own movie,4
9437,they have to work well together be likable and they have to go out there and take him in for justice,4
9438,due to its presence in the mcu it is also a very strong standalone entry that can be enjoyed by the whole family,4
9439,unlike most people i thought the sequel was even better than the first avengers in every way,4
9440,the characters let us remember why we loved them in the first movie and it does have some flaws,4
9441,a pretty decent action flick sequel from beginning to end we had fight scene after fight scene after fight scene,4
9442,hands down one of the best super-hero movies but i am a fan not only of the black panther,4
9443,let me just close by saying that if this is going to be a lot more interesting than others depending on the viewer,4
9444,there have already been two big screen origin adaptations of spider-man and they did it well,4
9445,the subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between ant-man and the wasp is a fun summer popcorn movie,4
9446,has never been better as the post-avengers mcu and did so while being a fun thrill ride for the eyes,4
9447,this is an extremely funny and good looking movie with an interesting plot and amazing special effects,4
9448,an interesting addition to the mcu antman as a film doesn't do much with the racial issue which may be a good thing,4
9449,it has good jokes sprinkled throughout and many twists i did not expect to like this movie but ended up loving every minute,4
9450,the movie was damn near perfect with the right amount of vulnerability here to show that tony stark is far from perfect,4
9451,the entire third act i just had a blast with this film,4
9452,so much of the film is rather static,4
9453,i cant wait to see it again that's how much fun i had with a movie this year,4
9454,the especial effects are still fantastic and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is a pleasure to watch and the definitive spiderman,4
9455,the incredible hulk is the hulk movie that was titled the incredible hulk,4
9456,like the previous installment iron man 3 is my personal favourite of the trilogy,4
9457,the humor works in this film and despite the villain is not as interesting as in past spidey movies but homecoming still succeeds,4
9458,finally hip hop is represented in marvel's cinematic universe with their phase 1 films leading up to this moment,4
9459,there was not enough action in the movie doesn't fail in any way,4
9460,my seven year old daughter loved it but i didn't actually hate it,4
9461,this is the best marvel movie but it was pretty good,4
9462,i went in expecting more of the same from the first outing,4
9463,a near perfect return to the iron man movie and it keeps you interested still,4
9464,the only flaw is that the villain isn't explored nearly enough but the story really works,4
9465,in marvel's attempt to bring ant-man to no longer be an underrated superhero,4
9466,i connected more to norton and tyler than i ever could so i'll let you hear the details from him,4
9467,one of my favourite because he is voiced by vin diesel but stripped of his whistle controlled plasma arrow,4
9468,tom holland is an amazing spider-man of them all,4
9469,amazing characters a deep antagonist good direction and great action sequences but its corny too and a little predictable,4
9470,i am tired of origin stories and i am tired of having iron man face against another scientist for the third time,4
9471,tom hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time but it's also a great setup for next years highly anticipated infinity wars,4
9472,to start off the mcu while having one of the best it's had to offer,4
9473,i thought it was a good marvel movie,4
9474,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters and the story of ant-man,4
9475,infinity war may not be the revolution in superhero film which was the dark knight but this is a must-see,4
9476,as good if not better than spider-man 2 i would watch it sparingly so as not to become annoyed with the humor,4
9477,many regard this as one of the best marvel cinematic universe movies to date if not the best opening sequences in movie history,4
9478,i find tony stark's life style to be very similar to the last jedi's final scene a little boy starts dreaming,4
9479,besides some incredible cgi effects the movie had a great deal of fun,4
9480,having to fill the shoes of the first film is a great replacement for jon favreau,4
9481,the storyline is well cut and the special effects action is amazingly cool,4
9482,he is a genetically altered raccoon with a troubled past once again played flawlessly by mr,4
9483,the first entry into the mcu and even after all the spider-man film built into the marvel cinematic universe,4
9484,guardians of the galaxy will provoke you hype for the following films of the marvel cinematic universe this movie is absolutely fantastic to me,4
9485,someone who has one of the best in the iron man suit instead of the clashing rivalry with stane,4
9486,i was not expecting a lot that way i wasn't going to work but they have played it brilliantly,4
9487,marvel's approach to super-hero movies you'll see,4
9488,this movie is fun for the whole family and it deserves a high rating just not sure as high as a 96,4
9489,iron man is back to the iron man we all know and love,4
9490,one of the best superhero films of the 21st century it seems both sincere and complex without easy answers,4
9491,iron man 3 was a great film but it just doesn't flow as well as the supporting cast,4
9492,downey jr is perfect as stark iron man as well as for his appearance,4
9493,although he is barely in his suit the action scenes are thrilling and the comedy is well placed,4
9494,overall a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe couldn't have been done better,4
9495,marvel's ant-man to steal the yellowjacket suit from his old protege darren cross corey stoll,4
9496,if it fails beyond this so be it tom holland does a great job in this light hearted superhero movie is what was needed,4
9497,ant-man might not be as awesome as the first film the sequel delivers in all forms of entertainment,4
9498,not just a great superhero movie what does,4
9499,and yet the final product peyton reed's ant-man to michael pena's luis,4
9500,not being a hardcore comic book fan to enjoy this one as it can be a highly entertaining time for all,4
9501,great way to introduce a review for a superhero movie that even non superhero fans can enjoy,4
9502,this movie is fun and the action is not what makes the film i found it highly enjoyable,4
9503,judging by the ending of the film was intense all the way through,4
9504,furthermore guardians of the galaxy until this movie came out with so much hype and it definitely delivered in my book,4
9505,mark ruffalo does a great job of introducing ant-man,4
9506,everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job of setting up an even more important villain thanos,4
9507,the villain is a little shallow but that is the core of the movie,4
9508,the characters continue to be fun and the visuals are even more impressive than before,4
9509,super fun to watch if you have not seen it then go see it you won't be disappointed,4
9510,robert downing jr's portrayal of the character is one of the best superhero films totally worth your time,4
9511,he is the highlight of the movie was a dumb popcorn fun entertainment,4
9512,it's story is very good and i love the casting that has been done,4
9513,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good laughs in this marvel movie,4
9514,i loved the first guardians and i didn't fall asleep like i did to the first one,4
9515,jackson maria hill cobie smulders to random world war ii vets i can guess are friends of captain america etc,4
9516,great performances all around make it overcome the fact that the main characters are not caucasian,4
9517,fun and entertaining not as awesome as the first film did but this time it's a solo ride since captain america the first avenger,4
9518,guardians of the galaxy the funniest of the marvel cinematic universe a revolutionary series of superhero movie and this has it all,4
9519,the only place i feel this film is very underrated,4
9520,when parker confronted him towards the end of the film all of the characters and had a psychological aspect to them,4
9521,while this isn't as good as its predecessor it still offers a charming paul rudd as the ant-man a surprise hit,4
9522,overall this is a great movie as it balances emotion and humour very well and i hope no one else plays iron man,4
9523,at least i didn't miss anything in spider-man 1 amp 2overall a 9,4
9524,the reception for this film was all over the place and can fall great distances without getting hurt,4
9525,well the movie is about scott lang aka ant-man scott lang is under house arrest after the events of captain america civil war,4
9526,it's not the movie that you could watch over and over again to enjoy it,4
9527,but robert downey jr was too much of a destructive action which was not needed,4
9528,while not the thrill ride and lore roller coaster its predecessor avengers infinity war was enough to make me cry like a fucking baby,4
9529,i like the plot cgi is great fight scenes are great to watch amp very well choreographed,4
9530,the avengers is a fantastic translation of the silver age of comics to the big-screen thanks to holland's incredibly moving performance,4
9531,a breath of fresh air that iron man was a great start and one of marvel's biggest superhero's which fufilled my expectations,4
9532,at just 15-years-old this spider-man is the best comic book movies of all time,4
9533,the action was awesome and their was just enough comedy but it didn't take away from the film as a whole,4
9534,one of my favorite trilogies of all time the dark knight trilogy as i don't see why it has such a low score,4
9535,i am not a fan of this one but i still think this film kicks ass,4
9536,the effects are great to look at and the chemistry between evangeline lilly and paul rudd is perfect as antman,4
9537,this is the best movie out of phase one and a solid entry into the marvel universe,4
9538,pym wants lang to break into his old business pym tech and steal the yellowjacket suit as an act of redemption,4
9539,the writing is much better and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
9540,it looked like it was going to be worse than the first one but this film blew me away,4
9541,it was one of the many who thought this film would be nothing to be honest,4
9542,it had a decent story to go with the large amount of people fighting on screen at once,4
9543,it does not stack up against the first ant-man 4 stars i felt this was a more complete story i got invested,4
9544,main characters t'challa black panther he's a mix of iron man and while the villains aren't anything noteworthy,4
9545,tom holland did an amazing job with their roles,4
9546,the biggest strength of the film is the villain unfortunately,4
9547,to mainstream player and i'm excited for the next avengers sequels,4
9548,i really enjoyed the 2015 ant-man film was a lighthearted entry into the mcu that succeeded in filling the hype,4
9549,doesn't take itself as seriously as the first one but still very good,4
9550,when same old purposes still work good when we attach ourselves to them when they know how to make a perfect crossover movie not too,4
9551,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe version of the character was sort of good,4
9552,guardians of the galaxy is the most fun i've had with a film in quite some time,4
9553,it better be one hell of a ride that you can enjoy,4
9554,it does run a bit too long in my opinion and kurt russell did a fine job as ego,4
9555,it's a great film with great action sequences and great special effects,4
9556,the characters and the story of ant-man from the original avengers comics,4
9557,storyincase you have not seen it then go see it you won't be sorry,4
9558,i'd give it a solid 82 %,4
9559,with surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast it may not be the best movie of the summer,4
9560,a little too silly at times but it still makes me smile,4
9561,soundtrack is one of the mcu's most surprisingly funny movie yet,4
9562,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest villains in the mcu are pretty disposable,4
9563,while this isn't as good as the first but still a whole lot of fun,4
9564,it's also one of the most colourfull space films i have ever seen in a marvel film,4
9565,in addition to that the fighting was amazing and the suit looked much much better than the first,4
9566,the film is flawed but fun and unlike all the other marvel films the action scenes are really awesome to look at,4
9567,he almost seem condescending and it's a blast to watch from beginning to end,4
9568,all of the action and comedy make sure it doesn't feel at all natural,4
9569,i hope the character will emerge from the shadow of the larger world of heroes namely the avengers,4
9570,one of the best ones yet compared to the first half of agents of s,4
9571,marvel has done a great job bringing these heroes together,4
9572,the writing was fine but i feel like they didn't push it all the way,4
9573,all of the acting is questionable this installment in the mcu thus far but in this case they make amends,4
9574,the visuals and action stylistically i think this film is better then the ang lee hulk that film was boring,4
9575,fun time another good addition to the mcu and that's what makes it so great,4
9576,decent and entertaining although not as good as the first iron man but still fun,4
9577,despite a few minor flaws this movie is a buy go out and add it to your collection,4
9578,even with some noticeable tonal problems iron man 3 is another visually stunning movie under marvel's belt,4
9579,in the hands of nerd icon joss whedon to write and direct the very first team up,4
9580,and the overall story was interesting and the humor was excellent,4
9581,in addition to a lot of new doors bring on the sequel i say,4
9582,a strange film to be called an iron man movie that really lived up to the hype,4
9583,loved the africa-centric theme what a breath of fresh air in the wake of the largely dour infinity war,4
9584,in the end the film is a build-up to the tour de force that is avengers,4
9585,iron man 3 is more of the same in the next movie,4
9586,tony stark is actually more than just the surface of these characters,4
9587,9 17 16 this is a very fun and enjoyable,4
9588,more fun than the first film avengers age of ultron was a letdown,4
9589,and the whole thing wraps up with one of the best marvel comics adaptation ever made,4
9590,the plot is pretty simple and the movie is also setting up the larger marvel universe that includes s,4
9591,the very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this is going to be let loose,4
9592,they did mess with who yellow jacket is in the comics where sheâs pretty much a god,4
9593,i personally liked it better than most people,4
9594,this third installment of the iron man trilogy is probably one of the most recognisable studios today,4
9595,a bit overrated but a great film can't wait for 3 to come out,4
9596,tony stark is an enormous douchebag but that's what make it great it's not flawless,4
9597,for its time one of the best comic book movie of 2015,4
9598,as with most marvel movies black panther is a solid superhero blockbuster and another hit for ryan coogler,4
9599,a great moral compass drives this film to be darker than the first one slightly,4
9600,smart humorous and enjoyable iron man is a real respected superhero of mine,4
9601,and of course i would be in remiss if i didn't give it all the stars,4
9602,was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this from a lot of my friends,4
9603,great movie with the perfect amount of humor and it was just a fun movie,4
9604,not quite as good as the 1st one and it may not be iron man but i enjoyed what i saw,4
9605,awesome one of the best origin stories and one of the best movies of the year,4
9606,few would argue that marvel hired quite possibly the best person to play spiderman that i have seen,4
9607,this one is just as good as the avengers 2012,4
9608,jon favreau not only set the standard for marvel movies going forward,4
9609,think of this as the worst of the worst that can happen to him,4
9610,r owns the role of iron man i could not imagine a better job being done with the ants,4
9611,fantastic comedy great action and some top humour,4
9612,with so many characters there's a lot more to the story,4
9613,the story ins't really all that special but it's the strong performances and characters that make the film that much better,4
9614,it is hilarious action packed and has great characters to make this one of the best of the marvel films in the past,4
9615,it's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence followed by a sequence,4
9616,i was not a fan of the marvel movies revolving around the avenger super heroes,4
9617,the director of the movie did a good job screenwriting and acting in this movie,4
9618,one of the better films in the marvel cinematic universe and it doesn't skip a beat,4
9619,you can't even really say anything about this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would,4
9620,3d effects were on point look forward to the sequel when spideys powers really come to the fore,4
9621,and then there's the lynchpin to the whole movie and the twist at the end,4
9622,chris pratt peter quill star-lord was a perfect casting choice and the rest of the movie other 2,4
9623,james gunn delivered a fun action packed superhero movie with a great cast,4
9624,i was not a huge fan of the first one and it's all the better for a good cameo from tony stark et al,4
9625,i really really like this movie and think that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
9626,the casting was great for this film and bearable anticipation for the next one,4
9627,i enjoyed this movie better than the first,4
9628,it has awesome action the acting is awesome the story isnt deep and masterful but its entertaining,4
9629,very entertaining with solid performances and an action spectacle finale,4
9630,of course this was a great comicbook movie,4
9631,you should watch this movie and take notes on how to make a superhero movie with elegance and charisma,4
9632,this was a really fun and entertaining movie,4
9633,but that's about it which is not what i look for in a movie and i think pena did it brilliantly,4
9634,great job marvel and i can't wait for the next avengers film,4
9635,iron man 3 is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
9636,as would be expected the action scenes are also fresh as well,4
9637,and his incomparable portrayal of tony stark is portrayed brilliantly by robert downey jr,4
9638,director jon favreau has both iron man and the world is in peace,4
9639,he has impressed me with most of what he has become and what he can become,4
9640,a perfect cast great graphics relatively small scale of the film and i can't wait to see it,4
9641,black market dealer walt goggins and super villain ghost hannah john-kamen is a menace for them and they have to overcome themselves,4
9642,awesome one of the best comic book movies i've seen in the past to this date and robert downey jr,4
9643,director jon favreau gives us one of the most creatively done end credits i've ever seen,4
9644,interesting characters talented actors good special effects a lot of good moments and development with the characters to still keep us entertained,4
9645,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is nice and great effects,4
9646,after their victory in the first film and works on establishing his role in the marvel universe,4
9647,this was way better than the first avengers,4
9648,hulk vs hulkbuster iron man is by far the best spiderman movie since sam ramis part 2,4
9649,in my opinion this is one of the best movies marvel studios has had to offer,4
9650,tom holland is already my favorite spider-man actor amp adaptation thus far,4
9651,the marvel films leading up to this may's the avengers,4
9652,had me on the edge of your seat,4
9653,2 is a fun time that can be enjoyed by anyone who happens by,4
9654,this is pretty much my favorite marvel movie but it was just a new spin on what they did with it,4
9655,it was bigger and better than ever but the story and visuals made up for it easily,4
9656,it was all right i don't think this film would be as successful if it wasn't for iron man 1,4
9657,shane black comes in to co-write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail,4
9658,marvel keeps pumping out superhero movies and iron man 3 is my personal favourite of the trilogy,4
9659,fun marvel movie that doesn't and didn't have as much heart in it as the first hulk movie,4
9660,my only flaw with this film is that it doesn't waste time setting up an origin story but he definitely needed more,4
9661,overall it was a great movie that started a wonderful franchise the marvel cinematic universe as a whole,4
9662,an impressive step up from what was already one of my favorite super hero films of all time,4
9663,still i think there was still more potential the film could have also given us more of thanos,4
9664,and finally after you know whose death we get to see him reprise his role as the gun-slinging raccoon rocket,4
9665,8 10 points go to the acting category,4
9666,but is it a great addition to the mcu but it still offers a fun story a great performance from michael b,4
9667,iron man 3 was a lot of things but i really think this is my favorite mcu film to date,4
9668,diverging from the source material aside iron man 3 is an immensely satisfying movie that is sure to dazzle and amaze,4
9669,iron man 3 is a great sequel and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
9670,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and it's even better taken as part of the franchise,4
9671,thanks to a great performance by paul rudd,4
9672,great way to start off phase 2 of the mcu is iron man 3 the first summer blockbuster of 2013,4
9673,evangeline lilly as the wasp was very amusing with its writing,4
9674,iron man 3 is a film that is bursting at its seams with charm,4
9675,i know i am in a minority but i think this is the most personal iron man film to date,4
9676,sorry blade sorry steel i love ya both but when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind,4
9677,he almost seem condescending and it's a good summer movie it's so charming,4
9678,guardians of the galaxy is definitely a full-of-heart script gunn and nicole perlman and a visually dazzling splendor,4
9679,my favorite one out of all the disposable villains in the mcu if only for downey's incredible performance,4
9680,we don't know anything about these characters but after seeing the movie again i came to like his character,4
9681,phenomenal this by far is one of the best marvel superhero movies,4
9682,the characters are interesting and complex the action scenes are great as well and they are a lot better than the 1st,4
9683,this movie was the pacing because it built up certain characters and the plot lines but it's still great,4
9684,speaking of the superb cast coogler cast one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94 %,4
9685,the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is nice and great effects,4
9686,some of the lines in this movie had me hooked from stark to finish,4
9687,this was a great start and one of marvel's most underrated films to date,4
9688,a lot of great lines to keep us entertained even when the film isn't as fresh as it could have been,4
9689,to me the focus of the movie was a bit heavy on violence,4
9690,tom holland also shines as spider-man and they did it with style,4
9691,the only thing i didn't like the first one but still a hell of a ride,4
9692,great movie and end to phase two and i can't wait to see the people of wakanda in action in avengers infinity war,4
9693,by entering and returning from the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
9694,most people told me it was the best action in a really chilled out manner,4
9695,this is one of the best movies i've ever seen and definitely one of the most highly anticipated movies ever,4
9696,the film's theme track is the highlight of the movie wasn't very serious,4
9697,pleasantly surprised that this film was as good as it was was casting michael keaton as a blue collar turned villain,4
9698,spider-man homecoming is a very authentic take on the spider-man film shouldn't be as concerned with that,4
9699,the introduction of paul rudd's ant-man is a great movie,4
9700,it features tom holland as peter parker spider-man he definitely captured the essence of this character beautifully,4
9701,i really thought that this was gon na be tuff to beat the first avenger movie and i was never bored with it,4
9702,it could have been a bit predictable the rest of the cast is pretty boring,4
9703,on the one hand you have this super hero movie it's just so fun and i don't mean aliens with creepy appearences,4
9704,the most exciting part for me is the punch up writing,4
9705,faster bigger and funnier than the first it was a fun journey while it lasted,4
9706,the film is a lot fun but it is not the best thing ever but i guess it was ok,4
9707,this is widely considered one of the lesser mcu installments but i can't not mention how utterly corny and conventional it all is,4
9708,i was absolutely pumped for this movie like age of ultron jon favreau's directing style definitely more than makes up for it,4
9709,iron man 3 is a solid sequel that's extremely entertaining,4
9710,one of the longest and most intense fight scenes out of all the iron man movies are all very good,4
9711,and let's just get this out of the way in the opening credits,4
9712,after having grown weary of these comic book movies because this changed the game,4
9713,the plot is not as dark or good as the first and third films in franchise,4
9714,an excellent film to introduce the marvel cinematic universe it's also one of the best superhero films of the 21st century,4
9715,visually striking fueled by action and undeniably hilarious guardians of the galaxy is first-class grade-a space adventure comedy,4
9716,jon favreau has crafted a great movie and a must see,4
9717,it's also one of the best comic book films i've ever seen also being faithful to the source material,4
9718,what i love about this film is are they going to top that with the next movie,4
9719,i think things one of the most relatable and realistic teenage superhero i have ever seen but still funny,4
9720,ant man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the ongoing marvel cinematic universe,4
9721,while most of the members of the avengers have had their own movies in a shared universe they rebooted the hulk,4
9722,what i like i really liked ant-man and the wasp never feels bloated or too hyperkinetic,4
9723,the third-best mcu movie the avengers is a marvel movie done right,4
9724,this film does remind me of star wars infact i think this film is ushering in a new age of superheroes,4
9725,it has a personal significance that i will not be able to live up to expectations but it sure tried its best to,4
9726,iron man 3 ends the iron man trilogy is probably one of my favorite comic book films,4
9727,most people told me it was the best marvel film yet and downey jr makes a charismatic lead,4
9728,spider-man it's nice to see a return to form for the web slinger,4
9729,otherwise i thought it was going to be a short review because over all although it's not a ton,4
9730,the avengers was as close to perfect as possible for a superhero movie that even non-comics fans to appreciate,4
9731,but not the best the marvel universe has seen up to this point,4
9732,somehow it's the get out of marvel studios but one of the best marvel cinematic universe film collection,4
9733,i think the second is better but this one is a lot of fun,4
9734,and that's why i give avengers age of ultron is an exceptionally made film with a good scene of humor,4
9735,in the comics now it's been a long time since i have seen michael keaton in an enjoyable movie,4
9736,however the third act is everything when it comes to playing iron man,4
9737,the visual effects is a little chopper and the story was good still i give this one 4,4
9738,this is maybe the most intense iron man film i've seen and it is one of the funniest movies in the mcu so far,4
9739,i also like jeff the dude bridges as the movie's storyline can be easily predicted,4
9740,an extremely fun flick with great characters and a few laughs,4
9741,a good movie but i look forward to the next installment,4
9742,bp was everything i wanted in a superhero film to date and i highly disagree,4
9743,other standouts include chadwick boseman as the title hero out for redemption in the most unlikely of places,4
9744,i still think the original spider-man story we have all deserved,4
9745,the mandarin plot twist can go fuck itself but i still really like it and robert downey jr is hilarious as always,4
9746,funny relatable and small scale our friendly neighborhood spider-man through a well done performance,4
9747,not a perfect movie but without a doubt the perfect way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale,4
9748,my biggest problem with this movie is the war machine actor,4
9749,you can't even really say anything about this movie but if you have a story worth telling and black panther proves that statement tenfold,4
9750,black panther is a great stand alone film and it's a strong internal hatred which comes to him organically,4
9751,i thought the first one wasn't worst then the first one it was a great opening to a great franchise,4
9752,who would have guessed that a movie that featured a talking tree and a raccoon are our hero's now,4
9753,there was no real proper build up to it and it was worth the entire experience,4
9754,this is still a worthy follow-up and a pretty good addition to the universe for sure,4
9755,a pretty satisfying sequel to the first iron man film maybe even better,4
9756,holland excels and keaton chills in a modernized addition to the marvel universe soundtrack was amazing lol and groot,4
9757,the brazil chase scene was fun but the part in the movie that were so off that it detracted from the film a bit,4
9758,the cast was great and it was a pleasure seeing all these heroes come together for an action-packed and creative space opera,4
9759,if you don't know what was going on,4
9760,puts heart and soul into an already enjoyable series though some of the effects could use some work,4
9761,this is the best marvel film to date,4
9762,my only problem the relatability in this movie is really fun to watch,4
9763,it might not be as pretty as the first but a more than deserving sequel,4
9764,the problems that i had with this movie was the end fight scene is a bit underwhelming,4
9765,but i think that this is one of the better new marvel movies,4
9766,his chemistry with gwyneth paltrow which just gives you all the thrills that you expect from superhero movie,4
9767,this is my second favorite movie in the marvel cinematic universe with heart action and consequences,4
9768,this movie may have one of the best and most unique in the mcu,4
9769,maybe if he made one interaction with ultron i would have liked just maybe a few more jokes,4
9770,i admit that the film does lack an origin story but instead developing the character into the hero we all love,4
9771,joss hulk lets you forgive and forget about the other hulk movies but this one was pretty great,4
9772,through this spider-man is great,4
9773,2 10 it's a must see for anyone in the galaxy,4
9774,liked it a lot for me it was a very enjoyable movie and well worth the time and money,4
9775,his backstory seen in the opening of the film and i found myself checking my watch,4
9776,but even in 2d the film is a fantastic presentation of the iron man comics i actually enjoyed the mandarin twist,4
9777,there's no arguing that this was the worst mcu film in 2018,4
9778,despite a weak third act avengers age of ultron still manages to entertain and deliver exactly what audiences may have expected,4
9779,the only problem i have with the movie is that it has like 10 main characters and every one of them,4
9780,the main thing i love however is that it's a good change from the same old superhero,4
9781,pym who can be tough to swallow in the comics and does so with flashy style excellent acting and top notch rock solid storytelling,4
9782,she doesn't do anything villainous in the entire movie and that was extremely upsetting,4
9783,it was pretty good but i liked the first flick better but it's a great reboot to the character overall,4
9784,amazing for me hits the perfect balance between action and characters and a worthy followup to the first,4
9785,i really really like this movie and think that this is the threat the avengers are facing against,4
9786,only three years after the last spider-man movie to date and one of the best spider-man movies,4
9787,i actually surprisingly really liked this movie and i can,4
9788,is one of my favorite movies in the marvel cinematic universe has become increasingly known for,4
9789,still very great movie but not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect,4
9790,ant-man doesn't reinvent the wheel but overall it's a good change from the same old superhero,4
9791,filled with fantastic visuals funny moments and a butt load of action,4
9792,fun time another good addition to the cast in the role of m'baku man-ape the leader of wakanda's mountain tribe,4
9793,wasn't the best marvel movie full stop,4
9794,which i guess means it was pretty good but i liked the direction it was going with his character,4
9795,his back story could have been given more information about the quantum realm that may play a big part in the mcu,4
9796,these types of films are meant to be fun and the visuals are spectacular,4
9797,great movie packed with action and humour just what you would expect from spidey but it still doesn't take away from anything,4
9798,this movie just didnt have the same originality and impact as the first one,4
9799,is his sarcastic self and the action is amazing the visual effects are as incredibly crafted as it's characters and storyline,4
9800,having taken a plea deal two years after the events of civil war and infinity war,4
9801,homecoming is a really fun and cool film,4
9802,one of marvel's more marginal characters but they have an excellent script and great performances from edward norton and william hurt,4
9803,probably one of the best superhero films of the 21st century created a striking powerful and exciting movie,4
9804,it adds depth to obvious characters and the action scenes felt significant and filled with emotion not just mindless visual nonsense,4
9805,iron man 2 doesn't disappoint but it doesn't hurt the film too much,4
9806,but because the emotional weight on thanos's side of the story rocket yandu baby groot make their escape from the captivity,4
9807,post-battle-of-new-york ptsd stark teams up with unlikely allies in order to solve the problem,4
9808,but peyton reed does an admirable job of such explication,4
9809,captain america first avenger was good but not as good as the first iron man suit,4
9810,it's got stunning visuals a great cast and a great story make black panther a great movie,4
9811,if you are looking for witty web slinging action then spider-man homecoming is that it does not feel one sided,4
9812,some critics say there is perhaps a little too much in terms of suspension of disbelief,4
9813,i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man was quite a treat during its theatrical release,4
9814,overall this is easily one of the best marvel movies it's always fun to spot stan lee,4
9815,ed norton is perfect in the title role,4
9816,hank pym but it also manages to deliver a witty and comical script,4
9817,the third act is everything when it comes to enjoying a movie it is executed so well,4
9818,ultimately it can't quite live up to the first one somehow but still great fun,4
9819,nice addition to the marvel universe at large,4
9820,and that's also where you'd be wrong iron man isn't strong the 2nd time around,4
9821,you honestly feel for tony a lot more in this film and there's also some great action sequences,4
9822,and so we get the essence of what spider-man is good but it is not a bad part of the film,4
9823,now the 2008 film is set in the marvel universe but i'm glad they do,4
9824,the writing is much better and it's not too big here is the villian loki,4
9825,if the female characters were less one-dimensional it would have been clear not to anticipate the film,4
9826,it also has some of the most memorable movies in marvel's entire library,4
9827,awesome action sequences a detestable villain everything you'd ever want in a comic book movie done right,4
9828,iron-man captain america thor hulk etc,4
9829,the actors seemed to be having a lot of plot holes and cgi battling robots,4
9830,with great action scenes and a good mystery,4
9831,not the best ironman movie but it was pretty easy for me to tell what was going on,4
9832,if it fails beyond this so be it tom holland does a great job with things like the shots of ant-man,4
9833,not as good as the first one but i can't figure out why,4
9834,what impressed me the most about the movie was that the main villain was kind of stale,4
9835,yes i know that the aspect of spider-man is just as fun and awesome and weird as you have hoped,4
9836,it turned out to be a great film,4
9837,it is not as good as avengers 1 but close,4
9838,but if nothing else avengers age of ultron ultimately marks the beginning of the movie feels awkward and kind of disjointed in a way,4
9839,i was not expecting i'd rather want a spider-man film mostly focuses around spider-man trying to be peter parker,4
9840,78%iron man 2 has all the thrills and humour you know expect from a marvel movie ever,4
9841,almost as good as the first but i still loved it,4
9842,my only problem the relatability in this movie is way better in my opinion,4
9843,great fun and a genuinely great movie but there is a few things missing on here and i don't mean aliens with creepy appearences,4
9844,they have to work well together be likable and they have to fight with her she is a good character,4
9845,the movie was funny at the right times and the action can be uninteresting but overall fits nicely into the marvel franchise,4
9846,what can i say you always amaze the audience from start to finish this movie had good pace and really did flow quite well,4
9847,this is really the essence of the original from the comics,4
9848,probably the best spider-man villain since doc ock in sm 2 and he made the movie,4
9849,homecoming is the best spider-man movie that everyone has been waiting for,4
9850,everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job directing this film and even has a part in it as usual,4
9851,a bit long of a stretch but it's a damn fun movie to say the least,4
9852,the movie ties in perfectly with all of the other studios can just close their doors,4
9853,i also would have liked more of the quantum realm and bring janet home,4
9854,and of course i would be in remiss if i did not have netflix i would probably buy,4
9855,the villain was different this time around i liked it but it was not exactly what most viewers and critics wanted out of the series,4
9856,when genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
9857,a very solid superhero film iron man is the year's best when all done,4
9858,the film is only let down by a lack of focus and weak villains,4
9859,nothing is going to be a dark and brooding flick but it was a better movie that avengers ii age of ultron,4
9860,incredible just like the first film and works on establishing his role in the marvel universe tests their mettle against thanos and his black order,4
9861,a departure from the more serious films in the marvel cinematic universe movies in one gigantic event is no small feat,4
9862,i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and comedy sequences in this movie are stunning and beautiful,4
9863,jon watts gives us a reboot that is just as good as the original spider-man films ever made,4
9864,what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the film's large cast and battle sequences,4
9865,i recommend it for a few hours but this is one of the best movies from marvel,4
9866,liv tyler as betty ross is very good and i love the dynamic with iron man,4
9867,i've waited for this movie for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes in the universe,4
9868,gives an outstanding performance as tony stark and is without a doubt one of the best action movies but it tanks in act 3,4
9869,i don't know if he's as amazing as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
9870,the ending was the best part of the film and not over-shadowed by the others,4
9871,every single time he's on screen its just i felt like he relied on too much technology which i was not fan of,4
9872,great story great action great things make a good superhero movie but boy was i wrong,4
9873,the twist in the story was great and the story was compelling,4
9874,as for the actual film the beginning of the movie of how the guardians came together etc,4
9875,after getting over it and rewatching the movie a few times iron man 3 is now the best third marvel movie ever made,4
9876,also unlike most of the other parts of the movie and the weapon effects,4
9877,this time around he is actually in the movie but the best part is still when captain america introduces himself to groot,4
9878,while the villain in the movie is probably one of my favorite comic book film's,4
9879,volume 2 is a good continuation of the first movie that he is iron man,4
9880,one of the better mcu films only thing that i really didn't think it could get better but it did,4
9881,the ageless boseman is at his best here and the action has a good physical feel that makes it exciting,4
9882,refreshing fun brilliantly written and brilliantly acted this is the best marvel movie but i't up there,4
9883,92 % not only is guardians of the galaxy is one of the best demonstrations of hollywood redemption,4
9884,marvel seems to know exactly what they want and i can't wait until the sequel comes out,4
9885,but beware you should know the other marvel movies of late and that's not something i'd ever thought i would,4
9886,marvel can do no wrong but really it's hard to compete with the first one,4
9887,one of the best superhero films that i have ever seen in a spider man movie,4
9888,this is definitely a reference to the comics as i'm here to see a good movie,4
9889,i would also consider this a comedy just as much as if it was one of the best superhero films totally worth your time,4
9890,the film is goin to end and i was waiting for this film to avoid being a mediocre one,4
9891,a marked improvement over ang lee's hulk but the incredible hulk is a satisfying comic book movie,4
9892,lilly gets to come into her own as the wasp and we want to see more black widow,4
9893,not as good as the first one but that's a relatively big one and something that i keep revisiting,4
9894,everyone of the characters no matter how obscure and turn them into a great movie and started the whole cinematic universe very nicely,4
9895,fantastic movie good balance for all the characters the focus is more aimed at captain america and iron man 2,4
9896,infinity war represents the culmination of the first three phrases of the mcu and a good spider-man film to date,4
9897,i enjoyed this movie immensely it was full of plenty of action and humor,4
9898,overall the incredible hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
9899,and i loved seeing edward norton as bruce banner and tim roth as the villainous emil blonsky,4
9900,the ending was shocking but i still liked the first one better,4
9901,sounded a lot better in this movie than the first antman,4
9902,iron man 3 is arguably the best film in the iron man series tony stark iron man is unlikable,4
9903,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore,4
9904,all together black panther is a solid superhero film and has really set the stage for possibly the biggest movie universe in cinematic history,4
9905,probably the best iron man movie there is action packed and quite a few issues after that trailer and i was a shellhead,4
9906,after all the memes of people fading away into odd triangles and i don't personally think they handled yellow jacket that poorly,4
9907,the acting is top-tier from everyone in the movie looked liked they had a fun time making it,4
9908,this movie has some unnecessary scenes and sequences it was nice to finally see hulkbuster in film,4
9909,it took risks i didn't expect this to be that great,4
9910,as a reluctant king you can really feel how peter is feeling and overall it is one of the most fun movies ever produced,4
9911,the only notable flaw i find here is with the villain but i will address that in greater detail further along,4
9912,score 9supporting cast the rest of the marvel universe and enjoyable for fans and others alike,4
9913,gwyneth paltrow embraces the drama of iron man 2 if you haven't seen it put it on your list,4
9914,tom hollands gifts us with a great performance from robert downey jr,4
9915,a very solid superhero film iron man is the well-told birth of a marvel icon and relaunching downeys carrer,4
9916,this movie is still a solid superhero movie that made me think of the original star wars,4
9917,in conclusion iron man was a huge moment for long time fans of the marvel universe,4
9918,i left the theater immediately wanting to see it again to see if it gets better the second time around,4
9919,leading the way again black panther is one of the most surprisingly funny movies in recent memories,4
9920,many shots from the trailer isnt in the movie the futuristic african vibe was really cool and well adapted on screen,4
9921,but it does deal very well with the effects of ptsd following the events in the avengers,4
9922,this is a good movie but i still prefer the avengers or the first iron man,4
9923,it was just a great movie and robert downey jr,4
9924,however if you like sci fi but are not a marvel fan i think you will find this film quite enjoyable,4
9925,my highlight of the movie thats not to say that this film is a literate epic makes my favourite marvel film,4
9926,it has a great villain great visuals great performances and a mix of humour awesome action and pleasant retro soundtrack,4
9927,couldn't they just put it at the end of the first movie that he is iron man,4
9928,i love how the backstory was in the opening credits so there is more time for smashing,4
9929,the classic flawed yet charming character scott lang is under house arrest after the events of infinity war,4
9930,the characters and not just the members of the avengers in one film,4
9931,review in a nutshell iron man 3 is another great marvel movie,4
9932,you are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand was a treat as usual,4
9933,ultimately a great movie that builds upon the iron man series tony stark iron man,4
9934,but it seems that black panther is a breath of fresh air the mcu needed,4
9935,i loved the parade of end credit scenes and they didn't seem capable of handling a good superhero movie and this has it all,4
9936,i wished for more development of the quantum realm and tried so hard to not go subatomic,4
9937,the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies about one of those superheroes,4
9938,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the whole family,4
9939,a great follow-up to one of the best 3rd acts ever,4
9940,ultron is a great time at movies with a really charismatic and funny leading man,4
9941,a sequel that delivers everything that made the first one an instant classic,4
9942,the action has some issues and there are some unique aspects to the action scenes,4
9943,you have not seen it then go see it you will enjoy it,4
9944,it's a film that really deserves it,4
9945,the cast led by chris pratt is once again great all of the characters immensely great second story and fabulous fx,4
9946,2 is not as fun as the first one not by a long shot,4
9947,story was pretty light-weight but it is fun for the comic book fans references to captain america which was an awesome tie in,4
9948,as well as connecting him to nick fury for the sake of the iron man trilogy even if some elements are not satisfying,4
9949,the action is spectacular the acting very well done and served as vibrant shows of african culture,4
9950,i really liked the characters but i feel like there could have been,4
9951,what an amazing way to make a movie about a shrinking growing superhero who talks to ants,4
9952,i think warmonger is actually one of the best spider-man movie and of course disney was going to kill it,4
9953,i loved that they introduce 3 new characters in this movie and this movie is fucking great,4
9954,now if that doesn't make it bad,4
9955,what an amazing way to make a movie about a group of heroes that almost nobody knows,4
9956,and all the others but it's more of just a sequence followed by a sequence,4
9957,another quality that was seen in this film is the best comedy of 2015,4
9958,not as good as the first one but as always hilarious and amazing,4
9959,the credit rests in a lot of things in this universe,4
9960,didn't realise how good this film was the first in the marvel cinematic universe,4
9961,the film also boasts killer soundtrack just like the first film and reboots the rest for a better cinematic experience,4
9962,this i admit was a great launch to the marvel cinematic universe not quite like the first one is excellent,4
9963,his purpose for wishing to take down the hulk but with disastrous consequences,4
9964,the plot was thoroughly entertaining even if it might be too michael bay,4
9965,a typical filler when it comes to playing iron man,4
9966,as a comic book reader and a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some,4
9967,the writing and pacing are very tight as well and the final product of the set up turns out to be highly enjoyable,4
9968,as a comic book reader and a comic book movie that's overtly political,4
9969,a great addition to the ever expanding mcu,4
9970,i can not explain how the story was amazing and the abomination idea was awesome,4
9971,the best out of the three even if the plot twist will anger comic book fans,4
9972,it's a great movie but not as good as the first one but it does set the stage for a great mcu,4
9973,one thing i really appreciate in ant-man and the wasp is a fun summer popcorn movie,4
9974,mickey rourke's ivan vanko is a little weak on the villain but that didn't stop us from enjoying the movie,4
9975,iron man didn't have to go to the theater and have some fun with some unashamed disregard towards personal responsibility along the way,4
9976,being the guardians of the galaxy in which they could have done a better job of portraying a good ai gone bad,4
9977,i still preferred the dark knight rises and the amazing spider-man and dropped us right in the action,4
9978,i cant wait to see what joss has in store for the avengers and guardians when it comes down to melee fighting,4
9979,guardians of the galaxy and captian america the winter soldier and only had 30 seconds in the movie,4
9980,not bad for a culmination of 10 years worth of build up and demonstrates a new trend in movie franchises,4
9981,although i and probably nobody had heard of ant-man is one who is not good at being spiderman yet,4
9982,there are only two characters from other mcu films and somehow other spider-man movies this origin story for iron man robert downey jr,4
9983,perfect casting for stark it's nice to see a spider-man film after only the original 2,4
9984,a very good sequel but maybe not as good as the first but the substance is what counts,4
9985,this movie made me even more excited to see paul rudd in a superhero role but he works well for this one,4
9986,i thought ed norton did a great job at making you hate him especially towards the end,4
9987,in a rush to get stark the iron man suit it is pure perfection,4
9988,ronin is a horrible villain and one of the best climaxes of the mcu,4
9989,i enjoyed the avengers and with avengers age of ultron is not that bad but it is unnecessarily messy,4
9990,he is an experienced writer but when it came to a cohesive long-running cinematic universe,4
9991,didn't realise how good this film was thes t,4
9992,very enjoyable characters were great overall definitely worth seeing on the big screen over the past fifteen years the character really needs no further introduction,4
9993,the villain played by jeff bridges still remains as one of the greatest fight scenes ever committed to film,4
9994,tony stark is absolutely perfect in this role,4
9995,i actually enjoyed this even more than the first and that's saying a lot right there,4
9996,jon favreau compiled a good story with some really good jokes and dialogue throughout,4
9997,spider-man homecoming is a decent spider-man movie since spider-man en 2002,4
9998,though it can't recapture the same magic as the first film but that doesn't mean he does anything wrong whatsoever,4
9999,this is the best film of all the films the question was could such an ambitious feat succeed,4
