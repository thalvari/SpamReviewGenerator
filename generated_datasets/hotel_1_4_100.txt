the receptionist who check us in was very sweet and friendly. on top of that i could not get my money back. the people out there being extremly loud till about 1 45 in the morning heard gurgling sounds from the bathroom. hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot in full view of the office. the air conditioning didn't work and the front desk person was heavenly though so nice. the fact that you had to take the spread off. needless to say we locked ourselves in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. the tub was so bad that i booked 2 nights at sheraton hotel for business meetings. we needed separate beds and the room we were assigned should not have been in use. the door jamb was completely rusted and the door did not lock the rooms smelled like smoke. other room clock broken tub took 30 minutes to even get checked in. only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to skip it and start with the second step. unless you can get a west facing room it's going to fall and hurt someone because it's so rotted. upon entering the bathroom there were dead bugs on the floor the bed was unmade trash was not emptied etc. the room was tiny and the front desk staff was extremely nice as well. we got there didn't look like a cyclist no. the management recommended that my companion and i go to the room which had already been paid through my credit card. during my stay i broke out with bug bites all over 12 in just my left arm. we were planning on staying 3 nights but left and will never go back and i would spend the extra 10 for a motel 6. breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort. also the pool was empty and looked as if it had a decent amount of value. we returned hours later around 10 pm and the driver will take us. when i got there the attendant could not find my rsvp and my room was switched twice. we booked because it said complimentary breakfast but come to find out do not use their towels. i have stayed here about 20 times and this was the worst hotel room and hotel i've ever stayed in. i had to check out of the room. the cleanliness was lacking i lifted the toilet seat and there was hair and blood splatter on the toilet. we agreed but made it clear that we wanted to view the room before checking in. when i called the front desk from my cell phone to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well. so for two nights we had no tv remote control in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't cancel it. the 1st room i got had no air conditioning and the bathroom was moldy throughout. the smell in the room was very dirty. the mgr put me in another room that had double beds. the resort itself was very nice and quickly move me to another room it was about the same. i called down to the front desk to let them know and the guy was completely rude and disrespectful. i was told to come back the next day to not go in our room but my mothers room across the hall. the front desk girl by the name of prite was very rude and disrespectful. we thought that the room was used before. from the valet to the front desk they said that there was a 45 minute wait. i arrived to find out that the hotel didn't have a working tv. after discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower as each room had one unbelievable issue after another. we were never able to find the other hotel so we had to shower in a couple inches of water. it served its purpose as a place to stay so i have to deal with it. com reservation said it was a great view of santana row. breakfast eggs have cheese and i do not recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort. room filthy first room we couldn't stay after the first night because of the conditions of the rooms or clean the mold build up. i had reservations for 2 nights and left a day early from marathon due to this facility. we informed staff but there were no other rooms available room was disgustingly filthy. it was horrible i got in room and the staff was very helpful but not helpful enough. they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands. the hotel was cheap and close to the beach and grocery store this was my worst experience ever. they say oh we didn't see her wash her hands. the hotel appears to be in the middle of reno or just decided to quit on it. all 3 rooms were dirty half of the lights did not work there were hanging wires where the smoke detector should be. well the next day we found out that the swimming pool was on the small size but clean. called back and the front desk woman was rude. i had to wait for it to be turned on. so much so that we didn't mess anything up in the few minutes we were there and more interested in his phone. i never felt safe in this hotel it was extremely dirty. crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building where there was chairs and countless empty beer bottles laying. went on a long motorcycle ride and just wanted to find a place to lay your head with no cares this could be it. com but nonetheless we're glad we left and found a holiday inn express that i knew i would never stay here again. the shower was broken the room wasn't non refundable i would have walked out during check-in. she told me we couldn't check in until after 3 pm. i was assured by the very pleasant front desk staff that my room was paid for hotel released it upon complaint. however there is no excuse for a room that was in very poor condition. will not stay at this hotel again and no swimming pool. overall we did not have a screen and would not lock the bed was hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible. we were told we couldn't get to mobile until late. the one thing we asked for and didn't get seated until 10 35pm. on a ten day trip this was the second worst hotel experience ever. i spent three nights at this hotel but i did expect more than what we experienced. my husband arrived late i'd called in advance to let them know we were in town for a function and on a tight schedule. 00 per night for my dog to stay with us and there was a small refrigerator to store our wine. i asked about changing rooms and was told they would not do anything about it. view moreent rental 6k instead of 250 as promised we were told there was no manager available so. when i complain to the front desk and they never fixed it. we came here and ask that they don't even tend to the room each day. the room we stayed at looked nothing like the motel 6 style room we walked into. one had no drapes and despite our numerous attempts to get some they gave me two hand towels and apologized. this was by far the worst i have ever had lot of weird people on drugs hanging outside in parking lot. they had no one available to look at it they already had it on the bedroom. elevator was broken and i had to put up with this noise. we got to the hotel the guy at desk said that the rooms were sold out but during i stayed there for 4 days. i would never recommend anyone to stay there even as a last resort should you ever stay here. i will not be staying at this hotel the same nights. the room was old but clean and the bed was like sleeping on the floor would have been more comfortable in a motel 6. i had booked for two days couldn't get out of there i didn't stop to take pictures. there were big rough looking guys lingering at the front door and a rat at the back. it was so bad that there was no coffee before the 7a. finally a man walked out of a door right next to the lake which is what we were looking for. the room we were given but they wouldn't do it so why do you expect your customers to do it. carpet in the room was peeling off the door frame was coming apart from the wall. this was a just down the street from the 1 2 price ticket kiosk and tourist information. same thing happened to my kids in the pool from the steam. we stayed in elko for one night to catch an early flight. the most uncomfortable beds you can think of i can say something bad about. the only reason i use this hotel for is hookups. there were splatter stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in the lobby. not satisfied the toilet out a loud squeel they wouldn't do anything about it and would not speech to him
