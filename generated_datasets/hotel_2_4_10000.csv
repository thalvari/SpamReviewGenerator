4,there was also a note on the front desk for that on the second day,2
5,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay but we won't return,2
6,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
7,the room was small and old and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were flat,2

9,sadly we paid top dollar for a room with a jet tub and we had to carry,2
10,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for another night but was moved to a different room,2
11,unfortunately our bed was extremely uncomfortable the hot tub didn't work then when they fix it only 2 jets worked,2
12,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
13,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
14,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff were very rude,2
15,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
16,the general condition of the hotel was drab,2
17,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
18,if you just need a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
19,location is okay but the hotel itself is clean and looks nice,2
20,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
21,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
22,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
23,place is a s t hole but if your looking for okay rates and just need a bed,2
24,i was in the room next door tv until 3 am,2
25,the hotel was clean but very run down,2
26,the staff was friendly and the room was very nice however the walls were very thin,2

28,i actually found a used washcloth on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
29,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
30,my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
31,during check out the clerk was sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
32,took a shower walked on the floor and it did not work there either,2
33,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i walked upstairs to drop our bags before heading to the lake,2
34,we asked for an immediate move to another room and the mattress there was a little better,2
35,staff was friendly and the room was kind of gross,2
36,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed and was told there was not one http www,2
37,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
38,overall next time i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again,2
39,the rooms were not very clean and the room did have an odor,2
40,one room smelled like smoke and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
41,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have pens in the room i was given had no desk,2
42,my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and it was late at night so we did not make arrangements for another room,2
43,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
44,the carpet in the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
45,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the front desk and she was,2
46,the door to the front desk to change rooms and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
47,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
48,also the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not clean,2
49,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
50,it was just a place to sleep this one will do,2
51,needless to say we won't be using them again,2
52,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
53,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
54,the area in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping a low battery beep,2
55,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2

66,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean enough and the furnishings were nice,2
67,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
68,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
69,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
70,location was nice next to the freeway and several fast food places,2
71,this hotel is in a very bad condition,2
72,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
73,a decent cheap place to stay so you don't have a bed for you,2
74,i travel durango frequently and will never stay at a quality inn again,2
75,we chose this hotel because of the price but i have stayed in this hotel sometime last winter,2
76,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
77,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to make several trips to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean,2
78,in the early morning i was trying to get a fork,2
79,there were lots of dead bugs on the carpet and just a feeling that the cleaning crew was not up to par,2
80,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
81,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2

84,i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone i cared about,2
85,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2

89,the door to the room we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
90,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
91,the size of the room was rather dismaying,2

93,walls are thin and you can hear everything going on next door to you,2
94,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
95,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think i got a good nights sleep the entire stay,2
96,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2

120,the pillows definately needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
121,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't clean the room for us,2

164,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were helpful,2

188,the armchair in the room was very small,2
189,this place seems to be worn out and in need of a good update in the general areas,2

191,beds are the smallest doubles i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2

271,i won't be staying at this hotel again and do not plan on recommending it to anyone,2
272,not at all worth the cost of the hotel this was concerning,2
273,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2

278,they apologized and said it would be refunded she said 7-10 days,2
279,room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was a live-in hotel,2
280,unfortunately i don't have to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
281,hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
282,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
283,if i had known they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
284,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
285,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
286,it was my first and last time i will stay here again even though i am a rewards member,2
287,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
288,we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
289,when i tried to get someone from the front desk they had to give us different sign in passwords,2
290,last morning there there was a roach in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door,2
291,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
292,the door to the non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in room so they couldn't use it,2
293,when we first entered the room was okay but could have been cleaner,2
294,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money,2
295,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower there's not much to rave about,2

300,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
301,the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and mold ceiling was split open due to roof leak,2
302,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to sleep and shower,2
303,the ceiling in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there but no reason to roll your eyes at us,2
304,it was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
305,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2
306,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
307,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
308,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel because it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
309,room was outdated but it worked for the purpose just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
310,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was closed for repair,2
311,we stayed at this hotel it was under remodeling and one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
312,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
313,when i told these issues to the front desk but not other beverages,2
314,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast included,2
315,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
316,i am very disappointed that the wifi did not work the last morning the maid did not clean the bathroom well,2
317,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
318,just our luck the late guests made over a dozen trips in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
319,3rd time i have stayed at this hotel,2
320,the me t day the room was not very nice at all,2
321,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute reservation so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
322,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
323,we really never even felt part of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
324,for an extra couple of we could have stayed at the valencia several times but now have had two disappointing visits,2
325,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
326,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
327,was helpful in making a reservation for a king bed and was told we had a room with 2 double beds,2
328,called the front desk were very nice the guy in the next room and there was hair in the tub and on the floor,2
329,i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
330,there were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a small amount of fried rice on the bed spread,2
331,i had to throw the pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
332,looks and acts like they don't want to walk on the carpet barefoot,2
333,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
334,when my husband went to the front desk and they assured us that we would get one,2
335,elevator was broke was told it would be half an hour,2
336,good for simply having a place to sleep for the night,2
337,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
338,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
339,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the kitchen clean,2
340,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
341,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room had dirty comforters and had to be replaced,2
342,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
343,the front desk person was nice but had to wait until 11 pm as our room had not yet been cleaned,2
344,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
345,if we go back up to the desk and have his room switched,2
346,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer,2
347,when i went back to the desk and they said they would put us in another room,2
348,the room was very poor and limited choices,2
349,the room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
350,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one partially used roll of toilet paper,2
351,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing,2
352,folks running the front desk were i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
353,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and i will not recommend to family or friends,2
354,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
355,we asked for a rollaway they said they didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
356,we came back to the same motel if in the area but i did expect more,2
357,the best thing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
358,unfortunately we may not be staying here again and i won't be back here,2
359,also we had to wait for staff to stop playing games on facebook so that i could at least get in my room,2
360,the good news is that the hotel is clean but to noisy for me and the other one for them,2
361,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
362,night one went out for dinner and had to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
363,could hear tv all night in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
364,the room felt clean enough to sleep in but the hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there,2
365,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the concert that was in town that night,2
366,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
367,i called the front desk and request it,2
368,we didn't stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight,2
369,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
370,the doors in the hallways are old and dirty,2
371,we'd stayed at a different hotel midway,2
372,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
373,don't read this if you don't have to drag my with me,2
374,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
375,my wife and i will never stay in another sleep inn,2
376,when you close the door to the hallway and the hotel smelled similar to a hockey locker room,2
377,when talking to the front desk for guests,2
378,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
379,the shower didn't run out of hot water by the time i returned,2
380,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't clean it from the last person,2
381,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
382,the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
383,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
384,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
385,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
386,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
387,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
388,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was staying in an old smelly hospice facilty,2
389,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
390,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
391,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be the only employee around,2
392,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in the disneyland resort you don't even get a mint,2
393,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay tonight's i only stayed one,2
394,i did not feel safe in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
395,upon entering the room part of the hotel and location were good,2
396,we arrived late and the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
397,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
398,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of order,2
399,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here for sure,2
400,when i went in to complain i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
401,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
402,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
403,on the third day the room was not working no channel,2
404,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work at all and in the living room only,2
405,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
406,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of repairs,2
407,i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be 4 based on room facilities and service and good food,2
408,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
409,needless to say we were not happy to see roaches in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
410,the motel is tidy and the room was kind of gross,2
411,we had to ask for towels to take a shower and all that went down,2
412,the door to our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
413,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
414,also the room fan wouldn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
415,we went back to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
416,this is the last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
417,although clean i will not stay there in the futur,2
418,needless to say we will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
419,the hotel was clean but very run down,2
420,if you are staying for a few hours for maintenance,2
421,the room was clean and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
422,since my room was next to the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
423,great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was clean but everything was old and or not very well kept,2
424,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
425,on check out it was noted that you had to go sit in reception,2
426,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
427,they did have free breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach i don't think there was enough staff there,2
428,it also didn't seem like it was in the worst location in the complex except the unfortunate people below us,2
429,there was also a note on the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
430,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
431,our room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room from what i understood,2
432,the first time it didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush,2
433,i called front desk because i didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
434,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
435,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
436,the only thing i can say is that it was close to universal studios,2
437,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
438,this was the worst i have stayed at this hotel for the holiday weekend but my experience left me wanting more,2
439,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
440,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
441,set in lush green mountains the location of this hotel is certainly showing hard bed small bathroom with plumbing issues,2
442,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
443,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
444,and the drunks talking loud and slamming doors at 1 30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
445,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
446,i told him i do not smoke and i have stayed at better motel 6 motels,2
447,considering the price the hotel would have been prepared,2
448,overall if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
449,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is pretty run down,2
450,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean,2
451,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
452,very difficult to get a good night's sleep over all,2
453,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
454,elevator was very slow and struggled felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
455,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though we booked a non smoking room,2
456,when i told these issues to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
457,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of a spooky dirt road in the middle of nowhere,2
458,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two elevators out of commission other elevator slow and unpredictable,2
459,needless to say i am never going to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
460,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was very apologetic and immediately changed the sheets for us,2
461,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
462,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
463,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was nice,2
464,the kitchenette had all cabinets destroyed and the refrigerator did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
465,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
466,toilet seat was soiled and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
467,i had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
468,this time the room smelled of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
469,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel the lobby reeked of smoke though there were no smoking signs posted,2
470,convenient location however if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
471,i told him i do not smoke and i have stayed at this hotel in the future,2
472,our room was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
473,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
474,room was plenty clean but did have a mini fridge as their breakfast is really,2
475,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
476,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower and the shower head was not raised it was chest high,2
477,i have stayed at this hotel before a few years ago in another city,2
478,we are a married couple and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
479,the a c was not turned on and warm,2
480,also the phone in my room did not have a part,2
481,overall it was a clean room and that is just creepy,2
482,i thought it was a hostel but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
483,the positive the location is good for traveling,2
484,a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend this hotel,2
485,this hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
486,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and the bill ended up being over 205,2
487,i was given room facing the street however this room's bathroom had not been cleaned at all between uses,2
488,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
489,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good hotel i will never stay at a dt again,2
490,the best thing about this hotel was positive,2
491,if you need an elevator this is not the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
492,i will not stay at this location never,2
493,although clean i will not stay at this property again,2
494,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the dark,2
495,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
496,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
497,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfy,2
498,will be calling america's best value inn and i've stayed in dozens of hotels,2
499,no good smell in the room the carpet was so nasty,2
500,we had a room with a queen bed and bath and tv,2
501,the motel is tidy and the room was relatively large and clean,2
502,the staff was nice and the breakfast was very basic cereal bread english muffins and waffles,2
503,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back after the cruise i assumed it would be there in a minute,2
504,also the indoor pool was closed for renovation,2
505,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
506,big gap underneath room door easily could see people going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a double,2
507,i wont be staying here again and i won't return,2
508,we told them again and they said they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
509,it works for your needs but for the price and if you are staying for a few hours,2
510,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk told her that they do not know about it,2
511,at least the staff on the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
512,i guess i got what i paid for next time ill spend few more bucks for a more clean room,2
513,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
514,first the good the hotel is a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy,2
515,charged 200 for room since it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
516,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
517,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
518,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
519,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
520,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
521,not very happy with the cleanliness of the carpet in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
522,i called the front desk and told them i would have to go back to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
523,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
524,i was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
525,waffle maker looked like it had been changed,2
526,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
527,she met us on our way back through town much cleaner,2
528,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out in the morning i woke up to 20 worth of spoiled food,2
529,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower there's not much to rave about,2
530,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
531,the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was in the process of replacing room carpets,2
532,i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
533,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
534,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was not,2
535,it also didn't seem like it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
536,i use marriott a lot this is the first time i saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in,2
537,small lobby and no actual front check in desk i noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not good at all,2
538,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
539,the room smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
540,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel weeks in advance for a wrestling tournament with my son,2
541,they charge for parking which i didn't think was possible,2
542,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the time,2
543,cigarette burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bed was broken and did not turn on,2
544,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
545,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
546,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
547,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
548,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower there's not much to rave about,2
549,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
550,this hampton was not as clean as our last visit,2
551,the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't spectacular but could have used a little more tlc,2
552,what makes matters worse is she told me she didn't know and didn't have a reservation,2
553,we booked a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
554,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
555,the room was clean and staff was nice and helpful but the king bed was terrible,2
556,the room was decent for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
557,second problem the shower in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
558,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
559,the wifi didn't work in the room you had to go around to get inside,2
560,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep,2
561,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're looking for the better rate it's fine,2
562,the desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the second floor that was better,2
563,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
564,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
565,front desk reception was friendly and courteous but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
566,i just hate that i had to change rooms twice due to dirty rooms,2
567,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
568,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
569,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not give it more than 2,2
570,tried to go back to the same rental,2
571,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't even get in the pool it was so dirty,2
572,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
573,interupted several times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
574,when i first entered the room was okay for the night,2
575,it was creepy and it was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
576,on a good note the staff was very polite and friendly and efficient,2
577,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
578,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
579,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
580,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the inn used the inn parking lot for parking,2
581,the distance was a big problem and i feel the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
582,small dim musty lobby and the room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
583,drug central i would never stay there again,2
584,we sat in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
585,when we arrived there was no one at the front desk were friendly and helpful,2
586,it did not show that it was an old man smell,2
587,thought it was a cheap hotel with shared bath and toilet but it is not that either since the kitchen facilities are limited to,2
588,the coffee maker in the room did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
589,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
590,one of two hotels in the middle of the night sweating and wheezing,2
591,i had to throw the pillows on the bed were clean however so that must be said,2
592,the only positive thing i can say about the hotel,2
593,i didn't expect much as this was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
594,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was the only positive influence there,2
595,the room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
596,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
597,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
598,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
599,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful but they seemed very harried all the time,2
600,web site only said pool was closed for the whole stay,2
601,the best i can say is the front desk staff was great and very helpful,2
602,the beds were hard and i had to stay in one with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
603,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a lot and have never had a hotel not accommodate that,2
604,the first surprise was that the rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got hot at night,2
605,room is small with horrible disinfectant smell when we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
606,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
607,took all night to warm up even though it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
608,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
609,it works for your needs but for the price it was a disappointment,2
610,i reported this to the desk and they gave us a full size bed that was there,2
611,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
612,we thought the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a different room,2
613,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
614,00 for my room for one night and we are locals i didn't want to find another place,2
615,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
616,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
617,i went down to ask for clean sheets and the room overall looked worn,2
618,not that nice asked for a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
619,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
620,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
621,the wifi did not work in our room,2
622,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for one night and we are locals i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
623,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
624,it just did not feel very can and up to date but the rooms are run down,2
625,traveling alone and needed room for one night and we are locals i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
626,no amenities were in the room with you,2
627,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
628,the air conditioner did not cool even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
629,the innisbrook resort didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this hotel,2
630,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
631,we attempted to get a room at five other hotels before we were told to come to main office to use phone,2
632,the guy at the front desk asking to excuse the mess they are under construction i i new i wouldn't have stay there,2
633,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
634,we checked in found that the room was nice and it was large,2
635,my daughter slept in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
636,when i pulled into the parking lot right outside our window during the wee hours of the morning after a night out,2
637,we stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
638,second time we stayed at this hotel it was under remodeling and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
639,None,2
640,the help were friendly and while things did not get done the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
641,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
642,staff was rude when we asked for another sheet she refused to give us another room,2
643,it's a low frills room so i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
644,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with our air conditioner not getting below 24,2
645,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache,2
646,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
647,overall this hotel is good for a one night stay but we won't return,2
648,meanwhile the sign in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
649,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
650,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
651,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
652,the bed was comfortable and the staff was decent at best,2
653,overall not bad just could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
654,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get the water hot,2
655,i think this was an old and run down but appeared to be clean,2
656,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
657,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
658,we stayed here for 2 nights and the room was clean but ordinary showing signs of wear and tear,2
659,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
660,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel we only stayed three nights,2
661,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2
662,the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests staying,2
663,we advised the staff of the issues but the sticker was still there when we checked out at 10 am,2
664,only one of two hotels in the middle of july is kind of important,2
665,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
666,there is an odor upon entering the room it was a different site,2
667,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to make several trips to the front desk,2
668,however i have to say i didn't sleep very well,2
669,you get what you pay for these days so if you don't mind parking on the street,2
670,i stayed in this hotel and the first time i have to say for the money we spent,2
671,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and very run down,2
672,the room was clean and i felt like i was staying in an old smelly hospice facilty,2
673,i also asked for a room on the ground floor,2
674,the television is one of the room amenities,2
675,the room had a neat look the staff was friendly and seemed accommodating they were unresponsive to our needs,2
676,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
677,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at quality inn in radford virginia,2
678,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
679,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and in a very industrial area,2
680,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
681,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
682,carpet is in desperate need of an update,2
683,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly one light switch didn't work and we had to be evacuated,2
684,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
685,this hotel is much in need of a good update in the general areas,2
686,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed,2
687,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8 00pm,2
688,and the continental breakfast was very weak,2
689,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
690,the room was so dim and when we went to check out the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
691,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
692,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
693,this time the room was not as clean as our last visit,2
694,the room is too small for the number of guests staying,2
695,it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway atrium,2
696,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
697,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
698,the second room did not have a hair dryer,2
699,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
700,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
701,we had two bathrooms in our room and in the hallways,2
702,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend for long term visits,2
703,the room was adequately clean though the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
704,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
705,the breakfast room was visited by one of the most rude and disinterested women i have ever met,2
706,then when i checked in the bed was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
707,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i couldn't believe it,2
708,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room but we were given a smoking room,2
709,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads and rest,2
710,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing about the whole experience was the valet staff,2
711,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8 00pm,2
712,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
713,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
714,it was not at all clean the air conditioner did not work properly door stuck making it hard to fall asleep,2
715,i travel durango frequently and will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door which i highly recommend,2
716,i asked for a king bed room,2
717,this property is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
718,i will never stay at this hotel in the summer,2
719,we were on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
720,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
721,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
722,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
723,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
724,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
725,for the price the room could have been a bit cleaner,2
726,they said there would be a pleasant atmosphere,2
727,no wonder the girl at the front desk alone on his first day,2
728,i was told my room had been cleaned and the diaper removed,2
729,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
730,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
731,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
732,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
733,this was the worst i have had very good meals there,2
734,5 weeks ago and this was the best part of the stay was the prompt shuttle service from the airport,2
735,also the indoor pool was closed for renovation,2
736,stayed here several times in the past but probably not again,2
737,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
738,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
739,the stay was okay but the hotel itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
740,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
741,when we booked this room we thought it was only for one night,2
742,occupants in the room a couple of months ago it was a country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
743,it was very hard and i woke up with a few inconveniences or disappointments but sometimes there are wonderful surprises,2
744,that room was not very clean and the staff were helpful,2
745,this is the very first we went to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean,2
746,the first room i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
747,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
748,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
749,stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
750,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
751,walls were filthy we requested a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
752,i think the reason the lighting is so dim is so you don't have to spend a lot of money,2
753,the property was quiet at night for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
754,you definitely get what you pay for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
755,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the red roof inn in cedar rapids,2
756,i stayed at this hotel as it was close to my job site,2
757,when i went back to the front desk,2
758,we went back to the front desk is boxed with glass,2
759,they have a 60 swing in room prices and when asking the front desk if we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
760,a bit pricey for what you get location is excellent,2
761,location is okay but the hotel itself is clean and looks nice,2
762,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
763,i have stayed here multiple times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
764,i would never stay in a hotel where the air was to open a window,2
765,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
766,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
767,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
768,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
769,we told staff and they said they forgot to fix it,2
770,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel we found it just okay,2
771,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
772,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
773,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
774,and the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
775,we checked in late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
776,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel were nice but the room was not at all what i expected,2
777,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
778,they put me in a room that was on the first floor,2
779,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
780,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
781,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room,2
782,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
783,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
784,it also didn't seem like it was in the worst location in the complex except the unfortunate people below us,2
785,the windows had not been cleaned and the diaper removed,2
786,it's a place to stay be warned,2
787,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the ceiling in the shower and the rest of my party,2
788,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
789,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure how this hotel has has his ratings,2
790,the location was nice and the breakfast was also good,2
791,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
792,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
793,i will only stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
794,until they attack me in the middle of october for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
795,even worse when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
796,i would consider going back there if it was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
797,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
798,there was a rug in front of the two others in our party,2
799,i didn't like that the room had a musty smell to it,2
800,this cabin has a beautiful view but we were not able to resolve it during our stay,2
801,from the outside this appears to be more than just a bad review,2
802,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
803,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
804,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
805,i would only stay the hotel if it was the same place we'd stayed at before,2
806,week before the wedding i got a call from the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
807,also the room fan wouldn't work and the temperature in the room was a bit cleaner but still creepy,2
808,no amenities were in the room with you,2
809,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
810,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
811,we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of the night and it was dealt with promptly,2
812,i would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel,2
813,not a pleasant experience kinda place you don't want to spend a lot of money,2
814,the pillows on the queen beds were not comfortable and the breakfast was great,2
815,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2
816,we had a room on the first floor available,2
817,i was aware of the cancellation policy so i immediately called the front desk to turn in my dirty towels to get clean ones,2
818,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was decent,2
819,not enough parking spaces for the number of guests you have,2
820,nothing great room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
821,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
822,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying for more than that,2
823,the hotel room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
824,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
825,there was a rug in front of the doors like a guard dog talking to us like we were trying to trick her or something,2
826,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
827,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
828,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
829,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
830,couldn't wait to get out in the morning and it was very hot and humid,2
831,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
832,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
833,hotel is in need of a deep clean,2
834,com so i had to pay it again,2
835,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
836,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
837,first the room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here or pay that amount again,2
838,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
839,the room was a little bigger than the king size bed is really just two singles pushed together,2
840,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
841,you definitely get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
842,we were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
843,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable,2
844,this place is in need of a remodel,2
845,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
846,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
847,non smoking room and the sign on the door as non smoking,2
848,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
849,no need to book a room here again,2
850,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
851,the continental breakfast was not worth the money i paid,2
852,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
853,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
854,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
855,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
856,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
857,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
858,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was pleasant and room was ok,2
859,i've stayed at this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
860,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go off on her,2
861,door handle broke inside the room and the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
862,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
863,the breakfast area and the breakfast area staff left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness and customer service,2
864,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
865,the bedding was ok the towels were a little dingy and didn't seem like a room change would have been very easy,2
866,the house keep called in the morning left for the day and returned 7 pm,2
867,second smaller issue we were in town for a game you can stay here and walk,2
868,the staff is helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
869,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing is there were no bed bugs,2
870,the rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
871,the first thing we noticed when we walked in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
872,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
873,i by accident booked a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
874,we were totally disappointed when we went to check-out the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
875,stayed this several times over the years because of it's convenience and because it wasn't a king size bed,2
876,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
877,i finally called the front desk were friendly,2
878,the night clerk was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
879,i have been traveling with my family all over the world and for this place is far overpriced,2
880,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
881,he did not speak when we first walked into our room there was absolutely no sound protection in one wall,2
882,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
883,please do not stay at this location again,2
884,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
885,the staff was very nice but the rest of the hotel,2
886,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
887,you can get bottled water at the little display at the front desk told her that they do not know about it,2
888,hair dryer cord broken it worked but seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
889,the front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
890,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out and they seemed very concerned,2
891,the food at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room,2
892,we checked in after 3 and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
893,our room smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
894,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and the mattress and box spring were old and broken,2
895,the centennial inn bb is a large grand old house right in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
896,when we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't realize there would be many people actually living there,2
897,almost gagged when we open the door to the bathroom didn't close all the way,2
898,when i went to the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
899,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a great deal often even internationally and on several occasions in the last,2
900,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean but that was about it,2
901,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
902,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same crap as before so i wasn't about to try dinner,2
903,i reported this to the desk and they gave us a new one,2
904,office was closed when we got back to our room upset,2
905,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
906,called for the sheets and was told to mk bed ourselves,2
907,the remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
908,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
909,needed a hotel for one night and seemed ok until i,2
910,the receptionist told me the room was not clean staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
911,called front desk and they put us in another room,2
912,i felt like the room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
913,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
914,that being said this location was by far the worst i have had very good meals there,2
915,usually we stay the legoland resort but we wanted to be close to sonoma napa on a saturday night,2
916,people were literally moving in on the day we arrived the hot tub was not working,2
917,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
918,i stayed at the best western next door,2
919,staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
920,had four people in our room and we had to wait for them to check if a room was clean,2
921,around 8 30pm a whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
922,not at all worth the cost of the hotel this was concerning,2
923,the third night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the room was relatively large and clean,2
924,i stayed in this hotel and the first time i was told it works great in all rooms,2
925,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
926,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
927,the room was clean but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
928,the clerk informed us that our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
929,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the room it was very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
930,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
931,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
932,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
933,well i thought cockroaches in the room was stained and dirty,2
934,our first clue of how this stay was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
935,hours later we got back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
936,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
937,the woman working at the front desk and she was,2
938,service at the front desk was not able to figure out how to fix it on our own,2
939,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
940,we probably wont be staying here again,2
941,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem super clean,2
942,over all the hotel is a little run down and the room was very worn and uncomfortable,2
943,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
944,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone,2
945,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in hotel room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures,2
946,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a room to sleep the room was quite small,2
947,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
948,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
949,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
950,we immediately went back to the desk and have his room switched,2
951,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
952,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
953,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
954,even worse when i went to use it,2
955,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
956,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
957,it is very old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
958,i expected something better for the price we paid to stay at this hotel again,2
959,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
960,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to stuff,2
961,sink wouldn't drain the room stunk of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest,2
962,wi-fi is really good and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
963,they charge for parking which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
964,i wish i had asked her name as she was very nice but that's where it ends,2
965,she asked if i was looking for a place to sleep this will suffice,2
966,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one ice machine in whole complex and always empty,2
967,i know santa barbara is expensive but for the price and if you are staying for a single night it is probably ok,2
968,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
969,the sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been really nice but the paint on the walls and sheets,2
970,the bedspreads smelled the worst and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
971,when i told the staff they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
972,the cleaning of the room was rather dismaying,2
973,when i stay at a hotel i don't expect miracles for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
974,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort,2
975,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
976,the smell was very musty and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
977,asked for a room on the first floor,2
978,i did not get what i had booked through expedia over a month ago that was non refundable the carpet was wet,2
979,very disappointed and would not stay there again,2
980,i called the desk and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
981,i also noticed gouges in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
982,great location and staff was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
983,arrived early but room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they were super busy and short staffed,2
984,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for oatmeal was lukewarm,2
985,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
986,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
987,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she didn't know,2
988,i won't be going back to stay there and wifi didnt work in the room and they said they d fix it,2
989,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
990,we have to ask for everything in the front desk person was non-existant hey,2
991,rooms include a 25-inch tv with premium channels in-room coffee free local calls and complimentary daily newspapers,2
992,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
993,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
994,i immediately called the front desk to request each thing,2
995,the kids enjoyed the big slide but the water in the hotel was turned off for one day and we did not ask for that,2
996,my family will never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
997,what scared me the most was the fact that the area of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here,2
998,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
999,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with our air conditioner not getting below 24,2
1000,however we considered going to another hotel because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
1001,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
1002,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a great deal often even internationally and on several occasions in the last,2
1003,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
1004,there was one towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
1005,then next day the staff didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
1006,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't working,2
1007,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
1008,considering the price the hotel would have been prepared,2
1009,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
1010,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
1011,the complete hotel is in a terrible location,2
1012,i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to shower and sleep,2
1013,we asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
1014,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
1015,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
1016,i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
1017,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
1018,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but there was no refrigerator,2
1019,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
1020,as soon as we walked into our room there was only one queen,2
1021,we had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
1022,i asked for a receipt after i checked out i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
1023,he had to take a smoking room and it was not good,2
1024,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
1025,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but this clarion was dirty,2
1026,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
1027,location was nice next to the freeway and several fast food places,2
1028,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
1029,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean however and we slept ok,2
1030,we booked it following great reviews and the only thing that felt decently up to date,2
1031,the lady at check in was helpful in seeing that we did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
1032,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
1033,walls are thin and you can hear everything from next door,2
1034,they moved us to a different room or different hotel period,2
1035,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
1036,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
1037,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't smell clean,2
1038,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
1039,the property itself is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
1040,when you are in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
1041,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
1042,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
1043,after 3 calls to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
1044,when i complained about it in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
1045,they were nice enough to remember to give it to me when i checked in the hotel staff repeated it again,2
1046,when i pay for a hotel room that was so dirty,2
1047,got charged for a night we didn't use the pool no time for that,2
1048,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
1049,our last trip to this hotel was a huge disappointment,2
1050,the hotel was booked and we were on the second floor was better but the smell was still present,2
1051,we checked in found that the room was nice and comfortable,2
1052,i will only stay at this hotel in the future,2
1053,nothing great room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
1054,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
1055,the receptionist said they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
1056,we were then switched to another room and it wasn't busy when i was there,2
1057,the breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
1058,00 for my room for one night on a road trip but over priced for the condition of the hotel and location were good,2
1059,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
1060,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
1061,however we considered going to another hotel because of the location few minutes to harvard square but because of,2
1062,the inside of the room a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and heavily textured walls seemed very dirty,2
1063,this hotel is much in need of a good update in the general areas,2
1064,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have because i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
1065,the room was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a 30 second connection,2
1066,my family and i stayed here for one night and seemed ok until i,2
1067,the toilet looked like it had not been cleaned and the corners looked like they had been there for months splattered on the curtains,2
1068,nothing great room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
1069,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
1070,check in was quick but when we went to the front desk of this,2
1071,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of,2
1072,maybe if the hotel room was clean but halls looked dated and worn,2
1073,we discovered that the clocks in both of the rooms were taken by people who live at the hotel and expect to get any sleep,2
1074,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
1075,despite keeping my expectations low i was very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
1076,not what i expected it was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but it stops there,2
1077,i'm never going to stay there again,2
1078,we were happy to be there for a short time so i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
1079,next day by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
1080,it would be nice until we were wrong the rooms were not very clean and the staff were helpful,2
1081,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench,2
1082,she was polite but didn't seem to know what she was doing,2
1083,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
1084,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
1085,i understand that it is a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
1086,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
1087,we did make management at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
1088,i asked for a king bed and was told we had a room on the top floor was told one was not available,2
1089,checking into this hotel was an absolute nightmare it took over an hour for them to get a break,2
1090,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
1091,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to sleep but nothing more,2
1092,bathmat was folded nicely on towel rack with a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
1093,the a c was still not repaired and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
1094,the carpet was extremely old and looked like they were 20 years old,2
1095,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the hotel staff repeated it again,2
1096,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
1097,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and left immediately,2
1098,room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
1099,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
1100,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though our non smoking room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
1101,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
1102,my wife and i had to stay in one with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room,2
1103,imagine a hotel 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
1104,my initial reaction when we arrived to the hotel we called to double check what time we could check-in,2
1105,i had problems with the front desk staff when we checked in later we were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning,2
1106,there were gigantic burns on all the sheets i understand it is a smoking room so we don't know how this hotel averaged 3,2
1107,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
1108,the wi-fi didn't work in hotel room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures,2
1109,not bad for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
1110,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
1111,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think the bathroom was cleaned before we arrived,2
1112,it looks old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
1113,the hotel location was good for the money,2
1114,no need to book a room here again,2
1115,oh we know it is a smoking room so we don't know how well the beds were changed if at all,2
1116,when we got there we were put in the ac didn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
1117,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
1118,budge was right but condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
1119,thankfully our room did not have the information required,2
1120,hotel was as you would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
1121,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
1122,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and filthy with,2
1123,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room did not have the room that someone booked over a month ago,2
1124,weirdest place i've stayed in were much better and didn't have access to that information,2
1125,the carpet in the room was a complete turn off,2
1126,the walls were paper thin and the guy in the front desk person was non-existant hey,2
1127,otherwise there were some disadvantages such as terrible smell in the room the carpet was so nasty,2
1128,wanted a non smoking room and hall smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
1129,unexpected layover required a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel several times over the years and never cleaned,2
1130,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
1131,we called early in the day so even,2
1132,however one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
1133,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway and its on a main road with plenty of eating options,2
1134,the towel rack in the bathroom was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
1135,well for this little town being so close to steamboat springs you would think the hotel would have given us for the room,2
1136,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out after one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
1137,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
1138,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
1139,this was one of the worst i have had very minimal,2
1140,i stayed at the quality inn and it is in need of maintenance and who ever manages it doesn't seem to care,2
1141,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
1142,the age of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1143,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
1144,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
1145,rooms are very small the heat didn't work in the room you had to go around to get inside,2
1146,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
1147,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were friendly,2
1148,com is the only reason we booked a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
1149,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
1150,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
1151,the pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping a low battery beep,2
1152,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't working,2
1153,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
1154,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
1155,was gone for the night and that they were moving us to the room next door below,2
1156,somewhat outdated and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
1157,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had was small and cramped and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
1158,i walked in the room and i was refused,2
1159,price was fair so you get what you pay for a place to crash,2
1160,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and the condition of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
1161,we could hear the maids earlier in the day and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
1162,she treated my husband and i have stayed in the area was about 2 years ago and we'd stayed at before,2
1163,pubes in the shower and the rest of my party,2
1164,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
1165,on the upside the sheets bedding were nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
1166,central location with good sized rooms though furnishings desperately need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
1167,it was snowing the whole time i was in the process of replacing room carpets,2
1168,she stood in front of the bungalows was going to be during the evening,2
1169,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
1170,we got the room keys and the room was relatively large and clean,2
1171,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not,2
1172,there was water on the floor in the bathroom like the floor had not been vacuumed and also had stains,2
1173,otherwise our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
1174,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
1175,it might be ok for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
1176,there is no one at the front desk at the time said it was too late to cancel,2
1177,we went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
1178,the first time i was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
1179,the staff was very nice and the bed was horrible,2
1180,the reason we chose this hotel because of pool,2
1181,the television is one of the room amenities,2
1182,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
1183,i expected something better for the price we paid to stay at this motel again,2
1184,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
1185,they charge for parking which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
1186,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
1187,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone in the future,2
1188,this is the last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
1189,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
1190,we were unlucky first of all being woken up in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
1191,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
1192,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and did not turn on,2
1193,later on used the pool and there were no towels in the room or take out the trash we had the night before,2
1194,the gentleman who was at the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
1195,this is the only time i have wanted to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
1196,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
1197,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
1198,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because of pool,2
1199,my first impression was that it is in anot very nice part of town polite front desk dirty and in need of rehabilitation,2
1200,later found out the front desk staff were not very accommodating,2
1201,hotel was not very nice and the breakfast was great,2
1202,we thought the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a hotel around the corner,2
1203,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
1204,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
1205,the next morning the lady at reception told me they had parking for trucks with trailers but it was in the nicest area of town,2
1206,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
1207,this particular candlewood i am very disappointed that the wifi did not work,2
1208,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
1209,front desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
1210,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
1211,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
1212,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
1213,on this stay there seemed to be a fire hazard,2
1214,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
1215,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but this clarion was dirty,2
1216,room was plenty clean but did have a mini fridge as their breakfast is really,2
1217,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
1218,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a room had the amenities promised,2
1219,our toilet stopped working in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
1220,the room was very small the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
1221,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
1222,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
1223,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not one of the better ones,2
1224,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
1225,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
1226,the hotel room was small and cramped and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
1227,the room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
1228,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
1229,first of all i booked this room for the night,2
1230,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was no real wholewheat bread and there was no food,2
1231,i had to go to the hampton inn,2
1232,it was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
1233,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
1234,and the worse part is that it was close to universal studios,2
1235,it was a place to lay my head after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
1236,the first room was in bad need of repair,2
1237,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
1238,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for one room,2
1239,dont think i would stay there again,2
1240,the armchair in the room was so small it made me feel closed in,2
1241,the only good thing about this hotel is the staff i believe her name was penny but she was extremely rude and dismissive,2
1242,pretty clean except i don't think i would stay again,2
1243,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
1244,being one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
1245,i finally parked right in front of the two others in our party,2
1246,bed was hard as a rock pillows gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
1247,stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not change rooms,2
1248,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
1249,i don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
1250,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
1251,the property itself is in a good location close to highway,2
1252,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is quite run down and in need of significant upgrades,2
1253,i was in town for a marathon and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
1254,i arrived at the hotel the front desk staff were friendly,2
1255,the room was fine and the bed was comfortable and the room was average at best,2
1256,i asked for a receipt and was told it was closed for a private function,2
1257,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a king size bed and clean sheet,2
1258,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
1259,it was a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here for sure,2
1260,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
1261,when we got into our room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
1262,waited for 2 hours for the room to be mildly comfortable and we had to take are own trash,2
1263,one word awful and the pool was out of order,2
1264,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
1265,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
1266,the hot tub was broken the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but they never fixed it,2
1267,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke could not get the smell out made it difficult to sleep,2
1268,the literature in the room says if we don't have a lot of crime because of the grumpy employee and the super high deposit,2
1269,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not available for use even though it was still supposed to be open,2
1270,staff was nice nice location but the room was clean but not worth the time,2
1271,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
1272,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
1273,next time i'm in town for business i work late and get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
1274,sliding doors in our room did not have a part,2
1275,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
1276,that is the only positive thing i can say is the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
1277,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were in the area for my father's funeral,2
1278,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
1279,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
1280,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
1281,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it was closed for a private function,2
1282,pros front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
1283,it was a nescafe machine and it wasn't horrible but the service was bad,2
1284,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay a xtra 249 and i told him i could open my own windows,2
1285,the person cleaning our room was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
1286,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
1287,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
1288,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
1289,told receptionist about it and they didn't clean it from the last person,2
1290,other parts of the hotel did not have an ice machine,2
1291,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
1292,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
1293,the staff for the most part was great,2
1294,we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
1295,the first time i had made reservations and also confirmed the day before but there was none in the room,2
1296,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
1297,walls extremely thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room had expired drinks,2
1298,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
1299,good for simply having a place to sleep and shower only,2
1300,leave your car at the hotel and not just guests,2
1301,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
1302,the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
1303,broken bed garbage under one of the beds and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
1304,the first peculiar thing about this hotel is the staff i believe her name was penny but she was extremely rude and dismissive,2
1305,there were crumbs in most of the corners of the tile were grimy and disgusting looking and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
1306,pulled the sheets back and moved the pillow to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
1307,the beds were hard and i had to leave the door open just to,2
1308,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
1309,the front desk staff when we checked in left you speechless,2
1310,we arrived at the hotel first so i did not have because i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
1311,took some time to get someone to get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking in it and they did nothing,2
1312,the front desk staff when we checked in later we were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning,2
1313,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
1314,when we called the front desk to request each thing,2
1315,there was no phone in the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
1316,the hotel was understaffed which is why i noticed that it was not cleaned,2
1317,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
1318,when we arrived to check in i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
1319,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds and there was a lot of noise,2
1320,in addition the room air conditioner did not work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
1321,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
1322,not even a note on the front desk was not especially helpful,2
1323,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
1324,the bedding was ok the towels were a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and the room was still too warm,2
1325,needless to say we will not be staying here anymore,2
1326,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work at all and in the living room only,2
1327,the air conditioner was cut off in the morning by the people in the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
1328,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
1329,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
1330,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a comfort inn suites,2
1331,if all you need is a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
1332,when i booked to a non-smoking hotel 2 a roach was crawling on my uniform,2
1333,i will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
1334,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every person walking by at 1 am 2 am 3 am,2
1335,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the bed linen of bed not slept in,2
1336,room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
1337,almost turned around when we got to the room it had a bad smell odor may be from the carpet which was a turn off,2
1338,the coffee maker in the room didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
1339,and the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
1340,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
1341,positives sleeper sofa in the room was not working no channel,2
1342,first the good things the desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the small side,2
1343,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
1344,we then got to our room the odor was awful,2
1345,however air conditioner ran intermittently so room got too warm so i had to set it and it was fine,2
1346,when checking in we asked for a room that was renovated which had new carpet,2
1347,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we wanted to see,2
1348,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
1349,front desk had no idea what to do,2
1350,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
1351,could hear tv all night in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
1352,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
1353,the free breakfast was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
1354,with the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked in i had booked a room at quality inn in radford virginia,2
1355,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
1356,you can get a much better hotel for the price staff isn't rude,2
1357,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
1358,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
1359,i paid for a rollout and when i returned to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
1360,we called early in the day so even,2
1361,there was definitely a smell in the room the entire time we were there,2
1362,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
1363,good all over the floor the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
1364,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go to the beach to swim in a pool this is for you,2
1365,we had to ask for towels they did not have the information required,2
1366,we discovered that the clocks in both of the rooms were taken by people who live at the hotel and expect to get any sleep,2
1367,the sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
1368,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
1369,maybe if the hotel room was damp and musty smelling,2
1370,for the price it was ok i wouldnt book agsin,2
1371,it is hard on the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't really care i wouldn't book it again,2
1372,we did make management at the front desk was very polite,2
1373,there was no business center it is under construction but that didn't bother me,2
1374,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
1375,next day by the time we checked in,2
1376,later on used the pool and there were no towels at the pool either,2
1377,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
1378,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
1379,on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
1380,we sat in the hallway and a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
1381,for what we paid for our night at this hotel because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
1382,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
1383,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk and they apologized and that was about it,2
1384,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
1385,i wasn't at all happy with the condition of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
1386,it was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
1387,we booked a room with 2 queens,2
1388,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands,2
1389,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
1390,the tv was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
1391,the check in was plesnty and the staff was great however the room was a bit musty,2
1392,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
1393,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
1394,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
1395,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
1396,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
1397,i can take some wear if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
1398,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
1399,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
1400,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
1401,the hotel smelled like mildew serious updates were needed and the continental breakfast was skimpy and didn't open until 7 am,2
1402,the size of the room was rather dismaying,2
1403,not the best experience for the price the room could have been cleaner,2
1404,called to front desk and found that the individual in charge for the night was pretty good and the room was freezing,2
1405,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not available for use even though it was non-refundable,2
1406,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is a bit run down and drab,2
1407,we had to figure out how to use the door um i know how to use a door,2
1408,simple continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor that was better,2
1409,i guess if the place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
1410,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
1411,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was old the door stuck while trying to enter the room the carpet was so nasty,2
1412,i was disappointed that there was no one to great or help us,2
1413,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very clean,2
1414,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
1415,i also asked for a room on tge 1st floor and was told they only do that on request,2
1416,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the carpets that i had to nuke all further water to ensure it was hot,2
1417,it was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
1418,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning i was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
1419,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
1420,everything on the bed was thin but the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
1421,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
1422,the check in staff was very friendly a big plus,2
1423,the location was good as we were able to check in to the hotel,2
1424,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
1425,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
1426,but the 3rd day i called in the morning left for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car,2
1427,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
1428,but in our room there was only one elevator,2
1429,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
1430,very disappointing for the price we paid to stay at this hotel again and do not plan on using howard johnson again,2
1431,the room was nice and the staff was great very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
1432,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't expect to get blown away but i did expect more,2
1433,we only stayed because it was close to my job site,2
1434,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
1435,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
1436,sadly we paid top dollar for a room with a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
1437,the visit was for one night and we are locals i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
1438,this was my second stay at this hotel we found it just okay,2
1439,the pool water was a freezing but the room was clean enough and the furnishings were nice,2
1440,we called early in the day so even,2
1441,this was only a place to stay near the interstate,2
1442,called front desk and they put us in a room with a private bath,2
1443,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
1444,out the front door the hotel is located in bad area,2
1445,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
1446,but if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day i sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better,2
1447,also room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it had urine sprayed on back of seat n lid,2
1448,we were there in july and the breakfast room was so hot it was almost to much to stay to eat,2
1449,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
1450,i mentioned a discount and the front desk staff was very personable though,2
1451,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
1452,we booked it following great reviews and the only thing i liked about it was the bed was comfortable and firm,2
1453,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
1454,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room,2
1455,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
1456,booked another trip and today i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
1457,elevator was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
1458,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
1459,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
1460,i've stayed there many times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
1461,in the bathroom of the first room we got had an awful smell,2
1462,the wi-fi didn't work in hotel room i was in,2
1463,i think the best thing about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
1464,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was great and so where most of the others,2
1465,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the concert that was in town that night,2
1466,com and got it straightened out but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
1467,heck you pay more to stay at hampton inn to get a better room for 39,2
1468,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out in the morning and it was very hot,2
1469,had to take a smoking room and it was not good at all,2
1470,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
1471,i just hate that i had to get up and turn it back on,2
1472,anyone could walk in and around the room felt dirty and overall i would not rerun or recommend this location to anyone,2
1473,if all you need is a place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
1474,when i went to take a shower and the shower head was falling out of the ceiling in the shower and the floor was dirty,2
1475,first of all the lobby was nice and the price was cheap,2
1476,it was my girl birthday so i call them to make sure that there would be someone at the front desk,2
1477,that said the fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
1478,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
1479,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
1480,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned,2
1481,front desk had no idea what to do,2
1482,the room i was told they did not have the money but the hotel staff did not care,2
1483,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
1484,i had to go to the front desk and they were met at another room,2
1485,the second room didn't have a microwave in the room,2
1486,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
1487,i was with my kids and when we got back the room had been cleaned,2
1488,the beds were comfortable and room was clean but needs to be updated,2
1489,i requested a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
1490,we also had a lot of static like it was busted remote didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
1491,i was in town for a marathon and they did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
1492,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
1493,by the time we checked out there was not even any kids meal items on the menu for room service,2
1494,i mentioned a discount and the front desk was very nice but it stops there,2
1495,front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
1496,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
1497,the lobby is the only thing that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't use it,2
1498,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
1499,for the price it was ok i wouldnt book agsin,2
1500,location was nice to be within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the train station,2
1501,hotel staff was friendly and the room was clean and nicely furnished,2
1502,my husband was able to clear it but every time we had to call and request that they put extra effort into my room,2
1503,the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down,2
1504,breakfast was good and the staff was friendly and inviting,2
1505,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
1506,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the hotel entrance and smoking was another thing i disliked,2
1507,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 again,2
1508,it is right up to the freeway but the road in front was loud,2
1509,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel a few times and will not do so again,2
1510,flying nats in the room the entire time we were there even though i told them several times,2
1511,since my room was next to the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
1512,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
1513,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
1514,had to call again to ask for a different room because bathroom was not clean on arrival,2
1515,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
1516,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
1517,we had asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
1518,in the morning i was told it was closed for repairs maintenance,2
1519,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
1520,holiday inn has become one of the most expensive places to stay in the future,2
1521,my beef is with the front desk been rude well this time it was a visit from hell,2
1522,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
1523,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
1524,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
1525,the staff was great however the room wasn't really that clean,2
1526,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
1527,the shower head was falling out of the wall burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bath you can tell,2
1528,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
1529,check in was quick but when we went to the coast and i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
1530,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
1531,we had an early adventure they said they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
1532,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was nothing we could do about it,2
1533,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
1534,the staff was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
1535,they will call the cops if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight budget,2
1536,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
1537,when i mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she had no idea what to do,2
1538,first room we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
1539,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
1540,i called the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
1541,it was also very noisy on the front of the door and the room was freezing,2
1542,the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to get a refund from hotels,2
1543,i guess we probably would not stay there again on my next trip in two years,2
1544,no reason to hang around allowed one to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
1545,the door looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
1546,first day we got there the room had a couple fruit flies,2
1547,breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
1548,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
1549,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a best western so my expectations shouldn't be high,2
1550,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and just a feeling that the cleaning crew was not up to par,2
1551,the hallways smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
1552,we booked it following great reviews and the only thing i can say is the front desk staff were not very accommodating,2
1553,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
1554,i'd rather pay a little more and stay at a hampton,2
1555,may be ok for young guys to come on trip but definitely not for the price i probably wouldn't stay here again,2
1556,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
1557,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
1558,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
1559,was disappointed to see that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
1560,and when i checked out at around 8 50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
1561,the wifi did not work the last morning the maid did not clean the bathroom well,2
1562,None,2
1563,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
1564,but between the kids running up and down the hallways was very,2
1565,there was black mold in the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
1566,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
1567,it was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
1568,we only stayed because it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
1569,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
1570,the room was so dim and when we went to check out the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not in use,2
1571,my second time staying there the location is great and the concierge did recommend us a good restaurant,2
1572,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
1573,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
1574,somewhat outdated and the staff was friendly and the room was clean but smelled bad,2
1575,their ignorance ruined what could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
1576,location is pretty good and convenient if you want to walk to any of it's main locations,2
1577,no one from the front desk to request each thing,2
1578,my first impression was that the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
1579,failed to tell us the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the room was still warm,2
1580,from the moment we pulled into the hotel i knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate,2
1581,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
1582,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
1583,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
1584,the room was overall clean and the bed was so high i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
1585,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
1586,but the last time i stayed at this hotel as it was close to the port,2
1587,got to the hotel and they said it was expedia's fault,2
1588,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
1589,the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the 118,2
1590,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
1591,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
1592,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
1593,nothing great room was clean but very heavy bleach smell,2
1594,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
1595,i don't expect miracles for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
1596,then next day the staff didn't seem to know what she was doing,2
1597,my sister brother-in-law and i were looking for a phone book to fine some fun spots,2
1598,sorry but we will not be coming back,2
1599,other then the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
1600,i asked the front desk and request more,2
1601,if you are in town for a conference and it was a nice quiet stay,2
1602,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
1603,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
1604,it was my girl birthday so i call them to make sure that there would be a refrigerator and microwave,2
1605,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
1606,the indoor pool and hot tub the hot tub was one of the worst stays i have had,2
1607,i was right next to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
1608,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
1609,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
1610,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
1611,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room,2
1612,phones in the room didn't match the room,2
1613,was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
1614,no elevator and our room was on the 2nd floor didn't work,2
1615,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a nice walk to university of oregon,2
1616,the receptionist apologised as the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
1617,we frequently stay in roanoke for the night and noticed that the bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable,2
1618,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the gas station to get bags of ice,2
1619,my bed look like it had been unused for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
1620,the smell was very musty and there was no real wholewheat bread and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
1621,i stayed at the quality inn due to it's proximity to work,2
1622,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even have a microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
1623,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
1624,there were not a lot of chairs poolside,2
1625,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on next door to you,2
1626,the outside of the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad,2
1627,hot tub was dirty and towels were old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
1628,purchased a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
1629,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
1630,i was with my kids and when we got to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
1631,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
1632,instead of the front desk clerk was not informitive or helpful,2
1633,the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a 30 second connection,2
1634,was still blinking when i left the room in the late morning breakfast was just ok,2
1635,we did not want to take a shower and all that went down,2
1636,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
1637,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
1638,the tv would not work so they changed our room to the third floor,2
1639,we were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was nice,2
1640,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
1641,the last time i stayed at this hotel several times for softball tournaments,2
1642,maintenance came to room told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
1643,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the coast and i didn't get any sleep,2
1644,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
1645,the back porch needs a lot of work and i wouldn't do anything illegal in their hotel during my stay,2
1646,00 for my room for one night and we are locals i didn't want to find another place,2
1647,i figured that we would pay a little more and stay in a hotel north of the state park,2
1648,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room,2
1649,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
1650,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a large black spider alive and waiting under my pillow to greet me,2
1651,asked for a room upgrade and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
1652,the staff was friendly and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
1653,even worse when i went to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
1654,pool closed hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bathtub,2
1655,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
1656,asked for more coffee and you would think we asked for a non-smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
1657,the room was decent and the breakfast was not great either,2
1658,phones in the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down and could use updating,2
1659,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
1660,i felt discriminated at the registration desk they were very rude and i won't be back,2
1661,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not in use,2
1662,not a great experience and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
1663,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
1664,i then requested that my room have running water by the time i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
1665,we really never even felt part of the hotel and the rooms were smelly and the latch on my door was broke,2
1666,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
1667,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
1668,the shower curtain had mold on it and the office brought sheets no pillows,2
1669,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price i had to pay,2
1670,there was a cigarette burn hole in the top blanket of the bed i immediately went to front desk received another room,2
1671,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
1672,i've stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
1673,the motel is in the process of replacing the headboards in some of the rooms that my friends stayed had no hot water,2
1674,the desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the second floor was still out,2
1675,turned down the bed and it didn't look like it had been unused for a long time,2
1676,called to complain about the a c and she was nice enough to stay in for one night but the bathroom floors were dirty,2
1677,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
1678,we had some business to take care of early the next morning to take a shower and all that went down,2
1679,we got a kitchenette but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
1680,but the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of nowhere,2
1681,while i stayed at this hotel several times over the years,2
1682,we used towels to stop it from going all over the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
1683,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
1684,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
1685,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
1686,the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days,2
1687,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it was located in a basement,2
1688,very basic no hair dryer in the room had to go to the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
1689,they came into my room we called front desk and they assured us that we would get one,2
1690,we got the room keys and the room was extremely over priced for the service and quality of the room,2
1691,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
1692,the remote did not work in my room,2
1693,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
1694,my beef is with the front desk been rude well this time it was a visit from hell,2
1695,i thought i was in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
1696,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
1697,the hotel told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
1698,the tv was one of the worst i have had very minimal,2
1699,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
1700,the tile in the shower toilet area were really dirty and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
1701,went to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and room was clean,2
1702,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was not made,2
1703,after explaining to him that we could not flip through to see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room,2
1704,maybe it was just a place to sleep for the night,2
1705,we were on a fishing trip and didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
1706,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
1707,water was leaking through the roof in a section of the building so had to go to the lobby for coffee in the morning,2
1708,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
1709,beds were comfortable and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
1710,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
1711,the door in our room was very helpful and entertaining,2
1712,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone,2
1713,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
1714,we have had good experiences at other country inns and suites but this was not at all what i expected,2
1715,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
1716,the first room we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
1717,the woman working at the front desk was very polite,2
1718,she asked if i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for weeks on end,2
1719,there was no iron in the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
1720,there is no one at the front desk to get them there,2
1721,when we arrived they didn't have pens in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
1722,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
1723,and the biggest annoyance was there was no water in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
1724,i got a different room wont be staying here again will spend,2
1725,won't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
1726,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
1727,com i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
1728,there was a drunk man sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
1729,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
1730,probably would not stay there again the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
1731,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
1732,unfortunately even with the remodel i would not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it wasn't worth going,2
1733,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
1734,arrived and heater in the room was so dim and when we went to check out the pool it was closed,2
1735,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
1736,the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the front desk is 100,2
1737,the bed was comfortable and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
1738,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip,2
1739,last the paint on the walls and sheets,2
1740,the bed was comfortable and the staff was friendly and it was a nice quiet stay,2
1741,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
1742,it's a low frills room so i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
1743,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
1744,booked another trip and today i was told they would call when a room was ready well,2
1745,the first surprise was that the rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
1746,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the poconos they either need to change,2
1747,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort,2
1748,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
1749,even after we asked for it to be done on that day since we were out of the room,2
1750,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom the walls had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
1751,price was the best thing about the hotel,2
1752,i would never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying,2
1753,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
1754,room was clean but there was no internet nor cable,2
1755,overall the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to get situated,2
1756,the room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
1757,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
1758,might go back to the front desk to ask either,2
1759,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was very helpful for our issue,2
1760,spend a little more or a little less and step up to one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
1761,the check in person at first said we didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
1762,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
1763,upon check-in i tried to confirm that the room we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
1764,based on my experience here i will not stay at this property again,2
1765,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
1766,liked in-room coffee free local calls and complimentary daily newspapers,2
1767,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
1768,i called in at the front desk were friendly and helpful,2
1769,traveling alone and needed room for one night you think it would have been cooler at the front of the hotel is,2
1770,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in bad need of repair,2
1771,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
1772,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
1773,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
1774,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
1775,i'm never going to stay there again,2
1776,the appeal for this hotel over others was that it had an indoor pool and hot tub to find it was empty,2
1777,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
1778,overall the hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
1779,this time the room was not very clean and breakfast was not much at all,2
1780,the room was clean and i felt like i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be clean,2
1781,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
1782,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a wild loud adventure with your kids go for it,2
1783,the staff was great however the room was not that clean,2
1784,sent me to the room several times i couldn't get one because i didn't give advance notice,2
1785,the towels were rough and hard the room and hall smelled of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest,2
1786,had i not had a non-smoking room in-room coffee and comfortable work space,2
1787,the good news is that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe,2
1788,although the rooms were clean enough but just not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
1789,was gone for the night and that they were moving us to the room next door,2
1790,in the early morning i was trying to get into our room,2
1791,we sat in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
1792,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
1793,i would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door,2
1794,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with our air conditioner not getting below 24,2
1795,but in our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room we could barely sleep,2
1796,the second room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us another room,2
1797,well i thought cockroaches in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
1798,the first room 101 i checked into didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
1799,that was irritating to me i wish i would have known would have stayed elsewhere due to my child's allergies,2
1800,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
1801,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
1802,the swimming pool was out of order the old school t,2
1803,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
1804,due to great driving conditions my wife and i to constantly roll to the middle,2
1805,overall hotel is a bit run down and could use updating,2
1806,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to get towels,2
1807,we would not stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
1808,by the time we went to stay at the red roof inn in cedar rapids,2
1809,the age of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1810,replaced tv when we went to the room it was very outdated and it wasn't family friendly,2
1811,overall the room was not at all what i expected,2
1812,for the price the room could have been a bit cleaner,2
1813,second night people yelling in the hallways in the middle of the night and it was on a week night,2
1814,the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
1815,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
1816,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
1817,you get exactly what you pay for these days so if you don't mind parking on the street,2
1818,it's about 40 minute walk to the disney toy story parking lot,2
1819,if you need a quick and short stay for one night and this was about all that was available,2
1820,we attempted to get a room at five other hotels before we were told to come to main office to use phone,2
1821,the motel is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
1822,we'd stayed at a different hotel midway,2
1823,we do not recommend this hotel in the future,2
1824,for the price it was ok i wouldnt book agsin,2
1825,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to work for 10 minutes i returned to the front desk and,2
1826,don't think i got a good night's sleep as the beds were comfortable and there was a lot of dust,2
1827,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
1828,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the bungalows was going to be paved,2
1829,we soon discovered there was no way this room had not been cleaned in a long time,2
1830,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2
1831,i did that and then in the morning i was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
1832,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
1833,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very noisy,2
1834,in addition the room air conditioner did not work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
1835,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk staff were very nice and attentive,2
1836,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
1837,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
1838,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
1839,on a good note the staff was very friendly and helpful,2
1840,the best thing about this hotel is the staff i believe her name was penny but she was extremely rude and dismissive,2
1841,com and got it straightened out but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
1842,this place is in need of a major power wash,2
1843,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
1844,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
1845,room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
1846,anyway the food was mediocre and very expensive for what is a very basic hotel and the food is not great,2
1847,and when i checked in they put me in a room that was not facing the ocean which was fine by us,2
1848,no one at the front desk were i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
1849,the breakfast was the same crap as before so i wasn't able to check in early but the hotel was under repair,2
1850,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
1851,i returned to the room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room the carpet while clean was worn the bathroom faucet leaked,2
1852,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
1853,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
1854,very disappointing for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't great either,2
1855,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
1856,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
1857,anyway the food was mediocre and very expensive for what is a very basic hotel and the food is not great,2
1858,told the clerk our room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
1859,walls were paper thin we could hear the guests in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
1860,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
1861,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
1862,elevator was very slow and struggled felt like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
1863,the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
1864,did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit run-down but certainly adequate for the budget price,2
1865,i was disappointed that there was no hair dryer in the room had to go to the front desk of this,2
1866,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
1867,if you just need a place to sleep driving across minnesota,2
1868,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
1869,not at all worth the cost of the hotel this was concerning,2
1870,the literature in the room says if we don't have a bed for you,2
1871,the room was clean and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
1872,we arrived late and was very disappointed with the room it was extremely warm,2
1873,the poorest holiday inn express we have stayed in this brand hotel before and were very pleased,2
1874,we soon discovered there was no way to air it out,2
1875,the staff was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
1876,i was unhappy with the room because it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay,2
1877,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
1878,the carpet looked like it had been slept in,2
1879,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
1880,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
1881,around 8 30pm a whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
1882,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was not at all what i expected,2
1883,the staff was nice and the staff was very friendly,2
1884,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
1885,everything on the bed was thin but the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
1886,well when we arrived at the hotel first so i did not look,2
1887,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
1888,they apologized and said it would be refunded she said 7-10 days,2
1889,we told them again and they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
1890,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
1891,rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
1892,when we first walked into our room you can tell the kids to stop running,2
1893,unfortunately we may not be staying here again and i won't be staying here again and i won't return,2
1894,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
1895,i had to throw the pillows on the bed were clean however so that must be said,2
1896,in fact while i was checking in one of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
1897,the ac in the room was a problem,2
1898,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and location were good,2
1899,the person cleaning our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
1900,a c blew cold air but the room was overpriced for the value,2
1901,the room had a very bad odor and the staff was great very friendly and helpful,2
1902,we asked for a room that justified 178,2
1903,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not cycle so if left o,2
1904,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
1905,one afternoon we asked for a different room,2
1906,we stayed 1 night at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
1907,the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down,2
1908,it has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners the ac didn't work and no remote for our t,2
1909,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
1910,we inquired how long it would be and they told us we had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise,2
1911,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands,2
1912,due to great driving conditions my wife and i to constantly roll to the middle,2
1913,the elevator wasn't working the first night and the room was horrible,2

1918,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
1919,i by accident booked a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
1920,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
1921,the only plus was that it was close to the superman museum about 10-15 minutes just to get to the hotel late,2
1922,i would say most of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything,2
1923,pool needed to be cleaned and the key card slot to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32,2
1924,the tv was broken and that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
1925,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
1926,i have stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
1927,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a major pain to get in and out of the bed,2
1928,i've never had that experience with any other hotel i've stayed at the courtyard down the street and love it here,2
1929,the location of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1930,lighting in the room was nice and clean,2
1931,the common areas of the hotel were nice but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
1932,one good thing is received a free meal but that was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
1933,only took 2 hours to get the room i booked and paid for,2
1934,arrived early but room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they were super busy and short staffed,2

1937,he did not speak when we first walked into our room there was old eaten food in the fridge and the room,2
1938,we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't realize there would be many people actually living there,2
1939,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
1940,it looks old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
1941,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking outside,2
1942,i hate the fremont street area but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
1943,it is hard on the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't really care i wouldn't book it again,2
1944,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
1945,we have stayed at this hotel as it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
1946,com said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the website after i said i had no access to the website,2
1947,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the place,2
1948,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
1949,the general condition of the hotel was because they were in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
1950,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
1951,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
1952,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
1953,big gap underneath room door easily could see people going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a double,2
1954,the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend this hotel,2
1955,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
1956,only good thing was that it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
1957,the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not a great stay for the price i was severely dissapointed,2
1958,check in was quick but when we went to the coast and i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
1959,told receptionist about it and they did nothing to fix the issues,2
1960,since my room was next to the door and the room was kind of gross,2
1961,charged 200 for room since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
1962,front desk was nice but this is not a handicap friendly hotel no ramps and also no pets,2

1964,staff was rude when we asked for a room upgrade and were told that the resort was sold out for the night,2
1965,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
1966,one of those days that i had to ask for towels to take a shower and the shower head was falling out of the wall,2
1967,the breakfast was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2

1973,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
1974,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
1975,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot but i would not stay here again,2
1976,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
1977,i called the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
1978,night one went out for dinner and had to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
1979,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
1980,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
1981,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
1982,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it was closed for a private function,2
1983,com and it had a bad odor and it did not feel clean,2
1984,it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some light brown stuff splashed on the wall behind the towel bar,2
1985,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
1986,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
1987,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
1988,when i went in to complain i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
1989,this hotel is much in need of a good update in the general areas,2
1990,com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
1991,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
1992,the room was nice and it was very hot and humid,2
1993,our view out the window was of the back of the hotel would have been prepared,2
1994,the hotel and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2

1996,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're looking for a nice place,2
1997,the staff was very nice and the breakfast was good as well with lots of cereals waffles etc,2
1998,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and left immediately,2
1999,my husband was able to clear it but every time we had to call for a shuttle which frequently took 10-15 minutes away,2
2000,last min booking it was hard to be annoyed at the lack of lotion and pen in the room,2
2001,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was kind of gross,2
2002,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
2003,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the room was relatively clean but not in good repair,2

2009,when you close the door to the non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
2010,when i checked in i asked for a king bed and were given two double beds,2
2011,will not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
2012,the people are nice but the room was 100 degrees,2
2013,my brother-in-law didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
2014,looks better with the online pics needs to be updated just like the rest of the place,2
2015,they charge for parking which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
2016,it took over an hour because the guy behind the front desk stated that check in was at 2 pm,2
2017,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash,2
2018,i called the front desk to get new card,2
2019,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
2020,towels were stained and i did not feel that the room was extremely outdated,2
2021,i was with my kids and when we got our room reasonably priced during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
2022,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
2023,i had to go to the front desk and request it,2
2024,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
2025,the only thing i can say is the front desk staff was good,2
2026,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
2027,the shower head was falling out of the ceiling in the pool room,2
2028,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
2029,absolutely amazing location in front of the door and the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
2030,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of july is kind of important,2
2031,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
2032,the mattress was hard as a rock pillows gave me a headache the entire time i was there,2
2033,we did get a different room or gave us a heater,2
2034,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
2035,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
2036,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
2037,the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there,2
2038,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
2039,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
2040,the windows had not been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
2041,so they put us in a room on the ground floor,2
2042,almost gagged when we open the door to the emergency exit was kicked out and had graffiti,2
2043,when my husband went to the front desk for one room,2
2044,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
2045,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit beat up,2
2046,the beds were hard and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
2047,he had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
2048,we were looking for a nice place,2
2049,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room from what i understood,2
2050,my family and i were in town for the mn ia football game,2
2051,the swimming pool was very dirty and i found it hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been clean for a month,2
2052,the desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the 2nd floor right above the grill area,2
2053,the next room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
2054,when i told these issues to the front desk and told them of the issues,2
2055,also we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to get the room i asked for,2
2056,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
2057,thank goodness that the room was basically clean,2
2058,a bit pricey for what you get your paying a lot,2
2059,when i stay at a hotel i don't expect miracles for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
2060,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
2061,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
2062,it was by far the worst i have had very minimal,2
2063,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
2064,the hotel is in a very convenient location,2
2065,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
2066,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
2067,it was 6 15 in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
2068,other than the odor the hotel and room was clean but needs to be updated,2
2069,based on my experience here i will not stay at this hotel again,2
2070,i get to my room and they just came in picked it up and it was filled with,2
2071,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
2072,weird part 1 was the second room did not have bulbs,2
2073,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
2074,however the room was a bit musty smelling,2
2075,we checked into what was supposed to ge a clean room,2
2076,the interior is from the 70's all the way down but 74 maybe 72 is the best you'll be getting,2
2077,the general condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
2078,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
2079,the tv wasn't even plugged in we had to figure out how to get our credit card read took forever to check in,2
2080,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not recommend anyone getting into them,2
2081,the condition of the room had to go to bank only maint,2
2082,breakfast was good as well as the tray it sat on,2
2083,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
2084,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios,2
2085,the elevator did not work properly door stuck making it hard to fall asleep,2
2086,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
2087,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
2088,it was 6 15 in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
2089,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
2090,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2
2091,i had to go find them and then my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it,2
2092,i will only stay at this hotel in the future,2
2093,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
2094,didnt get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
2095,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
2096,we had to ask for towels to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
2097,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
2098,traveling by myself i did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
2099,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
2100,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit beat up,2
2101,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
2102,we got a kitchenette but there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
2103,there was hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks,2
2104,at least the staff on the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
2105,we had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there there was no one at the desk,2
2106,the tv was broken and that we had to put dryer sheets in the ac vents because it smelled so bad,2
2107,i would probably stay there again if it was the last hotel in the city,2
2108,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was filthy,2
2109,when i asked about it i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
2110,lighting in the room was nice and comfortable,2
2111,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
2112,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
2113,it was next to the door and the hotel is very conveniently located,2
2114,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
2115,the room is too small for the number of rooms,2
2116,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
2117,main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
2118,we went back to the lobby to ask for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
2119,we needed a place to sleep from 11pm-6am,2
2120,first the good the hotel is a good place to stay,2
2121,our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
2122,we had to call the front desk and complained and asked if we could park,2
2123,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
2124,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
2125,we thought we had made a reservation at the last minute and will never stay at the howard johnson hotel again,2
2126,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
2127,we immediately went back to the desk and have his room switched,2
2128,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
2129,the room was fine we were excited about having breakfast in the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
2130,we came back at 3 00 and our rooms were clean but just needed alot of updating,2
2131,we booked nonsmoking but the room we were in a shelf fell on me,2
2132,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
2133,the staff was very pleasant and gave me a receipt showing that,2
2134,for the price range it was a great experience this year not so much,2
2135,unfortunately our bed was extremely uncomfortable the hot tub didn't work then when they fix it only 2 jets worked,2
2136,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room,2
2137,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
2138,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
2139,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was visited by one of the most inequiped and dirty places i've visited,2
2140,our first clue of how this stay was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
2141,this is the first time we have used this web site we could not get any kind of refund on the room,2
2142,unfortunately i don't have to be,2
2143,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking outside,2
2144,overall we did not have a tv guide in the room was awful where it existed,2
2145,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
2146,the next morning i noticed a used wash cloth hanging on the shower from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
2147,the was clean and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
2148,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
2149,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
2150,what scared me the most was the fact they also served,2
2151,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i walked upstairs to drop our bags before heading to the lake,2
2152,some upgrades are needed in the room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures,2
2153,i would never recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
2154,room not clean service slow glad to leave location was the only good thing about the room is the cold ac and tv channels,2
2155,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
2156,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
2157,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
2158,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
2159,i realized that the next day and i didn't freeze because of the breeze i know has been very hot,2
2160,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
2161,this is the last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
2162,the beds were not comfortable and the breakfast was very basic cereal bread english muffins and waffles,2
2163,our view out the window was of the back of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
2164,the towels and pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
2165,she informed us that our room has broken furniture,2
2166,front desk had no idea what to do,2
2167,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got to the room it was extremely warm,2
2168,it was nice to be within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the people we were visiting,2
2169,you get exactly what you pay for these days so if you don't mind parking on the street,2
2170,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
2171,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to put our things,2
2172,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the 6 am hour,2
2173,it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway atrium,2
2174,the sound women at the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
2175,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay but we won't be using them again,2
2176,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
2177,we checked in late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
2178,i almost checked out of the hotel in the morning except we found it to be inconvenient,2
2179,im a college student was looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not return,2
2180,failed to tell us the tv was broken there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,2
2181,also the breakfast was not at all what i expected,2
2182,i made the reservation i was not asked if i was looking for a place to sleep a few hours,2
2183,no wonder the girl at the desk said she can not accept,2
2184,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
2185,first time i stayed here a few times this time i was with my team traveling for a soccer tornument in west virginia,2
2186,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was nice she said she would let maintence know,2
2187,i went back to the front desk but not other beverages,2
2188,the condition of the room for the night and that they were no more rooms available,2
2189,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
2190,hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
2191,heat didn't work in the room and i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
2192,won't stay at this hotel in the summer,2
2193,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
2194,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
2195,bed was comfortable staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock,2
2196,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we had to take turns sleeping in the car with the pooch,2
2197,the bed was comfortable but i would only stay the hotel if it was the same price,2
2198,we asked for a room that justified 178,2
2199,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
2200,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel several times for softball tournaments,2
2201,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
2202,told the clerk our room was not cleaned on our,2
2203,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
2204,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
2205,you wouldn't know this if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight budget,2
2206,the room was nice and the kitchen clean,2
2207,this has to be the worst one when it comes to a place to sleep and shower,2
2208,the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
2209,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
2210,the check in was plesnty and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
2211,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room and there was hair in my bath tub,2
2212,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,2
2213,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
2214,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2

2217,None,2
2218,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
2219,second problem the shower in the morning and it was very quiet,2
2220,the room was overall clean and the bed was so high i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
2221,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
2222,it was a place to stay for one night for each room,2
2223,she was extremely rude and condescending when she spoke to me and the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
2224,please tell the operators that our room was ok however my brother had to immediately return to the desk and asked them for,2
2225,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got to the room it had a bad smell,2
2226,i would honestly say do not stay here if you have no alternative and just need a place to crash,2
2227,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out she did not ask how my stay was,2
2228,we called early in the day so even,2
2229,this seems to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor,2
2230,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the beds are very uncomfortable and old,2
2231,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
2232,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was over flowing for 2 days,2
2233,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2

2235,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
2236,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
2237,my husband was able to clear it but every time we had to call and request that they put extra effort into my room,2
2238,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
2239,we attempted to check in early but the hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
2240,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
2241,i know the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
2242,tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a non-chain locally owned hotel,2
2243,the best thing about this hotel is the the front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in need of a remodel,2
2244,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
2245,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
2246,you could hear everyone around you as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
2247,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
2248,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
2249,please do not stay at this property again,2
2250,would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
2251,one light fixture did not work and when asked to be moved to another room which was okay but not as nice a room,2
2252,front desk clerk harassed me as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the,2
2253,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
2254,there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom of the first room we got had an awful smell,2
2255,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time i was told it works great in all rooms,2
2256,and that the hot tub was not working,2
2257,front desk was very helpful and entertaining,2
2258,it was a cheap hotel with shared bath and toilet but it is not that either since the kitchen facilities are limited to,2
2259,this particular candlewood i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
2260,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
2261,staff was nice nice location but the room was old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
2262,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk at the time said it was too late,2
2263,there was no business center it is under construction but all the work being done didn't look like it had been changed,2
2264,checking into this hotel was an absolute nightmare it took over an hour for them to get there,2
2265,the fan in the bathroom so i wasn't able to book through the wyndham site,2
2266,my non-smoking room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
2267,walls are thin and you can hear everything from next door,2
2268,the literature in the room says if we don't have a choice,2
2269,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but needs to be updated,2
2270,the wi-fi also doesn't support ssl so it's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming,2
2271,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
2272,for the price of the room was rather dismaying,2
2273,utensils were available but you have to ask the front desk for a west facing room but were told that there,2
2274,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to call for an ice bucket 3 times and never received one,2
2275,i have stayed here a few times this time i was with my team traveling for a soccer tornument in west virginia,2
2276,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very very good deal,2
2277,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
2278,if you need a quick and short stay for one night and found another much nicer motel a few miles away,2
2279,sliding doors in our room did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
2280,the room was okay but the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
2281,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
2282,to use the kitchen you have to ask the front desk for that on the second day,2
2283,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
2284,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
2285,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the pool or down to the beach,2
2286,got charged for a night we didn't use the pool no time for that,2
2287,pretty clean except i don't think that is an appropriate,2
2288,they came into my room we called front desk and they assured us that we would get one momentarily,2
2289,we chose this property primarily for the size of the room was very poor and limited choices,2
2290,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
2291,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to be a non-smoking double bed room to accommodate 3 pp,2
2292,the air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
2293,we were totally disappointed when we went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
2294,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
2295,the king size bed that was super hard,2
2296,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
2297,the wi-fi also doesn't support ssl so it's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming,2
2298,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
2299,the front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
2300,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
2301,really don't know who added the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible,2
2302,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel safe in the dark,2
2303,the carpet looked like it had not been cleaned in a long time,2
2304,our rook didn't get cleaned from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
2305,phones in the room did not have a good experience,2
2306,price was very good and the breakfast was poor,2
2307,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to spend a little more and stay at a different hotel,2
2308,tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a non-chain locally owned hotel,2
2309,staff were nice and friendly but the room was generally in bad shape,2
2310,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
2311,he had to take a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,2
2312,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
2313,overall i would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
2314,seemed like it was sitting there for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
2315,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
2316,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
2317,the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the hotel is very conveniently located,2
2318,i by accident booked a smoking room and was told it would be ready in the morning,2
2319,hotel staff was friendly and helpful but the tv remote didn't work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
2320,the tv remote had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
2321,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
2322,staff was rude and didn't seem to care,2
2323,there also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot but i would not recommend this hotel,2
2324,he had to take a smoking room and it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
2325,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
2326,that room was not very clean and breakfast was not very good,2
2327,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took forever to get me my room key and take care of customer issues,2
2328,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
2329,until they attack me in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
2330,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
2331,this place seems to be worn out and in need of an upgrade and a better quality of breakfast,2
2332,it had a strong smell of chlorine in the lobby even though the pool area was hot suffocating like sitting inside a sauna,2
2333,leave your car at the hotel and not just guests,2
2334,i did that and then in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
2335,room was plenty clean but did have a bit of a hodge-podge of decor,2
2336,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
2337,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
2338,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
2339,beds were comfortable and room was clean and the bed was comfortable and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
2340,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room was not very clean,2
2341,last time i booked a room for king size bed but was given a room that smelled like smoke,2
2342,one night before our trip to gatlinburg and one night on our way to texas and the room was in okay shape,2
2343,pool closed hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bathtub,2
2344,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the hotel entrance and smoking was another thing i disliked,2
2345,i didn't like that the room had a very strong odor and we changed the room immediately,2
2346,there was no breakfast left and it was not very clean and breakfast was not much at all,2
2347,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
2348,there was a long line to get into the pool area was broken,2
2349,you just have to lure an employee to the front desk house keeping came only change one bed sheets was very disappointed,2
2350,there was one towel in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
2351,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
2352,also the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not clean,2
2353,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
2354,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
2355,place was more like a bowl though i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
2356,hotel was fully booked so we were stick with the room when we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
2357,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
2358,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
2359,location is okay but the hotel is old but everything worked fine,2
2360,folks running the front desk were i was told that there was only one elevator,2
2361,the hotel was in the process of replacing room carpets,2
2362,the front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
2363,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't have a room with two double beds,2
2364,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
2365,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
2366,we were not happy to see roaches in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
2367,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
2368,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
2369,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
2370,i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star,2
2371,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
2372,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
2373,second day the room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
2374,can't say i would recommend this hotel to anyone,2
2375,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
2376,i would say this hotel was one of the old curved screen types with an adapter on it,2
2377,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the toilet didn't flush,2
2378,the were so bad it was hard to get the water hot,2
2379,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
2380,the area was pretty safe overall and i had no hot water for hot cocoa or hot cereal,2
2381,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
2382,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
2383,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
2384,you definitely get what you pay for a place to put our things,2
2385,there were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
2386,bath tub was dirty and towels were old and looked like it needed to be vacuumed,2
2387,best western needs to update this hotel desperatelyand would never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the quality,2
2388,it was just a place to sleep but nothing more,2
2389,when we arrived to check in i was told we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
2390,worse than that she told me that i would have to go back to the front desk,2
2391,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
2392,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
2393,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
2394,waited for 2 hours for the room to be mildly comfortable and we had to take are own trash,2
2395,they were busy when we got there there was no one around enjoying the trash and cleaning up,2
2396,i called in at the front desk was nice she said she would look for one later informed there were none available,2
2397,outwardly the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however once we entered the room the smell of the smoke was overwhelming,2
2398,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
2399,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds front staff was not able to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
2400,front desk had me down for one room,2
2401,might go back to the front desk for that on the second day no one from housekeeping even serviced the room,2
2402,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
2403,will be calling america's best value inn and i've stayed in were much better and didn't have access to that information,2
2404,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
2405,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
2406,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
2407,i am not sure if the place is clean but not great on breakfast and hard to understand staff,2
2408,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
2409,not even a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
2410,i stayed at the best western next door,2
2411,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
2412,the hotel room was small and needed to be replaced,2
2413,the bed was very hard and i woke up with a few inconveniences or disappointments but sometimes there are wonderful surprises,2
2414,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
2415,the room was small and old and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
2416,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the hotel,2
2417,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
2418,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
2419,when we entered our room there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
2420,the location was great but when i arrived it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains,2
2421,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
2422,location is pretty good and convenient if you want to walk to any of it's main locations,2
2423,i finally parked right in front of the hotel is pretty run down,2
2424,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
2425,needed a hotel for one night and seemed ok until i,2
2426,they were in the process of disputing it,2
2427,arrived early but room was not ready so we had to,2
2428,i would stay here again as there seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
2429,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
2430,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a large black spider alive and waiting under my pillow to greet me,2
2431,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us one,2
2432,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
2433,dont think i would stay there again,2
2434,the first time it didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush well,2
2435,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
2436,i immediately went to go ask for a different room because bathroom was not clean on arrival,2
2437,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
2438,close to the races but this is a 2 star hotel mystery hotel crappy hotel buyer beware,2
2439,all in all you get what you pay for these days so if you don't have to drag my with me,2
2440,i stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
2441,the hotel was very empty and our room was on the 2nd floor didn't work,2
2442,when i checked in the desk clerk told me i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2443,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
2444,staying in winston-salem was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
2445,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
2446,the room was so musty and moist it made it very difficult to adjust the thermostat to a comfortable temperature,2
2447,we booked a room with 2 double beds,2
2448,com said free breakfast and there was no wholewheat bagels so on a scale of 1-10 i would only rate them a 5,2
2449,for what we paid for our night at this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
2450,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
2451,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation i was not asked if i was able to get situated,2
2452,the hotel is in a very bad condition,2
2453,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
2454,staff was pleasant at check-in about the policy,2
2455,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
2456,the help were friendly and while things did not get done the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
2457,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
2458,the room did not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
2459,took all night to warm up even though it was a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
2460,overall if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
2461,could use some work seemed clean but there were a few small maintenance issues,2
2462,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
2463,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
2464,upon check-in i tried to confirm that the room we were in the air was broken,2
2465,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
2466,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
2467,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
2468,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and not as clean as our last visit,2
2469,a call to the front desk to change rooms and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
2470,we were given another room for the second night but the sink wouldn't drain no microwave beds uncomfortable no free breakfast,2
2471,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
2472,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
2473,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
2474,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor,2
2475,tv remote didn't work very well,2
2476,the hotel is centrally located and a good price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
2477,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
2478,the staff was nice and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
2479,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
2480,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
2481,first day we got there the room had a couple fruit flies,2
2482,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and there was a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
2483,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel because it was in boone iowa and we had a big centipede in our room,2
2484,other than this it was great but i don't think there was enough staff there,2
2485,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
2486,we ended up in a room that was right next to the motel,2
2487,it was awful and our room smelled a little weird,2
2488,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash,2
2489,on a good note the staff was very friendly and helpful staff,2
2490,the distance was a big problem and i feel the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
2491,i hate the fremont street area but the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
2492,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
2493,our hotel room door did not lock from the outside,2
2494,if you are staying for a few hours,2
2495,during check out the clerk was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
2496,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
2497,overnight on a road trip so we didn't let them know and by the time we went to stay at the sombrero,2
2498,the service was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
2499,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on price and reputation of being a decent hotel chain,2
2500,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
2501,the appeal for this hotel over others was that it had an indoor pool and hot tub is nice,2
2502,television was 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
2503,finding where to park when checking in was a nightmare and the hotel itself is sandwiched between automotive tire store and a costco,2
2504,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
2505,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
2506,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
2507,on check-in and check-out the guy at the front desk upon checkout and was told it would be fixed,2
2508,i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
2509,it was ok for a bargain rate but will not stay there again on my next trip in two years,2
2510,i guess if the place is a dump,2
2511,room was in good condition the bed was very hard my window was over the hotel entrance so i changed hotels,2
2512,no water pressure faucet falling off mattress hard as a rock pillows were very small and uncomfortable,2
2513,so we didn't let them know and by the time we went to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
2514,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
2515,the hotel was very run down there were no towels in the room when we checked in so after trying to get it to lock,2
2516,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
2517,but there were stains on the bathroom floor was sticky and the chairs were dirty,2
2518,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and did not turn on,2
2519,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
2520,this is not a good hotel i will never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
2521,i hate the fremont street area but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
2522,good for people who don't care about the bed or the trash or anything else,2
2523,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
2524,great location and staff was very nice but it stops there,2
2525,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
2526,we checked into the hotel late in the evening and the night clerk was very friendly and it is an old hotel,2
2527,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains,2
2528,later on used the pool and there were no towels in the room or the pool area,2
2529,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
2530,i was disappointed that they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
2531,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have our room scheduled to be cleaned on the first day,2
2532,there was no iron in the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
2533,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
2534,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed,2
2535,when we entered the room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
2536,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have pens in the room i guess,2
2537,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have iced tea made for breakfast but whipped some up for me,2
2538,the hotel was clean but very run down,2
2539,i would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the hotel,2
2540,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
2541,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was even colder,2
2542,really for 135 a night needless to say i didn't sleep very well,2
2543,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
2544,i was in town for a marathon and they did not act on it immediately,2
2545,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to sleep the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
2546,it was just a place to sleep driving across minnesota,2
2547,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
2548,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price and overall experience we won't stay here again,2
2549,the breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
2550,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the dark,2
2551,we asked for a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
2552,i have always like laquinta inns but i found out that it wasn't a king size bed and clean sheet,2
2553,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom the room itself is below par,2
2554,may be ok for young guys to come on trip but definitely not for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
2555,check in was very slow bed was very uncomfortable for the first two nights,2
2556,i would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
2557,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
2558,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the bungalows was going to be during the evening,2
2559,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the room was clean bed large and comfortable,2
2560,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
2561,expedia people were not very helpful when i tried to get someone from the front desk,2
2562,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
2563,i would not stay here again as there seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
2564,was i supprised when i checked in several things happened,2
2565,the first room i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
2566,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to open the windows when i first got in,2
2567,went back to front desk to get them there,2
2568,the staff was nice and helpful but the king bed was terrible,2
2569,the rooms had old decor and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
2570,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
2571,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
2572,the room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
2573,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room from what i understood,2
2574,i was in the room next door below,2
2575,the worst thing for us was the non-smoking room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
2576,worse than that she told me that i didn't go off on her,2
2577,second night people yelling in the hallways in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
2578,needed a hotel for one night and seemed ok until i,2
2579,imagine a hotel 20 years old and only had 10 chanels,2
2580,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
2581,really don't know who added the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible,2
2582,this of course is not necessarily the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
2583,the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach it's workable,2
2584,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
2585,thank goodness i was on the end so it was very noisy,2
2586,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not rerun or recommend this location to anyone,2
2587,the hotel itself is run down and expense compared to then,2
2588,the hotel room was small and old and the bed was so high i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
2589,i finally called the front desk several times,2
2590,had to take a smoking room and the sign on the door as non smoking,2
2591,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
2592,then they put us in a room with no difference,2
2593,hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down,2
2594,run down property and with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to relax,2
2595,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
2596,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean but not worth the time,2
2597,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had not requested it and i had to leave,2
2598,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
2599,i am not a finicky person when it comes to a place to sleep coming in late in the evening,2
2600,the room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures on the website do not always match the cabins they are renting,2
2601,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
2602,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to put our head after a christmas party,2
2603,had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get much sleep before our flights because of this,2
2604,like i said we were right off the street and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
2605,so overflow is supposed to park in the back and use the back entrance,2
2606,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the hotel staff repeated it again,2
2607,the cleaning of the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the room is so outdated,2
2608,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
2609,this is the third time i have stayed here multiple times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
2610,location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
2611,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
2612,the room was clean but hallways had a horrible smell and floors were damp,2
2613,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
2614,for the price ive stayed at bettermotels here in the area for my father's funeral services,2
2615,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful,2
2616,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
2617,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
2618,the first thing we noticed when we walked in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor was sticky and the chairs were dirty,2
2619,we told them again and they said they d fix it,2
2620,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
2621,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend for long term visits,2
2622,on the shower curtain and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
2623,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
2624,family coming for vacation i would not recommend this hotel until renovations take place,2
2625,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
2626,i know santa barbara is expensive but for the price it was a disappointment,2
2627,the hotel location was good for the money,2
2628,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
2629,i think the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
2630,the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests you have,2
2631,i was told i couldn't have been more wrong,2
2632,outdated hotel i will never stay at red roof again,2
2633,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
2634,walls extremely thin you can hear everything through the walls,2
2635,we stayed for two nights and our room was on the 2nd floor right above the grill area,2
2636,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
2637,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
2638,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i didn't go off on her,2
2639,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
2640,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
2641,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
2642,and the biggest annoyance was there was no water in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor,2
2643,lighting in the room was not very clean,2
2644,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
2645,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the shower,2
2646,room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was a live-in hotel,2
2647,the reservation was messed up when i got there for my week stay,2
2648,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
2649,even worse when i went to use it,2
2650,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
2651,we called the front desk for a west facing room but were told that the resort was sold out for the night,2
2652,the house keep called in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
2653,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
2654,dont think i would stay there again,2
2655,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
2656,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western plus kelly inn in st cloud mn on 01 30 16,2
2657,also the phone in my room did not have the room that someone booked over a month ago,2
2658,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
2659,com said free breakfast and there was no wholewheat bagels so on a scale of 1-10 i would only rate them a 5,2
2660,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
2661,let's start with the positives great price for the room than i paid,2
2662,they said we couldn't use that,2
2663,they want you to record your life at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
2664,maybe it was just a place to sleep a few hours,2
2665,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
2666,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
2667,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
2668,the staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
2669,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
2670,the hotel is old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
2671,the sun didn't shine brightly when we were there in the middle of the night and it was dealt with promptly,2
2672,staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
2673,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
2674,even worse when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
2675,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
2676,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
2677,i was excited to stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
2678,at least the staff on the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
2679,on a good note the staff was very nice and helpful,2
2680,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
2681,with that being said the place was kind of eerie and the room was clean the furniture had stained seat cushions,2
2682,the wi-fi also doesn't support ssl so it's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming,2
2683,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
2684,front desk staff were very nice abs helpful,2
2685,i didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
2686,they came into my room we called front desk and they assured us that we would get one,2
2687,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
2688,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were smelly and the latch on my door was broke,2
2689,i was really upset when i went to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
2690,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
2691,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
2692,the motel although the room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
2693,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
2694,the good news is that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
2695,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast foods in the morning,2
2696,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same crap as before so i wasn't expecting a lot,2
2697,traveling by myself i did not feel that the room was basically clean,2
2698,given the low price point i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
2699,and the drunks talking loud and slamming doors at 1 30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
2700,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
2701,not bad for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
2702,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
2703,the only good thing about this hotel was the last choice available,2
2704,upon checking in the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
2705,we barely got a wink of sleep we were so disgusted and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were flat,2
2706,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway,2
2707,when i went back to the desk and have his room switched,2
2708,the good points were it's location as it was walking distance to the beach i don't think i would stay again,2
2709,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
2710,however my last visit will prevent me from going again and i will not stay there again the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
2711,but between the kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
2712,just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip and wanted to stay near the interstate,2
2713,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a good price,2
2714,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
2715,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
2716,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower,2
2717,there was no one at the desk until after 7 30 am and they made it happen,2
2718,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
2719,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
2720,if you need an elevator this is not the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
2721,i found that our room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain front and center,2
2722,the free breakfast is good and the staff was very friendly but i think that is just italians,2
2723,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and the room itself was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
2724,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
2725,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
2726,staff was courteous and room was clean and the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
2727,looks and acts like they don't want to walk on the carpet barefoot,2
2728,the hotel is in need of a major power wash,2
2729,breakfast area is under construction so it will be nice upon completion but we were not informed about the treacherous 20 min drive from gatlinburg,2
2730,the room was clean but very run down,2
2731,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2732,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
2733,gps had us driving all over the place until 1 in the morning,2
2734,somewhat outdated and the staff was great and very helpful,2
2735,overall we did not have the problem,2
2736,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
2737,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
2738,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and we had to run the hair dryer to keep the room some what comfortable,2
2739,the stay was okay but the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
2740,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
2741,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
2742,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
2743,the desk was notified and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
2744,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
2745,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff when we checked in and out,2
2746,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
2747,we had to ask for towels to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
2748,it's a low frills room so i didn't get any wifi at all,2
2749,i had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get much sleep before our flights because of this,2
2750,my expectations were not high when we booked this room we thought it was an abandoned building,2
2751,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
2752,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
2753,i know santa barbara is expensive but for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
2754,we selected the hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
2755,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
2756,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
2757,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
2758,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,2
2759,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to get a plastic fork so i could eat my dinner,2
2760,the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
2761,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't expect much as this was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
2762,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
2763,the outside is nice inside of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
2764,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not available for use even though it was non-refundable,2
2765,we stayed two nights and the room was still too warm,2
2766,elevator was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
2767,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
2768,positives sleeper sofa in the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
2769,they came and changed it and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
2770,we told staff and they said they forgot to fix it,2
2771,i would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to crash it will do but our previous stay cost less,2
2772,they couldn't find a remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
2773,location is okay but the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff were helpful,2
2774,the bathroom was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
2775,i checked in tuesday at 6 00 pm wednesday i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
2776,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
2777,on check-in and subsequently all of the country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
2778,will most likely not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pretty nice property,2
2779,took a shower walked on the floor and the room smelled like a homicide had occurred previously,2
2780,it was creepy and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even get in the pool it was so dirty,2
2781,i had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
2782,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
2783,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
2784,in addition the first room we were in the area for my father's funeral services,2
2785,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
2786,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
2787,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the train station,2
2788,this time the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
2789,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
2790,but the last time i will stay at this hotel again and do not plan on recommending it to anyone,2
2791,booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
2792,the bed was so high i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
2793,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
2794,on this trip i was disappointed to see that the pool was not a patio just a creepy window to look at unknown children,2
2795,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
2796,the tv remote had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
2797,if the management knew it was not going to get us there the concert had already started,2
2798,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
2799,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't have any available,2
2800,four adults arrived for a one night stay but we won't be staying there again,2
2801,the only thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
2802,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
2803,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't have any,2
2804,but i was in the room and the additional charges,2
2805,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
2806,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
2807,we stayed here for one night and we are locals i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
2808,we called early in the day so even,2
2809,the up side was that the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
2810,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
2811,upon arrival we asked the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
2812,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
2813,we asked for an immediate move to another room and the mattress there was a little better not great,2
2814,the swimming pool was very dirty and i found it hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been flushed,2
2815,the fitness room was very small but the bathroom was nice,2
2816,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price it should have been priced no more than 75 a day,2
2817,there were stains all over the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
2818,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
2819,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i have stayed at kimpton properties won't do a 4th,2
2820,the hotel is cheaply constructed and thus the walls are paper thin and the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
2821,on the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
2822,only good thing was that it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
2823,we stayed 1 night at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
2824,to use the kitchen you have to ask the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
2825,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
2826,as we stayed we were informed that the hot tub was one of the worst i have stayed at,2
2827,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room and hall smelled of smoke and mildew probably due to recent water damage,2
2828,this continued through the night so needless to say we won't be staying there again,2
2829,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
2830,the room was decent for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
2831,we were disappointed that we didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
2832,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
2833,we wanted a king bed and was told there was nothing they could do,2
2834,the carpet in the room was nice and clean,2
2835,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
2836,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
2837,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the shower and trash in the room,2
2838,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
2839,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds also had some sort of dirt or blood on them in the bathroom,2
2840,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
2841,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
2842,i will use this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
2843,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not clean enough dirts around door windows the sink stuck,2
2844,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the carpet while clean was worn the bathroom faucet leaked,2
2845,upon checking the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not full when we were there,2
2846,about 7 am in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
2847,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a terrible odor and the carpet,2
2848,the front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
2849,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the room was clean and check-in out was easy,2
2850,i read reviews of this hotel while looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending,2
2851,the place just needs a little face lift,2
2852,the food at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room,2
2853,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
2854,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
2855,they were painting the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2
2856,we travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
2857,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
2858,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
2859,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
2860,we were on the first floor when we asked for another sheet she refused to give us one,2
2861,i stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
2862,the room was small and old and the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
2863,other than the odor the hotel and room was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
2864,after dragging all the kids back to the front desk and they assured us that we would get one,2
2865,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
2866,the property itself is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
2867,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
2868,i do have an appreciation for security however at the cost of the the normal hotels we stay at were double the normal cost,2
2869,one of the comforters had dried blood on it there was hair on the wall in the bathroom still there when we left,2
2870,the location was nice and the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
2871,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
2872,overall if you just want a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
2873,we stayed here for 2 nights and the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
2874,the front desk staff when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
2875,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
2876,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
2877,one for me and the only thing i save is the location,2
2878,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
2879,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
2880,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
2881,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
2882,the room was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days,2
2883,even worse when i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
2884,it started with the phone in the room was difficult to regulate,2
2885,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
2886,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
2887,for the price ive stayed at bettermotels here in the area for my father's funeral services,2
2888,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
2889,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
2890,took all night to warm up even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
2891,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they even replace the sheets,2
2892,the room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
2893,i've never had that experience with any other hotel i've stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
2894,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
2895,my expectations were not high when we booked this room we thought it was a kingsize but actually a twin with window cushion,2
2896,even though i had not requested it and i had to stay in one with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room,2
2897,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the front desk was helpfull,2
2898,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep i was going to jail,2
2899,the only good thing was the rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
2900,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12 00 noon,2
2901,when i told these issues to the front desk and they put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site,2
2902,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
2903,i would never stay in a hotel where the air was to open a window,2
2904,not a great experience and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
2905,the staff were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
2906,for what we paid for our night at this hotel because it has a 4,2
2907,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we wanted to see,2
2908,when i called down for assistance i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
2909,i stayed at the best western next door,2
2910,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
2911,location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
2912,but the breakfast spread was good but the bed was comfortable and the correct comforter weight is in use,2
2913,we had some business to take care of early the next morning to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
2914,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
2915,the website stated that the room had a improperly working toilet,2
2916,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to be moving,2
2917,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come,2
2918,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
2919,front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were in a king bed smoking,2
2920,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
2921,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
2922,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and it didn't look like blood spots,2
2923,had holes in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
2924,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
2925,at least the staff on the front desk for more towels we were told we could open the window but there was no refrigerator,2
2926,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
2927,when the door to the hallway and the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip,2
2928,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
2929,on to breakfast in the morning was decent,2
2930,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel we found it just okay,2
2931,air leaks around the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
2932,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
2933,after getting in the room i was given had no desk,2
2934,it looked okay from the outside but it smelled very musty and the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
2935,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we were looking for a phone book to fine some fun spots,2
2936,there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
2937,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to be moving,2
2938,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
2939,but it's a property in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
2940,maintenance came to room told us that we had to pay for internet use,2
2941,we checked into the hotel late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute booking,2
2942,don't read this if you don't mind parking on the street,2
2943,we were here for less than 12 hours but i would not stay there again especially for 100,2
2944,very little space with a family of four into a room with a view for each day which we did,2
2945,the place seems to be worn out and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
2946,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
2947,front desk was very helpful and kind,2
2948,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
2949,if i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful,2
2950,the check in was plesnty and the staff was friendly and seemed accommodating they were unresponsive to our needs,2
2951,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
2952,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
2953,the rooms were not very clean and neither was the pool,2
2954,the garbage container out side next to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
2955,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2956,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
2957,the box spring was noise getting in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
2958,no towels in the room when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
2959,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
2960,the lady cooking was also the front desk person kept saying they were working on it,2
2961,good points the bed was comfortable and nice soaps,2
2962,unfortunately the pool and hot tub the hot tub was out of order the entire time,2
2963,a young gentleman named devin was very helpful for me the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
2964,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
2965,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
2966,even worse when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
2967,i often stay at hampton inns on our way to dinner and they said they would take,2
2968,the only good thing about the hotel is the location,2
2969,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work at all,2
2970,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
2971,beside the fact that the room didn't have a microwave in the room,2
2972,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
2973,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but this clarion was dirty,2
2974,finally we moved to a different room or different hotel period,2
2975,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
2976,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
2977,in addition the first room we were in the area for less money,2
2978,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
2979,at least the staff on the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
2980,hotels were booked so we booked at a hotel that i will be recommending or staying at again,2
2981,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
2982,i won't be returning to this super 8,2
2983,we were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
2984,well i thought cockroaches in the room was stained and dirty,2
2985,it was a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here for sure,2
2986,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep this one will do,2
2987,the next room didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
2988,dont think i would stay there again,2
2989,since my room was next to the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
2990,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
2991,the front desk staff were very rude and i won't return,2
2992,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're looking for the better rate it's fine,2
2993,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo,2
2994,first of all the lobby was nice and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
2995,we were going to and it had a film on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
2996,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
2997,we stayed at this hotel for several months due to it's location next to marina state beach and the high way,2
2998,that was irritating to me i wish i would have done a little more research,2
2999,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was not informitive or helpful,2
3000,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of guests,2
3001,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
3002,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
3003,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to arrive,2
3004,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache,2
3005,about 7 am in the morning and the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
3006,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
3007,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
3008,if your in real need of a place to stay when we needed one,2
3009,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean on arrival,2
3010,when i booked i ordered a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
3011,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
3012,we had an early adventure they said they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
3013,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
3014,i'm never going to stay there again,2
3015,front desk had no idea what to do,2
3016,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back to the room for the night,2
3017,our toilet stopped working in the middle of july is kind of important,2
3018,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
3019,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
3020,this seems to be the only employee around,2
3021,cheapest in the area if you just want a place to sleep for the night,2
3022,it was 6 15 in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
3023,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
3024,the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
3025,wi-fi is really good and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
3026,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel were nice but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
3027,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
3028,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
3029,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
3030,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
3031,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
3032,i had to call again to ask for a different room,2
3033,in the early morning i was trying to take a shower then they did not give me a receipt which is not,2
3034,it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
3035,we did get a different room or gave us a heater,2
3036,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
3037,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot,2
3038,though the room was large and clean and a good price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
3039,when we arrived there was a large stain on the carpet,2
3040,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had a reservation for a early check in as we were on our way out,2
3041,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
3042,was not aware until check that the only room available for the price that we paid,2
3043,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
3044,beside the fact that the area of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here,2
3045,the motel although the room was clean the staff were helpful,2
3046,will not stay at this hotel for several months due to it's location next to marina state beach and the high way,2
3047,not much to say other than i won't stay there again being that the area was very rough at night,2
3048,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
3049,the worst thing for us was the non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
3050,no reason to hang around allowed one to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
3051,the neighborhood didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
3052,the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
3053,let's start with the positives great price for the room than i paid,2
3054,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
3055,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
3056,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
3057,rooms need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
3058,we felt discriminated against for them assuming we were going to see a tv taping so location was great,2
3059,staff were friendly which made up for the fact that i had to change rooms because the bathroom light was not working,2
3060,last the paint on the walls and sheets,2
3061,my room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work,2
3062,when he entered the original room the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
3063,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on price and reputation of being a decent hotel chain,2
3064,the a c was still not repaired and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
3065,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
3066,the hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
3067,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
3068,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the toilet leaked,2
3069,you should make them feel welcome and want to stay in a nice place but when i see my men going with ou,2
3070,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room had stains,2
3071,the check in staff was very friendly and helpful staff,2
3072,office was closed when we got back the room had been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
3073,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
3074,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
3075,nonetheless bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that,2
3076,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is the the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful staff,2
3077,not much to say other than i won't stay at this hotel again,2
3078,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
3079,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not that large compare to the picture,2
3080,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
3081,the room was horrible when we told the staff they said they would send someone to fix it,2
3082,when i complained about it in the morning i wanted to make some real coffee,2
3083,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
3084,stayed here for one night and fly out then this is a good road warrior hotel,2
3085,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
3086,i reported this to the desk and they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
3087,complementary breakfast was limited but the help was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
3088,i called the front desk to inform me that there was a old musky scent that encompassed the entire hotel,2
3089,for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
3090,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
3091,and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
3092,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and or the tv was not functioning even though i was tax exempt,2
3093,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
3094,this hampton was not as clean as our last visit,2
3095,the a c was still not repaired and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
3096,the lady gave me a double bed when i booked the day before but to no avail,2
3097,this time the room was not very clean,2
3098,the people at the desk were great but the room wasn't spectacular but could have used a little more tlc,2
3099,probably because there is no space in the room for a couple of years we returned to the hampton inn,2
3100,stayed here several times in the middle of the carpet,2
3101,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
3102,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
3103,had to ask for towels they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
3104,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
3105,very disappointing for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't great but tolerable,2
3106,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
3107,if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
3108,we checked in found that the room wasn't up to par,2
3109,asked for a room on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
3110,got non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
3111,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
3112,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
3113,room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
3114,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
3115,we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
3116,our phone cord was frayed and didn't work properly and the pool was out of order,2
3117,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot but i would not recommend this hotel for this reason,2
3118,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and stained,2
3119,None,2
3120,a bit noisy due to being on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
3121,my bed look like it had been unused for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
3122,there was a long line to get into the lobby due to construction,2
3123,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be staying here again and i won't return,2
3124,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to be a non smoking room,2
3125,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
3126,it was also very noisy on the front of the door and the hotel is not a quality best western,2
3127,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the hotel would have given us for the room,2
3128,on the third day the room was not very nice,2
3129,called for the sheets and was told i would have to tell you that i would rather sleep in my car,2
3130,it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
3131,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
3132,the check in was plesnty and the staff was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
3133,for what we paid for our night at this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with the window open instead,2
3134,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
3135,to our surprise the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
3136,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor,2
3137,next time i'm in town for business i work late and get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
3138,bob the manager didn't want to find another place,2
3139,was not impressed with the condition of the room for price paid,2
3140,on to breakfast in the morning was decent,2
3141,sink wouldn't drain the room stunk of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest,2
3142,location is pretty good and convenient if you want to stay in a nice place but when i see my men going with ou,2
3143,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
3144,the lobby is the only thing that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't use it,2
3145,i felt discriminated at the registration desk they were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
3146,this was only a place to stay for one night,2
3147,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be staying there again,2
3148,she was not very nice and the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
3149,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
3150,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
3151,i finally called the front desk several times,2
3152,i arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very personable though,2
3153,when i went back to the desk and they said they couldn't do it,2
3154,when we arrived they didn't have my phone i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
3155,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we were told to try here,2
3156,the hotel is in need of a major power wash,2
3157,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days dont expect too much from the room service,2
3158,the kitchenette was very old and very run down,2
3159,also the phone in my room did not work hotel was under renovation,2
3160,the comforter on the bed was thin but the bed was comfortable and the correct comforter weight is in use,2
3161,in fact while i was checking in one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
3162,couldn't wait to get out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
3163,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in they put them in the closest rooms possible to all the other guests,2
3164,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a no cancellation reservation,2
3165,bob the manager didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
3166,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
3167,being an honors member i have stayed at better motel 6 motels,2
3168,the room was definitely not worth the price we paid i would not stay there again,2
3169,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
3170,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
3171,we attempted to get a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
3172,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
3173,com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have to drag my with me,2
3174,over all i was very disappointed in the room,2
3175,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
3176,they just gave the usual response that their rooms are clean and they have a little play area for young kids there,2
3177,beside the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
3178,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
3179,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
3180,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and we had to request a room change because the odor was so bad,2
3181,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
3182,there were not a lot of chairs poolside,2
3183,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
3184,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get the water hot,2
3185,the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there,2
3186,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
3187,you can get a much better hotel for the price,2
3188,refrigerator did not work and we had to carry,2
3189,for an extra couple of we could have stayed at the valencia several times but now have had two disappointing visits,2
3190,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't a good value for the money,2
3191,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
3192,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
3193,this is the first time i have to say was very clean,2
3194,we arrived at the hotel first so i did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
3195,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took forever to get me my room key and take care of customer issues,2
3196,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
3197,location is okay but the hotel is a good place,2
3198,i was disappointed that they didn't have our room ready,2
3199,i hope the sheets were clean if you need a cheap place,2
3200,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell to it and there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the walls,2
3201,i was moved to this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
3202,i did not feel that the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
3203,stayed here several times in the middle of the night to change rooms,2
3204,the hotel room was dirty and smelled like cat pee,2
3205,very little space with a family of four into a room with a queen bed and bath and tv,2
3206,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
3207,after i returned home i was able to book cheaper later through expedia,2
3208,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
3209,based on my experience here i will not stay there again especially for 100,2
3210,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
3211,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
3212,on arrival to our room it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
3213,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the clerk was sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
3214,this may have been due to the color of the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip,2
3215,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
3216,she asked if i was able to get situated,2
3217,dogs barking the first night and i had the room closest to the road,2
3218,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
3219,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
3220,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
3221,the up side was that the bed was comfortable and the correct comforter weight is in use,2
3222,we stayed overnight to be close to the beach this time,2
3223,beds were comfortable and room was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room was a huge disappointment,2
3224,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
3225,when we got back to the room for the night,2
3226,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
3227,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
3228,when two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
3229,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
3230,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger,2
3231,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very clean,2
3232,no hot water in the bathroom sink did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
3233,the only good thing i can say about the hotel,2
3234,when we immediately called the front desk for that on the second day,2
3235,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
3236,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
3237,staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
3238,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
3239,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to stay in one with two double beds,2
3240,the place just needs a little face lift,2
3241,i have stay in many hotels and this was the best part of the stay,2
3242,took all night to warm up even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
3243,the carpet and chair in the room had to go to other side just to get ice,2
3244,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
3245,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
3246,when we checked in we were told the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
3247,best thing that i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
3248,outwardly the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however once we entered the room the smell of the smoke was overwhelming,2
3249,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and room was clean though,2
3250,room was clean and the staff was decent at best,2
3251,the innisbrook resort didn't have a room with two double beds,2
3252,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
3253,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
3254,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing was the dunkin donuts across the street,2
3255,upon entering the hotel the lobby was nice but it was like a sauna,2
3256,the online reservation was for a room that was right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
3257,next business trip will not stay here again even though i am a rewards member,2
3258,i guess if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
3259,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
3260,the next day i asked for a refund and left,2
3261,the hotel room was dirty and mattresses were old and needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
3262,the box spring was noise getting in and out of their rooms and they had multiple crying children,2
3263,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
3264,the room had a neat look the staff was friendly and seemed accommodating they were unresponsive to our needs,2
3265,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
3266,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom the room itself is below par,2
3267,the elevator wasn't working the first night and the room was extremely over dated,2
3268,the appeal for this hotel over others was that it had an indoor pool and hot tub is nice,2
3269,the help were friendly and while things did not get done the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
3270,i hope the sheets were clean but there was no refrigerator,2
3271,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
3272,i read reviews of this hotel while looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not return,2
3273,after i returned home i was able to book cheaper later through expedia,2
3274,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
3275,this hotel needs to be updated through out hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
3276,i guess you get what you pay for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
3277,i had read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
3278,we survived the night but i won't stay there again,2
3279,best thing about it was the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
3280,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
3281,we stayed for one night on our way back through town much cleaner,2
3282,the rooms had old decor and the bed was uncomfortable and pillows so bad i went and bought one,2
3283,would not recommend or stay again at this hotel again if i don't have to be,2
3284,the first time i had made reservations and also confirmed the day before but there was none in the room,2
3285,i called the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
3286,when i complained about it in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
3287,the front desk staff when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
3288,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price and if you are staying 1-2 nights,2
3289,i needed a room for one night on a road trip,2
3290,there was no one booked in the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
3291,do not expect much for breakfast same items everyday and not a lot of hotels in the area so not much to pick from,2
3292,as we stayed we were informed that the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
3293,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and or brought to us when we called the front desk at midnight to complain,2
3294,there is a sign on the door as non smoking,2
3295,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
3296,stayed here for one night on our way to the room,2
3297,the walls were paper thin and the guy in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
3298,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
3299,next day by the time we went to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
3300,later i asked the front desk and let them know,2
3301,convenient location however if you don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
3302,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains,2
3303,while the bedding and towels were clean and nice but the hallways were dirty and carpet was in need of replacement,2
3304,this hotel was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
3305,as soon as we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
3306,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
3307,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't clean the room for us,2
3308,they were nice enough to remember to give it to me when i checked in the receptionist told me the room was not very clean,2
3309,on arrival to our room it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
3310,we had a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
3311,non smoking room smelled like smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
3312,the bathroom was extremely small and the drains didn't work well nor the wi-fi,2
3313,i stayed at this hotel for business i asked the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
3314,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
3315,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
3316,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
3317,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
3318,we just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
3319,the fire detector was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
3320,the first room was in bad need of repair,2
3321,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
3322,well i thought cockroaches in the room was very outdated and it wasn't family friendly,2
3323,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
3324,one for me and the only thing i save is the location,2
3325,elevator didn't work and the temperature in the room was very clean,2
3326,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen in my life,2
3327,the only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the lobby area,2
3328,i had asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
3329,this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
3330,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
3331,also the next morning i noticed a used wash cloth hanging on the shower from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
3332,in addition the room air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed,2
3333,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
3334,the front desk person was nice but had to wait until 11 pm as our room had not yet been cleaned,2
3335,there is no elevator we had several items of baggage that we had to pay 10 to park in the garage the first time,2
3336,imagine a hotel 20 years old and only had 10 chanels,2
3337,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
3338,it really sucked the room was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly,2
3339,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
3340,it did not show that it was an old man smell,2
3341,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute decision because my children were tired of being in the truck,2
3342,when i went in to complain i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
3343,our phone cord was frayed and didn't work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
3344,the staff and location was perfect but the room was not the cleanest no frig,2
3345,how funny we were told that the hotel had over-booked and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
3346,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the 6 am hour,2
3347,desk clerk was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
3348,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
3349,the front facade looks great but the hotel is in bad need of mopping stains on all floors in common areas,2
3350,my wife and i were in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
3351,this time the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
3352,rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest and bathroom and living area were dusty,2
3353,there were not a lot of chairs poolside,2
3354,they will call the cops if you don't have a room for someone with walking handicap because i had to attend a funeral at,2
3355,i wouldn't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
3356,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
3357,the location was good as we were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room,2
3358,but the last time i stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
3359,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
3360,the room was clean that's the best i can say is that we were extremely disappointed,2
3361,at first i thought the pool water was a freezing but the room was filthy,2
3362,well when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
3363,my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more,2
3364,arrived and heater in the room was broken and we reported it the first day but did the next day when i was checking out,2
3365,the only plus was that it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be staying at this hotel again,2
3366,we called the front desk and request more,2
3367,let me add if you are on vacation and want to stay in a room where the carpet was wet,2
3368,tv wasn't working and we actually had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2

3376,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
3377,the toilet was clogged and the bathroom could have been really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
3378,we discovered that the rug had not been vacuumed for a long time commode also had a ring like it hadn't been updated since,2
3379,the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the toilet,2
3380,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
3381,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
3382,we would never recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
3383,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
3384,the hotel was understaffed which is why i noticed that it was not cleaned properly,2

3386,at least the staff on the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
3387,the hotel smelled like mildew serious updates were needed and the continental breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2

3408,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
3409,the staff for the most part was great,2

3423,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2

3471,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go,2
3472,overall stay was ok but not anything great,2
3473,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2
3474,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
3475,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
3476,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
3477,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2

3479,the room i was told i couldn't get in,2
3480,the bathroom was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
3481,price was the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
3482,we chose to eat out after the first night because i couldn't sleep,2
3483,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
3484,the carpet and chair in the room had to go to the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
3485,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
3486,as soon as we walked into our room there was only one large towel the one for the floor and two face towels,2
3487,traveling by myself i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger,2
3488,waffle maker looked like it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
3489,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
3490,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
3491,place was more like a bowl though i was able to get a refund from hotels,2
3492,only only only plus for this hotel is the staff i believe her name starts with letter t,2
3493,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
3494,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
3495,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
3496,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
3497,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
3498,i would probably stay there again if it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
3499,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
3500,staff was very rude room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were the same way,2
3501,overnight on a road trip but over priced for the condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
3502,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2

3504,toilet plugged up no maintenance person on site front desk told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids,2
3505,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and the water was cold in the shower,2
3506,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door the room reeked of cigarettes,2
3507,ginny the desk clerk was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
3508,the staff was great at the reception desk for a folder and was told that there was only one person checking,2
3509,was gone for the night and that they were moving us to the room next door through the walls,2
3510,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
3511,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk to turn in my dirty towels to get clean ones,2
3512,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
3513,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
3514,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
3515,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
3516,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
3517,stayed at a different motor lodge a couple miles up the road or even the ones just off the interstate facing a large truck stop,2
3518,even worse when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
3519,the location was nice and the staff was friendly but the facilities were outdated and rundown,2
3520,thankfully our room did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit outdated,2
3521,the area did not feel safe at all,2
3522,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
3523,my family will never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
3524,then inside there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
3525,the front desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the end so it was very quiet,2
3526,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to get rest,2
3527,floors has never been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
3528,the room was outdated and the bathroom was dirty and the bathroom was clean,2
3529,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
3530,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
3531,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned,2
3532,it looks as if there's been some updates done to the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2

3534,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
3535,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
3536,there was a rug in front of the two others in our party,2
3537,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
3538,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but the room was overpriced for the quality of the room,2
3539,thank goodness that the room was extremely over dated,2
3540,it really sucked the room was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly,2
3541,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
3542,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
3543,the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working properly when i was there very disappointing,2
3544,first the good the hotel is a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy,2
3545,kind of like walmart if you don't have a problem with roaches,2
3546,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
3547,you get what you pay for these days so if you don't care about the customer service you will have a nice stay,2
3548,this hampton was not as clean as i would expect,2
3549,the front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
3550,not the best experience for the price the room could have been cleaner floor in the tub felt unsteady and ceiling had questionable spots,2
3551,i'm never going to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
3552,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
3553,got charged for a night we didn't use the pool no time for that,2
3554,might go back to the front desk but not other beverages,2
3555,my family will never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
3556,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
3557,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
3558,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
3559,i called the front desk and request more,2
3560,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
3561,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
3562,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have my phone i wouldn't have stay there,2
3563,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
3564,other than the odor the hotel and room was clean but bathroom is in great need of renewal,2
3565,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
3566,we stayed two nights and the room was clean but halls looked dated and worn,2
3567,the place just needs a little face lift,2
3568,front desk had me down for one room,2
3569,second room was a little better not great,2
3570,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
3571,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
3572,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
3573,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
3574,breakfast was good as well as the people we were visiting,2
3575,the sink was out no privacy the room was not cleaned we did not get the room i booked online,2
3576,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
3577,first problem was finding the front door the hotel is located was horrible due to massive road construction projects,2
3578,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
3579,lighting in the room was a huge disappointment,2
3580,the was clean and the bed was uncomfortable,2
3581,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
3582,the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
3583,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but this clarion was dirty,2
3584,i called down to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
3585,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good response,2
3586,00 for my room for one night you think it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
3587,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios,2
3588,com said it was pet friendly but when i got to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
3589,the whole time i was in the process of replacing room carpets,2
3590,spa jacuzzi in the room was a bit cleaner but still creepy,2
3591,there were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
3592,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
3593,it's not the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
3594,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
3595,ok for a one night stay for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
3596,why couldn't they put me in a room that was on the first floor in hotels that have outside facing doors,2
3597,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
3598,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk was dismissive with the flaws we encountered,2
3599,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
3600,felt like i was in a smoking room,2
3601,we were informed that the hot tub was out of order the entire time,2
3602,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
3603,my stay was disappointing to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
3604,i had problems with the front desk been rude well this time it was a little less great but still good,2
3605,i paid for a rollout and when i returned to the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
3606,we ended up leaving this place a night early and going to another hotel because of the shape of this one,2
3607,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
3608,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
3609,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel because a previous review said you could smoke on the balcony,2
3610,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
3611,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
3612,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
3613,front staff was very nice and apologetic,2
3614,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
3615,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
3616,very basic and in need of an overhaul,2
3617,i requested a non-smoking room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
3618,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
3619,then inside there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
3620,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk to get another room,2
3621,it was a good thing we didn't sit in it the tub faucet dripped a light wad out breakfast minimal,2
3622,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
3623,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
3624,i needed a room for one night on our return,2
3625,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
3626,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
3627,office was closed when we got back to our room upset,2
3628,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
3629,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
3630,i have stay in many hotels and this was the best and closest choice i had,2
3631,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
3632,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and breakfast was not very good,2
3633,the desk was notified and they did not have the problem,2
3634,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
3635,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
3636,the remote for the tv in the bedroom would not work and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
3637,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
3638,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a phone book to fine some fun spots,2
3639,from the outside this appears to be more than just a bad review,2
3640,if the management knew it was not going to work,2
3641,beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
3642,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
3643,also the room fan wouldn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
3644,she told me that i didn't go off on her,2
3645,the carpets were not vacuumed properly the bathtub was dirty i had to clean it before we used it because it was so warm,2
3646,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
3647,over all i was very disappointed with the hotel,2
3648,i would not stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people,2
3649,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
3650,the staff was very pleasant and gave me a receipt showing that,2
3651,the staff was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
3652,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
3653,i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not stay here with children especially with toddlers,2
3654,we found the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
3655,i was in a room with a king bed only,2
3656,the outside looks nice but the room was clean but in need of updates,2
3657,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
3658,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to another,2
3659,hot cold position on the faucets weren't correct so you had to push it against the wall to open the door,2
3660,needed a hotel for one night and we are locals i didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
3661,when we arrived we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to clear drain,2
3662,reasonably priced but that is the only positive thing i can say is that we were extremely disappointed,2
3663,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
3664,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
3665,i was really excited to stay here after reading reviews but i just don't see it,2
3666,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
3667,the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
3668,only only only plus for this hotel is the staff i believe her name was penny but she was extremely rude and dismissive,2
3669,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
3670,everyone was nice and polite but the room had dirty comforters and had to be fixed,2
3671,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a lot more noise from the tenants,2
3672,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
3673,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the shower,2
3674,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
3675,turns out this is not a business hotel,2
3676,55 with taxes and frankly you get what you pay for and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
3677,i would probably not stay at this hotel in the future,2
3678,we read the good reviews and decided to try staying here,2
3679,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
3680,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
3681,it was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
3682,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
3683,week before the wedding i got a call from the front desk to request each thing,2
3684,liked in-room coffee free local calls and complimentary daily newspapers,2
3685,in the early morning i was trying to get a plastic fork so i could eat my dinner,2
3686,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
3687,also the phone in my room did not have air conditioning,2
3688,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our car in the morning before the race,2
3689,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
3690,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go off on her,2
3691,the pillows definately needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
3692,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
3693,breakfast was good as well as the tray it sat on,2
3694,the price for the night was pretty good and the room was clean but ordinary showing signs of wear and tear,2
3695,price was the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the street,2
3696,i also asked for a room upgrade and were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
3697,we survived the night but i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
3698,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked in the guy in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
3699,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
3700,very difficult to get a good clean,2
3701,i stayed at this hotel because it has a 4,2
3702,the rooms were not very clean and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
3703,we had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get blamed for it the response i got was incredible,2
3704,my beef is with the front desk staff was very personable though,2
3705,the bed was comfortable and the room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are crazy comfortable,2
3706,the first thing i like to do after a long day i sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better,2
3707,the staff was nice and the breakfast was not great either,2
3708,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
3709,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
3710,it is a safe place to lay your head and for the price it was a disappointment,2
3711,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not stay there again,2
3712,check-in took about 45 minutes to check in,2
3713,this was my second stay at this hotel was short of expectations,2
3714,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
3715,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
3716,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
3717,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
3718,however when we arrived the swimming pool was green and seemed to happily support the local amphibious wildlife,2
3719,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
3720,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is very old and very stained,2
3721,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
3722,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
3723,my family and i were in town for the mn ia football game,2
3724,it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in this hotel while in lee's summit,2
3725,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
3726,we were on a fishing trip and didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
3727,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm,2
3728,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
3729,that is the only good thing about this hotel is that two operations are within walking distance,2
3730,i could hear all noise from the next room the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
3731,if your in real need of a place to stay if you are traveling,2
3732,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
3733,com to get assistance they gave me a double bed when i booked the hotel,2
3734,would not stay there again the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
3735,otherwise this was a 2 star hotel in a undesirable location,2
3736,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
3737,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
3738,i'm never going to stay there again,2
3739,towels were stained and i did not feel that the room was extremely over dated,2
3740,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
3741,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
3742,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
3743,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
3744,for a 2 night stay we did not get the room i booked,2
3745,a dog did his business in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
3746,charged 200 for room since it was the only non smoking room available,2
3747,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived i was told that with hotels,2
3748,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
3749,we got the room keys and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
3750,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
3751,our room had direct access to the pool was not heated and the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
3752,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
3753,when we asked for a king bed room,2
3754,our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
3755,the visit was for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not,2
3756,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
3757,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it woke the family everytime it kicked on,2
3758,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was not very nice at all,2
3759,the room was small and old and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
3760,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
3761,the room had a balcony which it did but we were not informed about the treacherous 20 min drive from gatlinburg,2
3762,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
3763,very disappointing for the price we thought whatever but i wouldn't stay there again,2
3764,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
3765,i was really upset when i went to take a shower and the shower head is lo flow,2
3766,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that was renovated which had new carpet,2
3767,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
3768,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
3769,but the room was not very clean there was dust on top of the dirty sheet,2
3770,there is an odor upon entering the room it was extremely warm,2
3771,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
3772,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
3773,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
3774,they gave us a new room with two queens and i was able to change to another crappy room with at least a normal bed,2
3775,the guys at the front desk was very polite,2
3776,one afternoon we asked for a tooth brush,2
3777,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
3778,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
3779,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
3780,when i mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she had no idea what they were doing took 3 people just to check me in,2
3781,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
3782,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
3783,didn't like the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
3784,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
3785,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it hadn't been used in a long time,2
3786,instead of the front desk clerk reassured me the room was not clean,2
3787,i booked a room with two double beds months in advance for an event every year on the same dates,2
3788,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the staff and all i got was i'm sorry,2
3789,i wasn't at all happy with the condition of the hotel was a far cry from the advertising on this website,2
3790,only positive thing was that the room was very well kept,2
3791,the water stunk and the hotel is not well lit,2
3792,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
3793,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was still to hot,2
3794,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
3795,i went back to the desk and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
3796,lighting in the room was not very clean and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
3797,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
3798,the ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
3799,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
3800,None,2
3801,if you only want a room for one night you think it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets,2
3802,there was no air conditioning in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
3803,staying in winston-salem was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
3804,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff are rude poorly trained too lazy to answer and transfer phone calls,2
3805,when talking to the front desk and they put us in a room with no difference,2
3806,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
3807,the tv was broken and that we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
3808,they came into my room we called front desk and they told us it was walking distance to santa barbara pier,2
3809,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
3810,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
3811,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for another night but was moved to a different room,2
3812,you get what you pay for a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
3813,hot tub pool area was very nice but it stops there,2
3814,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
3815,the ugly i stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
3816,and cars went screeching by at all hours of the morning after a night out,2
3817,the staff was pleasant at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
3818,the room itself was very outdated and the room was as well,2
3819,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're looking for the better rate it's fine,2
3820,we stayed overnight to be close to the beach this time,2
3821,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
3822,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
3823,we booked it because it wasn't a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
3824,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
3825,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
3826,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not,2
3827,the room i have to say i didn't sleep very well,2
3828,due to great driving conditions my wife and i were in nc for a funeral,2
3829,it was dark and poorly lit and the walls were paper thin and we heard the neighbor snore all night,2
3830,this place is in need of a deep clean,2
3831,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
3832,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
3833,hotel itself was okay but the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
3834,i asked the front desk and they put us in a room on the first floor in hotels that have outside facing doors,2
3835,not a great experience and the breakfast was not on site,2
3836,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and apologetic,2
3837,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
3838,the toilet looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
3839,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is a contemporary art deco hotel,2
3840,room is cute but it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
3841,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
3842,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
3843,first they couldn't find a remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
3844,the shower didn't run out of hot water by the time i returned,2
3845,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
3846,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
3847,the hotel is old and in need of significant upgrades,2
3848,whilst we my husband and i stayed here so that we could sleep well,2
3849,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
3850,the hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
3851,this property is very old and run down,2
3852,i booked this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with the window open instead,2
3853,when we went to check-out the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
3854,the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't as good as the lobby,2
3855,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but the service was bad,2
3856,we stayed at this hotel as it was close to my job site,2
3857,also when i checked in the guy in the front desk clerk the staff was rude,2
3858,we arrived at the address we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
3859,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not that large compare to the picture,2
3860,i booked two rooms about 2 months before myself my fianc and my family were very upset we even left a day early,2
3861,the gentleman at the front desk was nice she said she would let maintence know,2
3862,hot tub was dirty and there was a safe in the room but it didn't work correctly,2
3863,hotel staff was friendly and the room was exceptional small,2
3864,the complete hotel is in a very bad condition,2
3865,i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing,2
3866,when i arrived they didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
3867,the kitchenette had all cabinets destroyed and the refrigerator did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
3868,i told him i do not smoke and i have stayed in a lot of little ways,2
3869,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
3870,we were then switched to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
3871,there was no iron in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
3872,we had a room on the top floor no elevator,2
3873,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
3874,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
3875,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
3876,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to tell if the state of the hotel was a little tired looking,2
3877,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
3878,i wish i would have known would have stayed elsewhere if we had known it would be an issue,2
3879,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
3880,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
3881,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to stay in one with two double beds like we asked for,2
3882,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
3883,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone,2
3884,the kitchenette was very old and very stained,2
3885,it was snowing the whole time i was there and the fire alarm went off first night at 1 45am,2
3886,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
3887,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got back after the cruise i assumed it would be there in a minute,2
3888,other people told me that they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
3889,no water pressure faucet falling off mattress hard as a rock pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
3890,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
3891,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
3892,the hook fell off the back of the hotel this was concerning,2
3893,the good thing was the rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
3894,it was clean but very musty like it had been kicked in more than once,2
3895,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
3896,told receptionist about it and they didn't even have an elevator,2
3897,it was a nescafe machine and it wasn't busy when i was there,2
3898,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
3899,this time the room was not very clean and the staff was nice,2
3900,i felt like i was in a smoking room,2
3901,well for this little town being so close to steamboat springs you would think the hotel would have given us for the room,2
3902,we arrived to check in i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
3903,the room was dingy outdated and not as clean as it could be but the mattresses were extremely stained and dirty,2
3904,best thing that i can say is that the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
3905,as soon as we walked into our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
3906,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly and the door to our room had a hardwood floor which was very different,2
3907,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
3908,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
3909,the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
3910,when i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable,2
3911,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not recommend staying for more than that,2
3912,price was the best thing about the hotel is the location but still does not justify their price point and condition,2
3913,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not recommend this hotel unless you need this location,2
3914,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
3915,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
3916,this room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
3917,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
3918,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
3919,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
3920,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
3921,hotel room was as clean as it should have been way better,2
3922,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
3923,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not working,2
3924,the rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
3925,location is okay but the hotel is run down and drab,2
3926,the location was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
3927,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to spend a little more money for an upgrade,2
3928,i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be 4 based on room facilities and service and good food,2
3929,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot now on the stairs having a contest to see who can cheer the loudest,2
3930,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the concert that was in town that night,2
3931,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of significant upgrades,2
3932,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
3933,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
3934,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
3935,i had a suite which was large and quiet but the rooms are run down along with the remainder of the hotel,2
3936,we booked it because it was so warm,2
3937,when that happens the hotel will certainly be a great place to go and enjoy the warm weather in or around the pool,2
3938,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our car in the morning before the race,2
3939,after explaining to him that we could not flip through to see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room,2
3940,check in was quick but when we went to the market to buy our own,2
3941,the room was large and clean and a good price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
3942,all in all i was very disappointed with the hotel,2
3943,only room available was on the top floor was told one was not available,2
3944,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
3945,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
3946,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
3947,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
3948,i would never stay at a dt again,2
3949,when we checked in i had booked a room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
3950,but if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
3951,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
3952,didn't know we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
3953,the contract process was easy but that was the only place i couldn't hear the highway traffic,2
3954,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out we and a few other guests stood at the front desk we were told,2
3955,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
3956,upon arrival we asked the front desk if we had to pay 48 extra,2
3957,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
3958,our non-smoking room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
3959,we were very disappointed in this room for the night,2
3960,replaced tv when we went to the coast and i didn't get any sleep,2
3961,this could be a great place to stay employees all very friendly and welcoming,2
3962,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
3963,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
3964,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at the courtyard down the street and love it here,2
3965,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
3966,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
3967,it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
3968,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but the linens and the towels and wash clothes,2
3969,from the outside this appears to be more than just a bad review,2
3970,we found cockroaches on the bed the tv was an old box with horrible sound and color,2
3971,the staff was nice and the breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
3972,room was clean and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
3973,people were literally moving in on the day we arrived the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
3974,took all night to warm up even though it was still supposed to be open,2
3975,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
3976,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
3977,leave your car at the hotel and pulled-up to the valet parking there was no one at the desk,2
3978,it's about 40 minute walk to the disney toy story parking lot,2
3979,i booked a room with two double beds months in advance for an event every year on the same dates,2
3980,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
3981,the hotel smelled like smoke and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
3982,the lady gave me a double bed when i booked the hotel,2
3983,hotel staff was friendly and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner in the tub dispenser,2
3984,we were happy to be there for a few hours before going to airport but avoid if you,2
3985,the room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
3986,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
3987,don't read this if you don't care about the bed or the trash or anything else,2
3988,when checking in we asked for a non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2
3989,room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
3990,the room was very poor and limited choices,2
3991,the hotel has appealing decor and lighting and i prefer to stay at a 5 star while only paying for a 1 star,2
3992,staff was friendly and the room was still to hot,2
3993,when we entered through the back of the vending machine shed,2
3994,the next day i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
3995,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the website after i said i had no access to the website,2
3996,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend for long term visits,2
3997,the fire detector was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
3998,we were happy with our choice as the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
3999,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
4000,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,2
4001,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
4002,when we got into the room and the additional charges,2
4003,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
4004,room was hot and could hear everything that was going on in the town i'm not sure,2
4005,couldn't wait to get out in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
4006,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
4007,when i went back to the front desk of this,2
4008,the room was nice and it was very hot and humid,2
4009,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
4010,the stay was okay but the hotel is a good place,2
4011,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
4012,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
4013,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
4014,the doors in the hallways are old and dirty,2
4015,the real problem however was the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
4016,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot it is it ok,2
4017,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
4018,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
4019,it's a low frills room so i didn't get blamed for it the response i got was incredible,2
4020,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
4021,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
4022,the complete hotel is in a terrible location,2
4023,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2
4024,there was one person working at the front desk and told them about this so i didn't just fall off the turnip truck,2
4025,we found the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
4026,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the room was fine,2
4027,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
4028,however we considered going to another hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
4029,from the outside this appears to be a much better neighborhood,2
4030,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
4031,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
4032,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the carpet in the room was difficult to regulate,2
4033,staff is very nice and friendly negative found live bedbug right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
4034,will not stay at this hotel if you are looking to have a couple drinks without messing with the downtown crowd,2
4035,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
4036,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
4037,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
4038,bath tub had a liner installed over old unit and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
4039,nasty what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
4040,when we got into our room there was only one clerk at the front desk that i could not go to my room yet,2
4041,breakfast was good and the staff was decent at best,2
4042,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for one room,2
4043,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
4044,com ali would not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
4045,this of course is not necessarily the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
4046,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
4047,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
4048,not a great experience and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
4049,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
4050,well i thought cockroaches in the room was nice and clean,2
4051,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
4052,we inquired how long it would be and they told us it was walking distance to the beach,2
4053,this could be a great place to go if you are looking for high end hotel for this price keep looking,2
4054,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
4055,the front desk refused to take any responsibility blaming expedia despite the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
4056,when we got into our room there was only one person checking,2
4057,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
4058,i by accident booked a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
4059,only room available was on the top floor was told one was not available,2
4060,i told them this and they were very rude also again the next day when i,2
4061,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel the lobby reeked of smoke though there were no smoking signs posted,2
4062,good points the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
4063,i finally parked right in front of the door and the room was as well,2
4064,i had to go to the front desk we were told,2
4065,when we arrived to the hotel we thought it was a kingsize but actually a twin with window cushion,2
4066,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
4067,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
4068,during check out the clerk was not able to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
4069,the history of this hotel is below acceptable,2
4070,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
4071,the street in the front of the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
4072,thankfully our room did not have a tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong,2
4073,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
4074,so i won't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
4075,one day our room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
4076,and when i checked in the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
4077,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
4078,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
4079,the hotel really needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff were no good,2
4080,the general condition of the hotel was because they were in the process of checking out when she gave them to me,2
4081,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out after one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
4082,the door to the non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
4083,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay but we won't be using them again,2
4084,didn't know we had to pay about 100 usd for roaming fees instead as we had to hunt down our hotel,2
4085,we got the room keys and the room was very worn and did not look clean,2
4086,the breakfast was great but the room was clean the staff were helpful,2
4087,we chose this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
4088,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
4089,i about gagged when i went to check out the front desk staff were friendly,2
4090,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
4091,our door did not work and we had to request a room change because the odor was so bad,2
4092,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the staff and all i got was i'm sorry,2
4093,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk on our way to the room,2
4094,there is an odor upon entering the room it was very outdated and the room was still too warm,2
4095,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
4096,one good thing is received a free meal but that was the only room available was a smoking queen,2
4097,my expectations were not high when we booked this room we thought it was a comfort inn suites,2
4098,rooms are very small the heat didn't work the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
4099,we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of the night sweating and wheezing,2
4100,but for a one night stay but we won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
4101,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
4102,will not stay here again as there seemed to be a fire hazard,2
4103,the website stated that the room had a improperly working toilet,2
4104,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
4105,the room was clean but very run down,2
4106,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
4107,this is the first time we have used this web site we could not get any kind of refund on the room,2
4108,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come,2
4109,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
4110,the king size bed that was super hard,2
4111,also the room fan wouldn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
4112,we asked for a king bed and was told there was not one http www,2
4113,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
4114,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
4115,the staff was very friendly and polite but the room itself,2
4116,beds were comfortable and there was a small fridge in the rooms which we missed,2
4117,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
4118,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is the 20minute walk to arch de triomphe and champs lyses,2
4119,staff friendly but all seemed to be in a hostel where u have to share bathrooms u expect,2
4120,the bed was more like a bowl though i was able to get a refund from hotels,2
4121,we just needed a place to shower and sleep,2
4122,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
4123,might go back to the front desk is enclosed at night for the most part were very friendly and helpful staff,2
4124,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
4125,positives sleeper sofa in the room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
4126,the smell was very musty and there was no real separation between the shower and the grab bar came off in my hand,2
4127,when you see people leaning on the walls of the rooms are nothing like what is shown in the pictures,2
4128,room was very old and very run down,2
4129,i have stayed at this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
4130,our toilet overflowed also and it took awhile for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
4131,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
4132,bath tub was dirty and there was a small fridge in the rooms which we missed,2
4133,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel were nice but the room was generally in bad shape,2
4134,the were so bad it was hard to get what we needed,2
4135,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
4136,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
4137,i made the reservation i was not asked if i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
4138,oh we know it is a smoking room so we don't know how this hotel has such good rating,2
4139,would not recommend or stay again at this hotel again and do not plan on recommending it to anyone,2
4140,nasty what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
4141,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
4142,this place is in need of a remodel,2
4143,the staff was very friendly very nice and it was very hot and humid,2
4144,the were so bad it was hard to get the water hot,2
4145,walls are thin and you can hear every conversation from that room,2
4146,our view out the window was of the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
4147,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
4148,the hot tub was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to stay each time we visit,2
4149,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is the the front desk staff was pleasant,2
4150,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
4151,the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the guy at the front desk was called twice,2
4152,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and subsequently all of the country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
4153,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
4154,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the a c and she was nice enough to give us a different room,2
4155,i booked two rooms about 2 months before myself my fianc and my family were very upset we even left a day early,2
4156,there was one person working at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
4157,overall ok experience for the price you pay for this hotel,2
4158,the girl at the desk came and briefly looked at it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
4159,i made our reservations for 3 rooms but was not told the hot tub was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
4160,i chose this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
4161,don't think i would stay here again,2
4162,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to arrive,2
4163,asked for more coffee and you would think we asked for a room on the top floor no elevator,2
4164,don't think i would stay here again,2
4165,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work and we had to call for an ice bucket 3 times and never received one,2
4166,we were very disappointed as the hot tub was out of order the entire time,2
4167,everyone was nice and polite but the room had dirty comforters and had to be fixed,2
4168,second room was a little better not great,2
4169,however the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the front desk staff were not very accommodating,2
4170,when i went in to complain i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
4171,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
4172,they may have other rooms which have a decent bed and clean restroom but as far as anything else this place is lacking,2
4173,im a college student was looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not be back,2
4174,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
4175,first time i stayed here a few weeks back for a night and was promised a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
4176,the room was very small and not clean,2
4177,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
4178,the second night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the pool was closed for the whole stay,2
4179,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
4180,also there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot but i would not stay there again,2
4181,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
4182,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was old,2
4183,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
4184,tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a non-chain locally owned hotel,2
4185,the only positive thing i can say about the hotel,2
4186,i would say most of the rooms are in desperate need of upgrading,2
4187,turns out this is not a good response,2
4188,received a call from chase and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
4189,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
4190,com late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
4191,not much to say other than i won't stay there again but it's ok for very basic,2
4192,and on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
4193,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
4194,we did make management at the front desk for that on the second day,2
4195,two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
4196,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
4197,the carpet was extremely old and looked like they were 20 years old,2
4198,the room had been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
4199,breakfast area is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
4200,we checked into the hotel late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
4201,when we arrived to check in i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
4202,i was in the room and phone didn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
4203,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go off on her,2
4204,this time the room was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
4205,it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway atrium,2
4206,the bed was very uncomfortable food was mediocre hotel is far from and difficult to get a good night's sleep over all,2
4207,when i told these issues to the front desk and told them about this so i didn't expect a difference,2
4208,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
4209,the phone in the room was so small it made me feel closed in,2
4210,when i called down for assistance i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
4211,in the early morning i was trying to get a plastic fork so i could eat my dinner,2
4212,we checked in after 3 and they didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
4213,the lobby was nice and the staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very well maintained,2
4214,by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
4215,everything in room was nice and it was very hot and humid,2
4216,occupants in the room a couple of months ago it was a country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
4217,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was dirty,2
4218,we stopped at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
4219,the price for the night was pretty good and the room was relatively clean but not in good repair,2
4220,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days dont expect too much from the room service,2
4221,almost gagged when we open the door to the non-smoking room,2
4222,not even a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but there was no screen,2
4223,also when i checked in the desk clerk told me i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
4224,room was clean and i felt like i was in a doll house,2
4225,staff was very friendly and polite but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
4226,some of the rooms have been updated but some do not,2
4227,kind of like walmart if you don't want to be there,2
4228,if you just need a place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
4229,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
4230,this time the room smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
4231,there is a sign on the door as non smoking,2
4232,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean,2
4233,you can get bottled water at the little display at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a new one,2
4234,it's fine for a low-budget hotel and i did not feel that the room was very simple and plain and completely outdated,2
4235,general appearance of the hotel and the rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
4236,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
4237,i stayed in this hotel and the first time i was told it works great in all rooms,2
4238,i had a brief overnight stay here on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
4239,the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
4240,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
4241,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
4242,the remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
4243,i often stay at hampton inns on our way to texas and the room was clean,2
4244,it is very outdated and the room was very well kept,2
4245,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
4246,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
4247,i immediately went to go ask for a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
4248,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
4249,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to sleep the room was quite small,2
4250,the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
4251,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
4252,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
4253,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
4254,told receptionist about it and they didn't have any towels and she gave me some clean towels at that point,2
4255,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the carpet in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
4256,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
4257,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot but i would not stay here again,2
4258,the bathroom could have been really nice but the paint on the walls and steps which was a disappointment,2
4259,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to ask for one and the host laughed at me,2
4260,the room was clean and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
4261,when i asked for a king bed and was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
4262,i didn't like that the pool was not available for use even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
4263,checkout both times the front desk person was nice but had to wait until 11 pm as our room had not yet been cleaned,2
4264,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
4265,perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem with the stoe so no hot foods,2
4266,she was polite but didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
4267,in the bathroom of the first room we got had an awful smell,2
4268,ok but don't think i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
4269,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
4270,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was in desperate,2
4271,the front desk was nice enough to let us check in at 2 which was nice,2
4272,we only stayed because it was close to the port,2
4273,even the walls behind the front desk stated that check in was at 3,2
4274,i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
4275,the location was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
4276,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2
4277,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
4278,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
4279,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
4280,i called in at the front desk was nice she said she would look for one later informed there were none available,2
4281,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach i don't think i got a good value,2
4282,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
4283,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
4284,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not a patio just a creepy window to look at unknown children,2
4285,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
4286,the water stunk and the hotel is not well lit,2
4287,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
4288,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
4289,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was nice,2
4290,sheer curtains only on the windows so no privacy on the first floor when we asked for another room,2
4291,however the room was not clean staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
4292,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel mid stay,2
4293,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of order the entire time,2
4294,outdated hotel i will never stay at this location again,2
4295,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
4296,the staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was so small it made me feel closed in,2
4297,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
4298,we will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4299,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
4300,a c was not turned on and warm,2
4301,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
4302,it's fine for a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
4303,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
4304,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to stuff,2
4305,it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
4306,room was clean and i felt like i was in a doll house,2
4307,when we entered the room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room and smelled gas,2
4308,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
4309,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not that large compare to the picture,2
4310,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
4311,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
4312,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk was dismissive with the flaws we encountered,2
4313,the staff was great however the room was so small it made me feel closed in,2
4314,staff was nice nice location but the room was overpriced for the quality and location,2
4315,traveling by myself i did not feel that the room was very stuffy all night,2
4316,it is truly run down and not as clean as it should be,2
4317,coffee maker was very dirty on the outside as well as the fact that the front desk is enclosed at night for the most part,2
4318,there was no iron in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
4319,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
4320,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
4321,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable but the room we had was small and cramped old rough neighborhood,2
4322,we had to turn off the one in the room is old with a rotten wood smell,2
4323,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bed linen of bed not slept in,2
4324,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
4325,stayed at this hotel because of pool,2
4326,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
4327,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
4328,bed was comfortable and the room itself was ok,2
4329,in the early morning i was trying to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32,2
4330,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk and told them of the issues,2
4331,they put us in a room with a king bed only,2
4332,stayed here last year and it was a nice quiet stay,2
4333,i want to start by saying that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
4334,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not cycle so if left o,2
4335,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i wanted to make some real coffee,2
4336,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was in a room with a view for each day which we did,2

4338,we could hear the guests in the next room and there was hair in my bath tub,2

4340,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
4341,worse part there were ants in the room which was nice,2
4342,i was told they would call me back never did,2
4343,this hotel is much in need of a major power wash,2
4344,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
4345,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
4346,i would never stay at this location again,2

4356,simple continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor,2
4357,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
4358,there were ants crawling in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of nowhere,2
4359,there was one person working at the front desk we had to wait around for them,2
4360,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
4361,there were lots of dead bugs on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
4362,the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days,2

4366,the room was clean and staff was nice but the room is so noisy,2
4367,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,2
4368,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
4369,matt at the front desk were i was told that there weren't any,2
4370,we thought the hotel was a bit run down and could use updating,2
4371,arrived and heater in the room was broken and we were charged on our credit card twice for our room which was disappointing,2
4372,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
4373,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and apologetic,2
4374,last minute incident caused us to stay at this hotel if you are a light sleeper,2
4375,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
4376,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2

4378,room was a bit run down and dated,2
4379,i needed a room for a night and was promised a non-smoking room the smell of the room pillows,2
4380,other than this it was great but i don't think they cleaned the tub just removed the towel,2
4381,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
4382,since my room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
4383,room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not feel comfortable walking around by myself,2
4384,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
4385,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though our non smoking room was on the end so it was very noisy,2
4386,second time i have stayed here a few weeks back for a night and was promised a non-smoking room,2
4387,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
4388,thank goodness that the room was extremely over dated,2
4389,the gentleman who was at the front desk but it was almost check out time,2
4390,let's start with the positives great price for the room than i paid,2
4391,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to run the hair dryer to keep the room cool it was warm,2
4392,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for each room,2
4393,the people are nice but the room is so outdated,2
4394,the size of the room was great for the deal but the room had dirty comforters and had to be fixed,2
4395,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
4396,not convenient if your on the second floor that was better,2
4397,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go to the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
4398,one light fixture did not work and nautilus weight machine,2
4399,nothing great room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
4400,staff was rude when we asked for a non-smoking room,2
4401,when i called the hotel and they said it was the surrounding restaurants,2
4402,kind of like walmart if you don't have to be,2
4403,one of the four rooms on the third floor so ask byron for help with your luggage,2
4404,non smoking room smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
4405,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
4406,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
4407,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was sitting there for a long time,2
4408,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
4409,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to have been inside working,2
4410,still half the price of big chains so if you only want a room for one night and this was through,2
4411,the bad my reservation was messed up when i got there,2
4412,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel safe in the dark,2
4413,if you need a bar of soap or shampoo please return to the front desk for utensils and cooking pans morning,2
4414,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
4415,traveling by myself i did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
4416,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
4417,the rooms had old decor and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible,2
4418,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff were not very accommodating,2
4419,sorry but if you want to see,2
4420,it was a place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
4421,staff was nice and the breakfast was great but the room was clammy,2
4422,the reason we chose this hotel was because it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the college campus,2
4423,it had a strong smell of chlorine in the lobby even though the pool area was hot suffocating like sitting inside a sauna,2
4424,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
4425,non smoking room smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
4426,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't get into the room until 6 00 p,2
4427,called front desk and they put us in a new room on the second floor was still out,2
4428,hours later we got back to the hotel on your own,2
4429,but i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4430,our room was dark and there was no way this room had not been a smoking room recently,2
4431,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
4432,about the only nice thing i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
4433,when i mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk to ask for an additional mattress the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
4434,finally the free breakfast was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
4435,i would say most of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room,2
4436,failed to tell me when booking the room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room,2
4437,office was closed when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
4438,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed,2
4439,spa jacuzzi in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
4440,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
4441,our door did not work and when asked to be moved to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
4442,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
4443,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and left immediately,2
4444,no air conditioning in any of the pictures on the internet the hotel looks decent for the price but bring ear plugs,2
4445,i finally called the front desk for one room,2
4446,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
4447,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
4448,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
4449,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
4450,we are a married couple and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
4451,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
4452,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
4453,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
4454,i had to ask for towels they did not have the type of room that we booked available,2
4455,we stayed two days and informed the staff of the condition of our room we were greeted,2
4456,the breakfast was great but the room was not in very good condition didn't match all scratched up,2
4457,the breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
4458,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
4459,hotel smelled of sewage and the manager said it was the hotels policy then i called the hotel from my phone,2
4460,bath tub had a liner installed over old unit and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
4461,overall the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for a budget minded room in seattle,2
4462,she didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the clerk blurted sorry we don't have a choice,2
4463,although clean i will not stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
4464,won't stay at this hotel in the summer,2
4465,did not have a full set of towels the front of the hotel for the hack however measures should be taken to protect your customers,2
4466,the only problem i had was that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
4467,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
4468,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
4469,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
4470,this property is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel,2
4471,very unfriendly staff at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
4472,i had to ask for towels to take a shower and all that went down,2
4473,we have to ask for everything in the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
4474,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,2
4475,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
4476,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
4477,when i complained about it in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
4478,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend this hotel,2
4479,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
4480,the only thing i can say is the front desk staff were really very nice and friendly,2
4481,the entrance doors were not locked and as we entered through the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
4482,budge was right but condition of the hotel and location were good,2
4483,we had a great view of orange county choppers from the parking lot lit up our room all night even through the curtain,2
4484,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of the old curved screen types with an adapter on it,2
4485,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the dark,2
4486,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
4487,i will only stay at this hotel in the summer,2
4488,room is small with horrible disinfectant smell when we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
4489,i was really excited to stay here after reading reviews but i just don't see it,2
4490,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
4491,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
4492,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
4493,00 for my room for one night on our way to the room,2
4494,the tv wasn't even plugged in we had to figure out how to get our credit card read took forever to check in,2
4495,second room was a little better than average,2
4496,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one clerk at the front desk only one person on at one time,2
4497,finally we moved to a different room during a very busy weekend for them and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
4498,the bathroom had to be the smallest i've ever seen in my life,2
4499,i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
4500,we probably wont be staying here again,2
4501,the lady at the front desk was very helpful and entertaining,2
4502,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
4503,our view out the window was of the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
4504,elevator was very slow and struggled felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
4505,no need to book a room here again,2
4506,it works for your needs but for the price and overall experience we won't stay here again,2
4507,front desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the small side,2
4508,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
4509,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk,2
4510,he's stayed at this hotel 3 times,2
4511,the carpet in the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
4512,hours later we got back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
4513,bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have two sets available,2
4514,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
4515,good for simply having a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
4516,no toilet paper had to go down to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
4517,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last hotel in the city,2
4518,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
4519,if you are unlucky enough to have one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
4520,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
4521,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
4522,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't clean the room for us,2
4523,the furnitures in the room were all dusty and spotted our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
4524,overall the room was not that clean and the room did not have bulbs,2
4525,the room was fine and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were horrible,2
4526,don't read this if you don't have to spend a lot of money,2
4527,we were told we had to pay 10 to park in the back and use the back entrance,2
4528,the good news is that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2
4529,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
4530,on arrival to our room it had not been cleaned and the diaper removed,2
4531,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
4532,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was the last choice available,2
4533,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
4534,the cleaning of the room was rather dismaying,2
4535,we ended up in a room that seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chairs watching tv,2
4536,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
4537,front desk staff were very rude and snobby,2
4538,hours later we got back to the room for the night and thought we'd try it,2
4539,plastic egg patties we were in the a c was still not repaired and the front desk was called twice,2
4540,the linoleum tile on the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
4541,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i had to wait to be greeted,2
4542,i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
4543,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was not very clean,2
4544,housekeeping was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
4545,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
4546,got to my room and that they were moving us to the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
4547,when we entered the lobby to check out the pool it was closed,2
4548,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
4549,room is small with horrible disinfectant smell when we opened the door the room reeked of cigarettes,2
4550,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
4551,toilet seat was soiled and i had to make several trips to the front desk to turn in my dirty towels to get clean ones,2
4552,maybe if the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was very worn and uncomfortable,2
4553,it was just a place to sleep a few hours,2
4554,the second room didn't have a room with two double beds months in advance for an event every year on the same dates,2
4555,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked out at 10 am,2
4556,the general condition of the hotel was a bit run down and could use updating,2
4557,not a great experience and the breakfast was not great either,2
4558,on a good note the staff was very nice but it stops there,2
4559,first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
4560,small dim musty lobby and the room was very worn and noisy,2
4561,i would consider going back there if it was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
4562,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
4563,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
4564,the bathroom was dirty and the room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing,2
4565,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
4566,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
4567,room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was a live-in hotel,2
4568,my wife and i were in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
4569,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and in the hallways,2
4570,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort,2
4571,they were in the middle of the night,2
4572,the bathroom had some hair on the floor when we got there,2
4573,it's a bit run down and drab,2
4574,the next room didn't have a plunger for baths,2
4575,because the stay was free i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
4576,i just hate that i had to call for a remote for the tv,2
4577,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
4578,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a different room but the air still didn't seem cool enough,2
4579,i classify this as you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
4580,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was terrible,2
4581,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
4582,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
4583,imagine it was 23 30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
4584,weird part 1 was the second room did not have air conditioning so the room got hot at night,2
4585,the shower floor needed new tile and the toilet had urine and other unidentifiable things around it was ok for a one night stay,2
4586,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
4587,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2
4588,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
4589,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room did have a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have the problem,2
4590,we were put in the ac didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
4591,the hotel needs to be updated through out hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
4592,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
4593,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
4594,the only problem i had was that there was only one person on at one time,2
4595,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the bathroom is good provide very simple breakfast,2
4596,a c blew cold air but the room was overpriced for the quality of the t,2
4597,please do not stay at this hotel in the summer,2
4598,the food at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room,2
4599,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed,2
4600,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
4601,i did not feel that the room was extremely over dated,2
4602,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for a place to crash,2
4603,that made this disappointing stay a bit easier to swallow but i will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future,2
4604,later i asked the front desk and they put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site,2
4605,their toiletries were actually very nice gilchrist and soames but there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
4606,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep,2
4607,after a long summer day in phx heat i was not pleased with the cleaniness of the room,2
4608,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
4609,com said free breakfast and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
4610,we survived the night but i won't stay in this place again,2
4611,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
4612,overall the room was fine and the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
4613,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12 00 noon,2
4614,only good thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
4615,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
4616,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
4617,took all night to warm up even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
4618,i would never stay at this hotel if you are a hotel snob stay as far away from this hotel,2
4619,our toilet stopped working in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
4620,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the room it was a disaster,2
4621,there breakfast was very disappointing had to take a smoking room and it wasn't family friendly,2
4622,room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
4623,00 for my room for one night and this was through,2
4624,if your in real need of a place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
4625,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
4626,but if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate lesser hotel,2
4627,my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
4628,then in the morning i purchased a coffee and was drinking it in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
4629,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
4630,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
4631,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
4632,it was not the worst place we could have stayed at the valencia several times but now have had two disappointing visits,2
4633,it is right up to the freeway but the road in front was loud,2
4634,if all you need is a place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
4635,the hotel itself is run down and drab,2
4636,we felt safe in our room even though there was a line of 5 people deep waiting to check in,2
4637,only one of two hotels in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
4638,i paid for a rollout and when i returned to the front desk but not other beverages,2
4639,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in the room you had to go around to get inside,2
4640,checkout both times the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not well maintained,2
4641,door handle broke inside the room and the water was cold in the shower,2
4642,rooms are real small and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
4643,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
4644,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
4645,the gentleman who was at the front desk is enclosed at night for the most part,2
4646,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
4647,i do not want to stay in a room where the carpet was wet,2
4648,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
4649,there seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chairs watching tv,2
4650,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
4651,ours was a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
4652,needless to say we will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4653,told receptionist about it and they didn't clean it from the last person,2
4654,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a map in the room,2
4655,next time i will stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
4656,it was awful and our room smelled so bad we asked for another room,2
4657,will not stay at this hotel in the summer,2
4658,the room had been cleaned and the corners looked like they had been there for months splattered on the curtains,2
4659,we asked for a different room because bathroom was not clean on arrival,2
4660,the hotel is in renovation but in the middle of july is kind of important,2
4661,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
4662,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
4663,the location was good as we were able to walk to all of the local attractions with ease,2
4664,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far the worst i have had,2
4665,the literature in the room says if we don't have a bed for you,2
4666,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
4667,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the 118,2
4668,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of towels,2
4669,we ended up leaving this place a night early and going to another hotel because of the shape of this one,2
4670,toilet seat was soiled and i had to stay in one with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
4671,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
4672,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door,2
4673,it's about 20 min walk to the center the hotel is in need of a major power wash,2
4674,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is nice and clean and near the convention center,2
4675,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
4676,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
4677,the first room the window did not close and we were on the first floor in hotels that have outside facing doors,2
4678,it's about 40 minute walk to the disney toy story parking lot,2
4679,room was plenty clean but did have a bit of a hodge-podge of decor,2
4680,when i checked in the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
4681,the phone in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
4682,the smell was very musty and there was mold on the ceiling in the pool room,2
4683,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
4684,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
4685,there was no iron in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair,2
4686,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
4687,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
4688,the safe was out of order the old school t,2
4689,also on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
4690,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
4691,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot,2
4692,it should state the hotel is not upto us standards,2
4693,this hotel is not worth the money we spent we were a little disappointed,2
4694,the receptionist said they didn't have ear plugs,2
4695,we frequently stay in roanoke for the night and noticed that the bedding was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
4696,i booked a room at this hotel was short of expectations,2
4697,the good thing was the front desk staff was very personable though,2
4698,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
4699,there was a broken lamp in our room and we had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet,2
4700,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
4701,for the price the room could have been a bit cleaner,2
4702,limited supply of hot water in the shower the same could not be said for the room sink,2
4703,there was no air conditioning in any of the rooms and when i asked if there was a short in the electrical system,2
4704,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the bungalows was going to be staying for 5 weeks,2
4705,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not turn off complained and was told it would be ready in the morning,2
4706,overall the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
4707,a bit pricey for what you get but there aren't many hotels in this area to go here again,2
4708,we asked for a room upgrade and were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
4709,the room had a balcony which it did but we were not informed about the treacherous 20 min drive from gatlinburg,2
4710,they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
4711,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
4712,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with the hot water in my third floor room,2
4713,the room was not very clean and the room did have a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
4714,i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star,2
4715,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
4716,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not clean,2
4717,it should state the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
4718,one of those days that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there,2
4719,the innisbrook resort didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
4720,with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to get down the hallway to our room,2
4721,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
4722,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
4723,i didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
4724,i returned to the room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
4725,we were not happy to see roaches in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
4726,weird part 1 was the second room did not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
4727,after working out and returning to our room we were met with an oh,2
4728,during the stay the room was very poor and limited choices,2
4729,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
4730,everything was worn but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and tub were less than acceptable,2
4731,i chose this hotel because it was close to my job site,2
4732,utensils were available but you have to ask it would have been way better than that crap,2
4733,unexpected layover required a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel in the different occasions,2
4734,there was a drunk man sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
4735,i booked a smoking room but when i checked in manager informed me all the rooms were non smoking,2
4736,when i contacted the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even have bagels,2
4737,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
4738,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
4739,and that the hot tub was not working,2
4740,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
4741,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
4742,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
4743,the room was overall clean and the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable,2
4744,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
4745,no amenities were in the room with you,2
4746,so needless to say we were not happy with our stay,2
4747,the carpet looked like it hasn't been updated in quite a while,2
4748,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
4749,it is right up to the freeway but the road in front was loud,2
4750,they charge for parking which i didn't think was possible,2
4751,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
4752,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
4753,sheer curtains only on the windows so no privacy on the first floor in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
4754,the staff and the breakfast was not on site,2
4755,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to dunken donuts,2
4756,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
4757,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
4758,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
4759,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
4760,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
4761,first of all the lobby was nice and the staff were friendly,2
4762,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
4763,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
4764,we really never even felt part of the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
4765,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
4766,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
4767,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
4768,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room with two double beds and a sleep sofa,2
4769,the tub and bathroom were very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
4770,i called the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
4771,the pool and hot tub were not in operation and there was no breakfast left and it was not good,2
4772,room smelled of smoke even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
4773,we tried to go to the hampton inn,2
4774,after returning to our room at 9 am there was no hot water for hot cocoa or hot cereal,2
4775,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
4776,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
4777,the only thing i liked about it was the bed was comfortable and the room was kind of gross,2
4778,the centennial inn bb is a large grand old house right in the middle of a spooky dirt road in the middle of the carpet,2
4779,two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
4780,i know santa barbara is expensive but for the price you pay for this hotel,2
4781,the hotel made minority's feel uncomfortable when we walked into the first room that we were put in a small 4 plex,2
4782,our room smelled so bad that i had to open the windows when i first got in,2
4783,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
4784,but the breakfast spread was good but the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
4785,i found that our room had a broken,2
4786,i had to request to leave the hotel because it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
4787,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
4788,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
4789,when we arrived to check in i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
4790,we have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
4791,the first time i had made reservations and also confirmed the day before but there was none in the room,2
4792,my wife and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
4793,the water wasn't working for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
4794,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
4795,this hotel is much in need of a major power wash,2
4796,the poorest holiday inn express we have stayed in hotel before around 3 years ago,2
4797,was forced to stay because it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
4798,the room though has seen better days although is in a very bad area of town,2
4799,when that happens the hotel will certainly be a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was clean,2
4800,but if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
4801,i found that our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
4802,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good response,2
4803,a c was not turned on and warm,2
4804,i will use this hotel again if i don't have a problem with roaches,2
4805,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
4806,pubes in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there we were put in a small 4 plex,2
4807,you just have to lure an employee to the front desk and they assured us that we would get one momentarily,2
4808,the check in was quick so we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
4809,the bed was covered in hair as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the desk said she can not accept,2
4810,my beef is with the front desk been rude well this time it was a visit from hell,2
4811,it was not at all clean the air conditioner did not make the bedroom cold,2
4812,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
4813,i got a good night's sleep as the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean,2
4814,i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
4815,fair but they woke us up at 5 27 and we did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
4816,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
4817,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
4818,there was mold on the ceiling in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there the room had a not pleasant smell,2
4819,purchased a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
4820,outdated hotel i will never stay here again,2
4821,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk that i could not go to my room yet,2
4822,we inquired how long it would be and they told us we had to leave the door open just to,2
4823,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
4824,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to stuff,2
4825,the toilet looked like it hadn't been updated since 1985,2
4826,since my room was next to the door and the room was not very nice and the breakfast was good,2
4827,the check in was quick so we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
4828,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
4829,was not impressed with the condition of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
4830,we have stayed at this hotel in the future,2
4831,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
4832,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
4833,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all to rave about,2
4834,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
4835,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
4836,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
4837,the continental breakfast was not worth the 118,2
4838,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
4839,after several minutes i went to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
4840,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
4841,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
4842,the room was decent for the price but bring ear plugs,2
4843,could hear thepeople in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
4844,the real problem however was the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
4845,but i won't be staying at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone in the future,2
4846,the manager did deduct 25 but we will never stay at this hotel if you are looking expecting a quiet night,2
4847,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to have the room key coded for our second day's visit,2
4848,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
4849,our last trip to this hotel was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
4850,also the room fan wouldn't work and the temperature in the room was not cleaned after the last guests,2
4851,no water pressure faucet falling off mattress hard as a rock pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
4852,i knew when i booked this hotel because it was close to my job site,2
4853,staff was nice and the breakfast was good as well with lots of cereals waffles etc,2
4854,the hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
4855,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
4856,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
4857,the house keep called in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
4858,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
4859,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
4860,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
4861,hair dryer cord broken it worked but seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
4862,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't fit the large closet,2
4863,the cockroaches in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
4864,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
4865,was forced to stay because it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
4866,room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
4867,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and room was clean though,2
4868,00 for my room for one night and booked it last minute mainly because there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,2
4869,plumbing drains in room did not work room layout was not the same as advertised and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
4870,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
4871,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
4872,was not impressed with the condition of the room for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
4873,when i went back to the front desk,2
4874,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we were told to try here,2
4875,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
4876,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
4877,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
4878,the staff was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
4879,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go back to the desk to get them,2
4880,the ugly i stayed at this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
4881,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
4882,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
4883,i definitely will not be staying here again,2
4884,after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night as it was the cheapest way to be close to the miami airport,2
4885,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not clean enough dirts around door windows the sink stuck,2
4886,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
4887,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
4888,the staff was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
4889,the hotel is centrally located and a good price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
4890,i guess if you don't have to spend a lot and not going to be a pleasant stay,2
4891,i booked a room for king size bed but was given a room that smelled like smoke,2
4892,the picture on the website where i found this hotel was not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
4893,also the room fan wouldn't work and the next room the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
4894,cheap for just fishing but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
4895,i needed a room for the night and that they were moving us to the room next door through the walls,2
4896,beds were comfortable and the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
4897,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be back,2
4898,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
4899,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
4900,bird droppings all over back entry that was closest to our room smelled of smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
4901,room 308 314 are the best in the world but it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
4902,first of all i booked this room for the night,2
4903,they put us in another room which didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
4904,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
4905,we couldn't get into the room until 6 00 p,2
4906,office was closed when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
4907,there was a broken lamp in our room and or brought to us when we called the front desk the gentleman said oh,2
4908,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
4909,i prefer to stay in marriotts however this one is very outdated and the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
4910,from the outside this appears to be more than just a bad review,2
4911,mold in the shower stains on the carpet and prepare for your socks to look like you were walking over huge bumps in it,2
4912,the staff was nice and the staff were super friendly,2
4913,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the long drive to the sd black hills,2
4914,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
4915,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
4916,i don't expect miracles for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
4917,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
4918,when you close the door to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
4919,the room was clean and staff was nice and the staff was friendly but the mitel room and are were the worst,2
4920,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
4921,the people are nice but the room is so noisy,2
4922,the second room didn't have a room for someone with walking handicap because i had to attend a funeral at arlington cemetery,2
4923,when i went in to complain i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
4924,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even though our non smoking room was indeed non smoking and there was no place to put our things,2
4925,not real impressed by this place we won't be staying at this hotel again,2
4926,we asked for an immediate move to another room and the mattress there was a little better,2
4927,very little space with a family of four into a room with a shared bathroom,2
4928,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
4929,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
4930,even worse when i went to use it,2
4931,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room from what i understood,2
4932,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
4933,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
4934,i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable and the room was still to hot,2
4935,it was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
4936,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
4937,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
4938,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to request a room change because the odor was so bad,2
4939,the street in the front of the door and the room was freezing,2
4940,the deck by the pool felt like it was in the nicest area of town,2
4941,no air conditioning in any of the rooms and when i asked if there was a complimentary breakfast and was told yes,2
4942,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
4943,the manager did deduct 25 but we will never stay again worth extra money to stay across road at comfort inn,2
4944,it actually made it very difficult for me to navigate my way to the casino lobby and eventually found someone working,2
4945,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
4946,they did move us to a different room or different hotel period,2
4947,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
4948,the hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
4949,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
4950,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go off on her,2
4951,i was in the room and phone didn't work and the owner refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
4952,place was more like a bowl though i was able to get a refund from hotels,2
4953,when i went back to the lobby to ask for it to be cleaned the second day which didn't happen,2
4954,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and we had to be evacuated,2
4955,a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a night,2
4956,hotel itself was okay but the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
4957,we read the good reviews and decided to try staying here,2
4958,almost gagged when we open the door to our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
4959,we have had good experiences at other country inns and suites but this was not at all what i expected,2
4960,staying in winston-salem was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
4961,good someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk was nice enough to let us check in early,2
4962,but at least the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that,2
4963,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
4964,we stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
4965,hotel was not very clean the bathroom had mold in the shower stains on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom area,2
4966,people were literally moving in on the day we arrived the hot tub was out of order the old school t,2
4967,although clean i will not stay there again especially for 100,2
4968,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4969,the location of the room i was given had no desk,2
4970,in general the only good thing about this was hotel,2
4971,this place is in need of an overhaul,2
4972,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was a joke,2
4973,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
4974,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
4975,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
4976,the hot tub was not in order and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
4977,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk to get them there,2
4978,weird part 1 was the second room did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
4979,staff not really friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
4980,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
4981,overall i will not be back to stay at this hotel again mostly because of the lack of customer service by the staff,2
4982,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
4983,they moved us to a corner room on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
4984,room smelled of old smoke even though a non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2
4985,later found out the front desk staff manager were pleasant,2
4986,it started with the phone in the room was very basic,2
4987,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
4988,it looked like it had not been changed,2
4989,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
4990,i asked the front desk for guests,2
4991,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
4992,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
4993,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful,2
4994,the phone in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
4995,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
4996,we will not be back to stay at this holiday inn,2
4997,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
4998,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
4999,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
5000,i asked for a receipt and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
5001,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the vanity that was just filthy grungy disgusting,2
5002,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
5003,however air conditioner ran intermittently so room got too warm so i had to set it and it was fine,2
5004,the air in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be a motel where people live there not just stay overnight,2
5005,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
5006,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
5007,the bath room was clean and i felt like i was on an undercover program,2
5008,although i had read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
5009,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
5010,on the first night when i returned to the front desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
5011,first day we got there the room had a bad odor,2
5012,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
5013,we were on our way to the hotel we thought it was only for one night so we booked it,2
5014,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
5015,when i got to my room i couldn't believe it,2
5016,everyone was nice and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
5017,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
5018,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
5019,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
5020,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
5021,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
5022,my second time staying there the location is great and the concierge did recommend us a good restaurant,2
5023,it also didn't seem like it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
5024,i would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
5025,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with the hot water in the shower to heat up,2
5026,i stayed at this hotel for business i asked the guy at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
5027,we checked into the hotel late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
5028,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk agent that explained the stench,2
5029,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
5030,the hotel didn't work above the main floor the elevators were a joke 2 working elevators for 80 people in line,2
5031,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
5032,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got there we were put in it smelled horrible and like mildew,2
5033,when we arrived back to the hotel around 3 45 and was offered a smoking room and the sign on the door as non smoking,2
5034,the room was clean and staff was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
5035,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
5036,i have traveled all over the bathroom floor,2
5037,the bathroom could have been really nice but the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
5038,the remote did not work in my room,2
5039,front desk reception was friendly and courteous but the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
5040,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
5041,we were happy with our choice as the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
5042,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
5043,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
5044,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it would be fixed,2
5045,the lady cooking was also the front desk person kept saying they were working on it,2
5046,that room was not very clean and breakfast was not very good,2
5047,the breakfast food was below par and i would recommend to anyone or stay at again,2
5048,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
5049,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
5050,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
5051,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
5052,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
5053,then we went to our room which was disappointing,2
5054,the fan in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting a lot,2
5055,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of rehabilitation,2
5056,i had a decent check in with a young guy and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
5057,we have stayed here twice now and both times there was a hand written no vacancy sign taped to the window,2
5058,they did put me in a room that was not facing the ocean which was fine by us,2
5059,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
5060,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
5061,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work at all and in the living room only,2
5062,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not that large compare to the picture,2
5063,tv wasn't working and we had a room on the 1st floor,2
5064,about the only nice thing i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
5065,the rooms where dated it smelled one tv did not work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
5066,finally got a room in the same building,2
5067,beds were comfortable and room was clean and nicely furnished,2
5068,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
5069,all around its a decent room but definitely not for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
5070,the reason we chose this hotel thinking the location was convenient for my trip,2
5071,it was right off the interstate but that is the only positive thing,2
5072,com to get assistance they gave me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street,2
5073,however one of the rooms i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
5074,the neighborhood didn't feel safe at all,2
5075,during the second night i woke up with a sore back each morning,2
5076,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
5077,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
5078,also the phone in my room did not have the type of room that we booked available,2
5079,went to the front desk to inform me that there was a old musky scent that encompassed the entire hotel,2
5080,our room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
5081,the hotel is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel,2
5082,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
5083,if all you need is a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
5084,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
5085,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
5086,the was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room was a huge disappointment,2
5087,even though it is an older hotel but if you are just looking for a place to crash,2
5088,thought it was a hostel but it is not a boutique hotel as the sign says,2
5089,told receptionist about it and they did nothing to fix the issues,2
5090,the hotel was very empty and our room was not ready so we had to,2
5091,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to wait for 2 hours for housekeeping,2
5092,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a new one,2
5093,the floor had not been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
5094,i don't expect the best in the world but it wasn't the greatest,2
5095,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
5096,this hotel is much in need of a good update in the general areas,2
5097,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
5098,it might be ok for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
5099,after using another facility for a couple of minutes someone shouted out that they would be there in lost and found,2
5100,bed was comfortable but i would only stay the hotel if it was the last room available,2
5101,or maybe my nostrils were used to it either way if we had to pay 10 to park in the garage the first time,2
5102,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
5103,it's a place to stay for weeks on end,2
5104,then they put us in a room on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the grand canal,2
5105,the general condition of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
5106,best western needs to update this hotel desperatelyand would never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel,2
5107,the hotel is ridiculously overpriced and is no better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
5108,the front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
5109,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk were friendly and helpful,2
5110,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
5111,i was excited to stay at this hotel if you are looking for three beds in a room there are no such rooms,2
5112,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to open the windows when i first got in,2
5113,they gave us a new room at midnight,2
5114,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk at midnight to complain,2
5115,the box spring was noise getting in and out of the bed smelt the bed and found that it was wet with urine,2
5116,the good thing was the rooms were clean enough but just not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
5117,com is the only reason we booked a hotel for a get away,2
5118,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
5119,we paid more for two queen beds in one room,2
5120,when i asked about it i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
5121,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day,2
5122,hotel is under construction so it will be nice upon completion but we were not able to resolve it during our stay,2
5123,when that happens the hotel will certainly be a great place to stay for a last minute business trip,2
5124,pools were nice and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
5125,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for a wedding,2
5126,i received no sleep at all and we were there for 2 nights and the bill ended up being over 205,2
5127,the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
5128,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
5129,this was my second stay at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
5130,maintenance came to room told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
5131,questioned front desk and was told i would have to pay 4,2
5132,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
5133,hotel is in need of a deep clean,2
5134,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
5135,we stayed here for one night on a road trip,2
5136,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
5137,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
5138,this particular candlewood i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
5139,there was no air conditioning in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
5140,the tv didn't work and when i asked about a fan the person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
5141,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one ice machine in whole complex and always empty,2
5142,when we again asked for a rollaway they said they didn't find it and there was nothing,2
5143,worse part there were ants in the room which was fine,2
5144,in my room there was a very large dead roach in the middle of the night and it was dealt with promptly,2
5145,it just did not feel very can and up to date but the rooms are run down,2
5146,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend anyone to stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it at all,2
5147,i've stayed in were much better and didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
5148,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
5149,in fact while i was checking in one of the beds in our room was attacked by bed bugs,2
5150,the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there,2
5151,had to switch rooms front desk was very sweet but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
5152,the property itself is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
5153,we had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
5154,when i went back to the front desk,2
5155,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a 4 inch step making entry with a power wheelchair difficutl,2
5156,will not be returning to this hotel was so disappointing,2
5157,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
5158,the room was overpriced for the quality of the beds the pillow was the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
5159,last time i booked a room at this hotel was short of expectations,2
5160,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
5161,i called in at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
5162,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in the room you had to go sit in reception,2
5163,that's one reason why i stayed in this hotel and the first time i have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned,2
5164,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom like the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was horrible,2
5165,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
5166,the door to our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
5167,the internet was spotty and the peeling wallpaper and poorly patched holes in the walls towel rack and tv bracket ripped out of the walls,2
5168,from the outside this appears to be a much better neighborhood,2
5169,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
5170,i stayed a night coz i did not want to endure long drives between sf and forestville,2
5171,i can not fault the friendliness of the staff at this hotel do not have a clue,2
5172,then next day the staff didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
5173,the second room smelled so bad that i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
5174,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
5175,other than this it was great but i don't think they even replace the sheets,2
5176,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is not well lit,2
5177,the door to the bathroom you automatically start sweating had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise,2
5178,the motel is tidy and the room was clean so okay going better,2
5179,the motel adjusted my rate due to the lack of rain and was not a health hazard,2
5180,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
5181,when we asked for a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
5182,com and got it straightened out but it was a best western so my expectations shouldn't be high,2
5183,almost turned around when we got to our room the pillows had no pillow cases,2
5184,the hook fell off the back of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
5185,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
5186,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here,2
5187,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
5188,staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
5189,my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
5190,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
5191,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia he could not discount or comp me,2
5192,the television is one of the room amenities,2
5193,the fitness room was very small the room was a bit musty smelling,2
5194,when i went in to complain i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
5195,prior to staying at this hotel again unless it had,2
5196,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
5197,last morning there there was a roach in the room and the additional charges,2
5198,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the room was clean,2
5199,somewhat outdated and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
5200,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
5201,first off i found four hairs on the bedsheets when i pulled back the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
5202,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was incredible,2
5203,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
5204,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
5205,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go off on her,2
5206,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
5207,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
5208,we had a room on the first floor,2
5209,we were there to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
5210,mold on the shower curtain and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
5211,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
5212,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to have the room key coded for our second day's visit,2
5213,no hot water in our room and in the hallways,2
5214,i booked through expedia and my room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged when we arrived,2
5215,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
5216,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
5217,com said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the website after i said i had no access to the website,2
5218,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the staff and all i got was i'm sorry,2
5219,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room which had obviously been a smoking room recently,2
5220,mold in the showers and very uncomfortable beds made for a not so pleasant stay at quality suites intercontinental west,2
5221,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
5222,i know it's a lot of work to bring it up to par,2
5223,com said free breakfast and there was no wholewheat bagels so on a scale of 1-10 i would only rate them a 5,2
5224,we were told we had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
5225,no amenities were in the room with you,2
5226,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the inn used the inn parking lot for parking,2
5227,this may have been due to the color of the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
5228,came back to the room for the price i was satisfied however,2
5229,the hotel itself is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
5230,when we got there when i booked 2 queen beds and get there and there was nothing we could do about it,2
5231,the were so bad it was hard to get what we needed,2
5232,the lady at reception simply handed me a map of all of cape cod i wanted the immediate area,2
5233,however in my reservation i was put into one of the rooms had no soap toilet paper shampoo trash can and sheets etc,2
5234,the room was clean but needs to be updated through out hotel is old and in a very industrial area,2
5235,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
5236,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
5237,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
5238,my wife and i will never stay in another sleep inn,2
5239,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
5240,general appearance of the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad,2
5241,when i told them there was a roach in the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
5242,the mattress was hard as a rock pillows gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
5243,guess they were not happy with the lack of modern conveniences we take for granted today,2
5244,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
5245,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to everything,2
5246,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful,2
5247,we would not stay at this location again,2
5248,they were busy when we got there we were put in the ac didn't get very cold,2
5249,it turns out it was the worst experience,2
5250,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
5251,upon checking the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not clean and the floor were uneven and needed repairs,2
5252,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
5253,if i didn't have any available,2
5254,i chose this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
5255,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
5256,i read reviews of this hotel while looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending,2
5257,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
5258,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no one at the front desk,2
5259,thought it was a hostel but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
5260,i had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
5261,we stayed two nights and the room was kind of gross,2
5262,the carpet and chair in the room was not working no channel,2
5263,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
5264,staff was pleasant at check-in about the policy,2
5265,the staff was courteous and room was clean and some renovations were done lately,2
5266,we stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of the old curved screen types with an adapter on it,2
5267,it had a dingy smell and was very old and the mattress and box spring were old and broken,2
5268,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
5269,i didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
5270,staff was nice and the breakfast was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
5271,and on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2

5276,when we arrived back to the hotel around 3 45 and was offered a smoking room and it wasn't busy when i was there,2
5277,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
5278,the motel is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
5279,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
5280,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the macon bi-pass,2

5291,i've stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
5292,after that on our way to the hotel we thought it was a kingsize but actually a twin with window cushion,2
5293,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
5294,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2

5301,there were no supplies and i had to leave the door open just to,2
5302,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
5303,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2

5313,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
5314,the room was very small the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
5315,felt like i was in a room with a jet tub and we had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet,2
5316,if you are unlucky enough to have one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
5317,no amenities were in the room with you,2
5318,the best thing about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
5319,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is quite run down and in need of repairs,2
5320,after dragging all the kids back to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and room was clean though,2
5321,the place just needs a little face lift,2
5322,the check in staff was very friendly a big plus,2
5323,the door to the bathroom didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
5324,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2

5327,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
5328,we went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable and the correct comforter weight is in use,2
5329,there were gigantic burns on all the sheets i understand it is a smoking room so we don't know how this hotel averaged 3,2

5344,check in was quick but when we went to the market to buy our own,2
5345,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but bathroom is in great need of renewal,2
5346,my family and i were in town for a conference and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
5347,kind of like walmart if you don't have a problem with roaches,2
5348,the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
5349,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
5350,only took 2 hours to get the room i booked online,2
5351,second room they moved us to a different room,2
5352,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
5353,but once inside the room it was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door didn't lock appropriately,2
5354,stayed here several times in the middle of the floor,2
5355,None,2
5356,the water wasn't working for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
5357,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
5358,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
5359,this continued through the night so needless to say we won't be back,2

5369,the first room the window did not close and we were on the opposite side of the hotel then i had requested,2
5370,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
5371,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
5372,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2

5376,other people told me that they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
5377,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it was located in a basement,2
5378,i would say this hotel was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
5379,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
5380,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
5381,i called the front desk and request it,2
5382,also the next morning i noticed a used wash cloth hanging on the shower from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
5383,the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the hotel and location were good,2
5384,by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
5385,also the phone in my room did not have a hair dryer,2
5386,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
5387,this may have been due to the color of the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
5388,the desk clerk was very friendly and polite but the room had dirty comforters and had to be replaced,2
5389,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was dirty,2

5393,we were there to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
5394,drug central i would never stay there again,2
5395,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
5396,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
5397,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
5398,then around 6 am that whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be a fire hazard,2
5399,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
5400,the carpet in the room was very basic,2
5401,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
5402,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
5403,outdated hotel and long lines to check in and other needs,2
5404,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on it would have started a fire,2
5405,didn't know we had to pay 10 to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
5406,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel if you are a senior,2
5407,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
5408,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
5409,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2

5411,the location was good for us but i won't be going back,2
5412,the person who answered the phone told me our room would be renovated by the time we reached it was late afternoon,2
5413,the gentleman who was at the front desk was very helpful and kind,2
5414,room 308 314 are the best in the world but it wasn't necessary,2
5415,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
5416,the front facade looks great but the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
5417,the rooms had old decor and the bed was comfortable and nice soaps,2
5418,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had been booked to someone else as well,2
5419,the hotel was very empty and our room wasn't ready for us yet,2
5420,it works for your needs but for the price and if you are staying for a few hours,2
5421,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
5422,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
5423,the continental breakfast was the worst i have stayed at this hotel for several months due to it's proximity to work,2

5425,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and breakfast was not much at all,2
5426,there is no one at the front desk,2
5427,front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in bad condition and ridiculously over-priced,2
5428,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
5429,after that on our way to dinner and they said they forgot to fix it,2
5430,sorry but if you want to sleep,2
5431,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
5432,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
5433,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
5434,while the bedding and towels were clean and nice but the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and the bed was uncomfortable,2
5435,i needed a room for one night you think it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
5436,staff not very friendly room was too hot and hotel staff did not care,2
5437,first impression of the room when we arrived and upon departure,2
5438,non smoking room and the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
5439,you could hear everyone around you as well as the tray it sat on,2
5440,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i will never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel,2
5441,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
5442,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
5443,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
5444,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
5445,it has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners the ac didn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
5446,the beds were comfortable but the room we had was small and cramped and prices where out of line regardless of their location,2
5447,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
5448,took all night to warm up even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
5449,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel because it was in boone iowa and we had a big centipede in our room,2
5450,we were very disappointed in this room for the price i was severely dissapointed,2
5451,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
5452,we had to call for a remote for the tv in the fitness center,2
5453,i made our reservations for 3 rooms but was not told the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
5454,i think the reason the lighting is so dim is so you don't have to drag my with me,2
5455,i requested a king size bed and was told we had a room with 2 queen beds,2
5456,when i went in to complain i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
5457,well for this little town being so close to steamboat springs you would think the hotel would have given us for the room,2
5458,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
5459,this hotel is old and in need of significant upgrades,2
5460,we had an issue with noisy neighbors in the middle of july is kind of important,2
5461,i have stayed in the area was about 2 years ago and we'd stayed at this hotel 3 times,2
5462,the light between the bed was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
5463,it is in desperate need of an update,2
5464,there was no sunlight to be found and the access to the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
5465,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
5466,i thought i was in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
5467,not sure what the other rooms were like but i had a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room,2
5468,the room was okay but the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
5469,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
5470,very little space with a family of four into a room with a private bath,2
5471,i do have an appreciation for security however at the cost of the the normal hotels we stay at were double the normal cost,2
5472,the breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
5473,if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you need a quick and short stay for one night and seemed ok until i,2
5474,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
5475,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
5476,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
5477,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
5478,i understand that it is a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
5479,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for a receipt and she refused to give me one,2
5480,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
5481,but the room were clean and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
5482,our room was ok however my brother had to immediately return to the desk and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
5483,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
5484,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was very worn and uncomfortable,2
5485,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a last minute trip,2
5486,the neighborhood didn't feel safe at all,2
5487,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get down the hallway to our room,2
5488,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
5489,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm,2
5490,our view out the window was of the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
5491,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
5492,price was the best thing about the hotel,2
5493,the room smelled of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest and bathroom and living area were dusty,2
5494,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were smelly and the latch on my door was broke,2
5495,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very small and not clean,2
5496,we booked it because it wasn't a big deal,2
5497,we were on the first floor in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
5498,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
5499,there was food in the floor when i got to my room and that they were moving us to the room next door below,2
5500,i expected something better for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
5501,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
5502,no reason to hang around allowed one to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
5503,i expected something better for the price we paid it was just fine,2
5504,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
5505,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
5506,hotel was fully booked so we were stick with the room when we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
5507,plastic egg patties we were in the air was broken,2
5508,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
5509,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
5510,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
5511,but was in a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
5512,the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning didn't work well nor the wi-fi would not connect,2
5513,we arrived late and the front desk and she was,2
5514,the place just needs a little face lift,2
5515,i had to ask for it to be cleaned the second day which didn't happen,2
5516,the shower also ran out of hot water by the time i returned,2
5517,we arrived at the address we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
5518,com i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
5519,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
5520,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to the sawgrass mills mall,2
5521,while the bedding and towels were clean and nice but the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and also had stains,2
5522,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
5523,second when requesting a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
5524,to start off with good the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
5525,just our luck the late guests made over a dozen trips in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
5526,other then the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
5527,i can take some wear if the place is clean but not great on breakfast and hard to understand staff,2
5528,my daughter slept in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
5529,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
5530,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
5531,it was hard as a rock pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
5532,i don't expect the best in the world but it wasn't enough for everyone,2
5533,i booked a room with two queen beds,2
5534,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and the breakfast was very odd,2
5535,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
5536,called the front desk and told them i would have to tell you that i would rather sleep in my car before stay here again,2
5537,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and the toilet ran,2
5538,room was very old and very run down,2
5539,during my time there i was either taking the exam or in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
5540,our first clue of how this stay was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
5541,i needed a room for one night and seemed ok until i,2
5542,the wifi did not work in our room,2
5543,we arrived late and was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
5544,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
5545,the staff was nice and helpful but the king bed was terrible,2
5546,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
5547,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
5548,when we arrived there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
5549,then we went to our room which was disappointing,2
5550,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
5551,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
5552,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
5553,no water pressure faucet falling off mattress hard as a rock pillows were very small and uncomfortable,2
5554,get a room with a shared bathroom,2
5555,occupants in the room a couple of months ago it was a country inn and suites signage etc,2
5556,if your in real need of a place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
5557,this is the very first we went to the front desk to get them there,2
5558,first they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
5559,over all you get what you pay for a place to sleep this one will do,2
5560,other than that the rooms are old and creepy looking,2
5561,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
5562,elevator didn't work and we had to take turns sleeping in the car with the pooch,2
5563,we were not apprised of this by management at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
5564,replaced tv when we went to the front desk and time-share sales from the minute one,2
5565,there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
5566,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
5567,bad smell in the room and i will not recommend to a friend,2
5568,we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
5569,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was not very clean,2
5570,it was impossible for her to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
5571,she asked if i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
5572,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room,2
5573,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
5574,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
5575,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
5576,the second room was a bit musty smelling,2
5577,it was impossible for her to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
5578,called the front desk we had to wait for 2 hours for housekeeping,2
5579,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
5580,the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly,2
5581,i stayed a night coz i did not want to endure long drives between sf and forestville,2
5582,we ordered towels early in the morning which was annoying,2
5583,maintenance came to room told us that we had to pay 48 extra,2
5584,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
5585,if all you need is a place to stay for the weekend of my boyfriends graduation which was memorial day weekend,2
5586,we had a room on the top floor no elevator,2
5587,well to start off there were dead bugs that looked like they had been vomited in several times over the last few years,2
5588,our room was like a marriott room which is fine but one always seemed to not know what they were doing,2
5589,its very old and out of date and the bed not very comfortable,2
5590,but the room was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room was a problem,2
5591,good possibility won't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
5592,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
5593,we asked for a room that was right next to the motel,2
5594,they have a laminated paper at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
5595,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
5596,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
5597,thought i booked at country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
5598,the air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed for repair,2
5599,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
5600,pool was closed and room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
5601,there was one towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
5602,they were busy when we got there there was no one at the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot also,2
5603,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
5604,overall this hotel is good for a one night stay but we won't be staying there again,2
5605,i told the staff they said they don't have a bed for you,2
5606,she was not very nice and the breakfast was great,2
5607,i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not stay there again especially for 100,2
5608,we got in late around 10 30p and by the time we were told that we could move for a thousand for 4 nights,2
5609,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
5610,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
5611,staff not really friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
5612,it looked like it hasn't been updated in decades,2
5613,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
5614,the housekeepers knocked on the door at 8 am which wasn't a big deal but it had stains on it as well,2
5615,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
5616,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
5617,the shower head was falling out of the ceiling in the shower and the grab bar came off in my hand,2
5618,when i called down for assistance i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
5619,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
5620,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
5621,room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
5622,breakfast area way too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
5623,there was no hot water in our room and we had to ask for extra bed sheets to cover the mattress,2
5624,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
5625,the website stated that the room had a faint smoke smell and i requested a non smoking room and hall smelled like smoke,2
5626,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
5627,the hot tub was broken the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but they never fixed it,2
5628,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
5629,the room was clean and staff was nice but we went from a room with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room,2
5630,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
5631,there was hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
5632,our room looked like it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
5633,my daughter slept in one of the beds also had some sort of dirt or blood on them in the bathroom,2
5634,however the room didn't feel clean and the place was a dump and won't stay again,2
5635,the hotel was clean but very run down,2
5636,i was disappointed that they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in a room on the first floor available,2
5637,price was very good and the breakfast was poor,2
5638,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the lake with lakeview rooms but the service is horrible,2
5639,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was by far the worst,2
5640,None,2
5641,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
5642,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
5643,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
5644,the gal at the front desk were friendly,2
5645,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the original card i would have,2
5646,we needed a place close to yosemite however i would not book this hotel again in the future,2
5647,family coming for vacation i would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
5648,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
5649,so they put us in a room on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the grand canal,2
5650,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
5651,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
5652,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
5653,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
5654,older hotel but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and tub were less than acceptable,2
5655,there was notmany toliets in the room and they said they forgot to fix it,2
5656,room got up to 83 before i went to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
5657,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days but the excitement ended there,2
5658,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
5659,the good thing was the water was hot and the water pressure was very low so that was also annoying,2
5660,the room was not very nice at all,2
5661,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
5662,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying there,2
5663,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
5664,if all you need is a place to stay where we felt safe,2
5665,the room was small and cramped and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
5666,if you just need a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here for sure,2
5667,first of all i booked this room for the night,2
5668,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
5669,bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
5670,staff was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
5671,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
5672,i wouldn't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
5673,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
5674,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come,2
5675,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
5676,with honest work this can be a great place to go and enjoy the warm weather in or around the pool,2
5677,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
5678,this place is in need of a remodel,2
5679,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to get a plastic fork so i could eat my dinner,2
5680,sorry but we will not be coming back,2
5681,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
5682,the room was pretty nice but the bathroom definitely needs to be updated just like the rest of the floor,2
5683,it had a dingy smell and was very old and moldy plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool,2
5684,picked this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is close to the highway with a lot of highway noise,2
5685,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western plus kelly inn in st cloud mn on 01 30 16,2
5686,we were very disappointed as the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
5687,however the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
5688,stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
5689,our non-smoking room and the sign on the door that tells ppl it automatically locks but it does nt,2
5690,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
5691,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
5692,we had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
5693,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but i have stayed in this hotel while in lee's summit,2
5694,there were ants in the room which was fine,2
5695,as i walked into the hotel the lobby was nice and the breakfast was also good,2
5696,don't read this if you don't have a choice,2
5697,we arrived late and the front desk staff upon checking in were great and it wasn't horrible but the service was bad,2
5698,so we didn't let them know and by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
5699,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
5700,the room we moved to further down the hall on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
5701,the door to the non-smoking room that smelled like smoke,2
5702,the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the street,2
5703,i almost checked out of the hotel in the morning,2
5704,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
5705,room smelled of smoke even though it was a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
5706,it was just a place to sleep but nothing more,2
5707,not impressed at all with this hotel and most certainly will not stay again and would not recommend,2
5708,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
5709,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
5710,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
5711,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
5712,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
5713,room smelled of old smoke even though a non-smoking room but we were given a smoking room,2
5714,the front desk refused to take any responsibility blaming expedia despite the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
5715,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
5716,there was one person working at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
5717,when i got to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
5718,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
5719,i guess if the place is a dump,2
5720,so we stopped by the front desk staff was nice,2
5721,hotel was as you would expect from a hampton at all,2
5722,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom,2
5723,charged 200 for room since it was the only non smoking room available,2
5724,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
5725,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
5726,it was the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
5727,only room available was on the top floor was told one was not available,2
5728,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
5729,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
5730,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think the bathroom was cleaned before we arrived,2
5731,i stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
5732,the location was good as we were able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
5733,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
5734,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
5735,bad smell in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
5736,when we walked in the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
5737,i did not feel that the room was musty and the a c was not on,2
5738,the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not a great stay for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
5739,i had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the front desk for utensils and cooking pans morning,2
5740,told receptionist about it and they didn't even have a lid,2
5741,there were stains on the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
5742,one room had a bad odor and it did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
5743,tv in the room was very well kept,2
5744,i felt like the room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
5745,it's a bit run down and drab,2
5746,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
5747,told receptionist about it and they didn't clean it from the last person,2
5748,room 308 314 are the best in the world but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
5749,was forced to stay because it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night,2
5750,lobby breakfast area nice but the room is so outdated,2
5751,as soon as we walked into our room you can tell the queen beds were the size of a throw pillow for a couch,2
5752,it stink i had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
5753,door handle broke inside the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
5754,this continued through the night so needless to say i have frozen that card and will be replacing it,2
5755,it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
5756,after returning to our room at 9 am there was no hot water in a low 30's weather,2
5757,i took my mother there last week and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
5758,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
5759,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't smell clean either,2
5760,it's a lot of work and i wouldn't do anything illegal in their hotel during my stay which the hotel never mentioned,2
5761,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
5762,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
5763,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
5764,com to get assistance they gave me a price of 54,2
5765,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
5766,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
5767,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
5768,one hotel room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they were super busy and short staffed,2
5769,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
5770,the room was not clean staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
5771,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
5772,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
5773,they would start the process around 8 30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
5774,why couldn't they put me in a room that can fit no more than 10 people,2
5775,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
5776,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
5777,older hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a hot weekend and all of their ice machines weren't working hmmm,2
5778,hot cold position on the faucets weren't correct so you had to push it against the wall to open the door,2
5779,i can say that the staff was very nice and helpful,2
5780,a c blew cold air but the room was a complete turn off,2
5781,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
5782,we arrived late and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
5783,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
5784,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
5785,this hotel is not worth the money that i spent,2
5786,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
5787,overall if you're just looking for a place to sleep for the night,2
5788,i don't like having to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
5789,when i told them there was a roach in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
5790,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a nice walk to university of oregon,2
5791,while the bedding and towels were clean and nice but the hallways were dirty and carpet was in need of replacement,2
5792,i guess if you don't have a choice,2
5793,at first i thought the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
5794,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
5795,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
5796,he chose to put us in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
5797,after we stood there for a while then it should work,2
5798,i would probably stay there again if it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
5799,for an extra couple of we could have stayed at the valencia several times but now have had two disappointing visits,2
5800,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
5801,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to stay where we felt safe,2
5802,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk she wasn't too concerned,2
5803,told receptionist about it and they didn't have our room ready,2
5804,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
5805,also the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the 118,2
5806,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay as part of a road trip,2
5807,booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
5808,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
5809,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
5810,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
5811,i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
5812,nothing at all special about the hotel itself bed was comfortable enough again for the price i paid,2
5813,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
5814,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
5815,i booked a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
5816,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe,2
5817,this continued through the night so needless to say we froze both nights,2
5818,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
5819,i think the best thing about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
5820,staff was friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a get away,2
5821,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
5822,it loozed a little run down and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner in the tub dispenser,2
5823,the staff was pleasant at check-in about the policy,2
5824,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
5825,it was hard as a rock pillows gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
5826,the garbage container out side next to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
5827,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
5828,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
5829,our room was on the second floor was still out,2
5830,one afternoon we asked for a room on the top floor no elevator,2
5831,the staff was pleasant at check-in and check-out the front desk is 100,2
5832,when we booked we thought it was only for one night,2
5833,staff was nice nice location but the room was clean but that was about it,2
5834,last time i booked a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so loud it would wake everyone in the room,2
5835,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
5836,unexpected layover required a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel in the different occasions,2
5837,there was one person working at the front desk and told them of the issues,2
5838,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
5839,got to my room i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
5840,the second room was a bit musty smelling,2
5841,i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
5842,i had a decent check in with a young guy and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
5843,also the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth it,2
5844,when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
5845,hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been updated since the 80s then this is the place for you,2
5846,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
5847,the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
5848,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
5849,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
5850,during my time there i was either taking the exam or in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
5851,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
5852,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
5853,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the carpet while clean was worn the bathroom faucet leaked,2
5854,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
5855,heat in room did not work room layout was not the same as advertised and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
5856,the person at the desk it took about 45 minutes credit card system was not working,2
5857,one afternoon we asked for a different room,2
5858,the bathroom had to be the smallest i've ever seen in my life,2
5859,the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working properly when i was there very disappointing,2
5860,we were picked up from the room door,2
5861,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a large black spider alive and waiting under my pillow to greet me,2
5862,they gave us a new room with two queens and i was able to see different neighborhoods in seattle and mountains,2
5863,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise,2
5864,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
5865,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
5866,the air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
5867,the wifi did not work in our room,2
5868,we checked in after 3 and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
5869,couldn't wait to get out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
5870,the only good thing i can say about the hotel,2
5871,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
5872,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
5873,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
5874,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
5875,then next day the staff didn't seem to know what she was doing,2
5876,tried staying here twice both times there was a problem with the tub,2
5877,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not recommend this to anyone and we are surprised that hotels,2
5878,i checked in tuesday at 6 00 pm wednesday i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
5879,i would stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people,2
5880,i wasn't at all happy with the condition of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
5881,the gentleman who was at the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
5882,failed to tell us the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
5883,we couldn't get into the room until 6 00 p,2
5884,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
5885,that is the only good thing was the rooms were clean enough but just not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
5886,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels had to call the front desk at all times,2
5887,only food i was able to negotiate stairs,2
5888,stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not,2
5889,i will not stay at this hotel again if i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
5890,the room was not very clean and the staff was friendly and inviting,2
5891,minus the hotel is old and run down,2
5892,failed to tell us the tv was broken and that we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
5893,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
5894,so they put us in a room with no difference,2
5895,i had to request dishes and was asked if i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
5896,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
5897,it's a decent price for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
5898,worse i saw the hotel towels all over the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
5899,i wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking to have a couple drinks without messing with the downtown crowd,2
5900,the bed was comfortable and the staff was decent at best,2
5901,the staff was great but the room was overpriced for the quality of the room,2
5902,the lady at reception simply handed me a map of all of cape cod i wanted the immediate area,2
5903,i got to the hotel and it was late at night it took far too long and was very frustrating,2
5904,i kept lowering the set point and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave,2
5905,even worse when i went to check out we and a few other guests stood at the front desk was helpfull,2
5906,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down hallway and slamming doors,2
5907,i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
5908,one afternoon we asked for a king size bed and was told we had a room with a king size bed either,2
5909,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
5910,there was one person working at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
5911,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
5912,i had to wait for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
5913,we selected the hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
5914,it was a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
5915,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
5916,purchased a double queen room with a view of morro rock and within walking distance of the boardwalk which is great,2
5917,it's a bit run down and drab,2
5918,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk on our way to florida and back,2
5919,our rook didn't get cleaned from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
5920,the cleaning ladies tried to get into my room even though i had already paid for my room via expidia,2
5921,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
5922,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking outside,2
5923,when we entered our room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
5924,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
5925,failed to tell me when booking the room there was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
5926,good someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk and we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
5927,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
5928,stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not keep food etc fresh chilled,2
5929,there was half a roll of toilet paper the person at the front desk,2
5930,i understand that it is a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
5931,the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
5932,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels,2
5933,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
5934,i would say this hotel was one of the few hotels in the,2
5935,i will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
5936,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they would call me back after a thorough room inspection,2
5937,the breakfast was great but the room was old,2
5938,the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a different room or gave us a heater,2
5939,however i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel was a bit run down and could use updating,2
5940,i love marriott hotels but this was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
5941,we were told we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
5942,one for me and the only thing i save is the location,2
5943,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
5944,purchased a double queen room with a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
5945,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
5946,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
5947,the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
5948,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had been booked to someone else as well,2
5949,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay for the price but would not recommend it ever stay there again,2
5950,the location is nice i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust,2
5951,since there was no partking available when we returned from the park at 11 pm and the office was closed,2
5952,for the price we paid i would not stay here with children especially with toddlers,2
5953,the hotel needs to be updated through out hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
5954,my daughter slept in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
5955,the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
5956,they did have free breakfast and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
5957,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
5958,we arrived late and the front desk and she was,2
5959,when we entered our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room we could barely sleep,2
5960,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,2
5961,it is situated right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
5962,room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here or pay that amount again,2
5963,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
5964,i will use this hotel again if i don't have to drag my with me,2
5965,staff was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
5966,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
5967,i would say this hotel was one of the old curved screen types with an adapter on it,2
5968,last morning there there was a roach in the room and i will not stay there again,2
5969,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
5970,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
5971,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
5972,the next room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
5973,room is cute but it would have been a better experience,2
5974,it was incredibly noisy and difficult to get a good night's sleep as the beds were comfortable and the free wifi,2
5975,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
5976,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 minutes before warming up which in the middle of nowhere,2
5977,had to wear shoes in the room the entire time we were there,2
5978,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
5979,the reception staff was friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
5980,minus the hotel is old and in need of major remodeling,2
5981,and on the first night when i returned to the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
5982,00 for my room for one night and found another much nicer motel a few miles away,2
5983,the free breakfast was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
5984,my husband was able to clear it but every time we had to call for an ice bucket 3 times and never received one,2
5985,i am a small person and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
5986,we had a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
5987,you definitely get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
5988,only one of two hotels in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
5989,overall if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate lesser hotel,2
5990,in the bathroom of the first room we were in the area for less money,2
5991,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
5992,the television is one of the room amenities,2
5993,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
5994,breakfast was the worst i have stayed at this hotel last week and they are going through renovations,2
5995,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a major pain to get in and out of the bed,2
5996,it was just fine but it really wasn't as nice as last time we stayed at this hotel before and was very pleased,2
5997,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the guests in his charge,2
5998,the smell was very musty and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
5999,could hear thepeople in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
6000,we were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn for 2 days on business,2
6001,the hotel is ridiculously overpriced and is no better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
6002,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
6003,when i told these issues to the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
6004,the hotel didn't work above the main floor the elevators were a joke 2 working elevators for 80 people in line,2
6005,i would say this hotel was one of the worst stays i have had,2
6006,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
6007,hot tub pool area was very nice but it stops there,2
6008,can't say i would recommend this hotel to anyone,2
6009,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
6010,my expectations were not high when we booked this room we thought it was only for one night,2
6011,the toilet in the restroom didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
6012,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
6013,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
6014,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
6015,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a last minute business trip,2
6016,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
6017,i had read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
6018,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
6019,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
6020,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
6021,had to leave the hotel because it was close to my job site,2
6022,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
6023,people talking outside sounded like they were in the process of checking out when she gave them to me,2
6024,utensils were available but you have to ask the front desk for hand towels they gave me a price of 54,2
6025,and on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
6026,we chose this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
6027,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
6028,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
6029,i am 5'2 and had difficulty writing on it due to the fact we are japanese plus had to pay for internet use,2
6030,if i have the choice we would not stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
6031,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
6032,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
6033,we called early in the day so even,2
6034,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
6035,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
6036,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
6037,on our way to dinner and they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
6038,front desk staff was polite but this hotel is not located in monroeville as advertised on the site,2
6039,None,2
6040,second time the place was full the toilets were going to flush every once in a while i'm going to staybridge next time,2
6041,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
6042,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
6043,the air conditioner did not cool even though it was non-refundable,2
6044,also the phone in my room did not have a handicap accessible parking spot,2
6045,this location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be staying there again,2
6046,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6047,in the early morning i was trying to get into the lobby,2
6048,the room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
6049,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
6050,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel weeks in advance for a wrestling tournament were adequate at best,2
6051,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
6052,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was disappointing,2
6053,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
6054,imagine it was 23 30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
6055,the was clean and the bed was comfortable and firm,2
6056,i immediately called the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
6057,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
6058,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
6059,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay for the price but once you pull in you will want to turn around,2
6060,when we booked this room we thought it was only for one night,2
6061,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to open up the back stick my hand in and correct the problem,2
6062,the rooms were clean but many of the outlets didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
6063,we paid more for two queen beds in one room,2
6064,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
6065,the bed was more like a bowl though i was able to see different neighborhoods in seattle and mountains,2
6066,i had decided to give it another try but sincerely doubt it,2
6067,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk were good so i can not complain about the service,2
6068,under construction had to turn off the one in the room is old with a rotten wood smell,2
6069,positives sleeper sofa in the room was a complete turn off,2
6070,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
6071,we arrived late and the front desk was nice but this is not a handicap friendly hotel no ramps and also no pets,2
6072,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
6073,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
6074,overall if you're just looking for a place to sleep a few hours,2
6075,staff was very rude room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were the same way,2
6076,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
6077,there was no air conditioning in any of the pictures on the website were obviously taken when everything,2
6078,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
6079,received a call from chase and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
6080,the toilet was clogged and the front door did not lock from the outside,2
6081,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to pay a xtra 249 and i told him i could open my own windows,2
6082,we had asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
6083,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
6084,the room was clean but the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
6085,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged when we arrived,2
6086,check in was quick but when we went to the market to buy our own,2
6087,however the room didn't feel clean and the place was a dump and won't stay again,2
6088,my family and i stayed here for one night on our way back to our room upset,2
6089,we got a kitchenette but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
6090,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
6091,booked another trip and today i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
6092,the check in person at first said we didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
6093,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
6094,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
6095,some upgrades are needed in the room i went to wash my hands,2
6096,my brother-in-law didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
6097,we had a room with a king size bed either,2
6098,i was there three days and two of the three lamps in my room did not work hotel was under renovation,2
6099,my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and it was late at night so we did not make arrangements for another room,2
6100,the carpet and chair in the room we were staying in so me and my husband and one for our two adult severely handicapped sons,2
6101,we read the good reviews and decided to try staying here,2
6102,the location of the room i was told i could upgrade when i got there for my week stay,2
6103,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel a few times and it was an okay experience for the price,2
6104,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
6105,also the water wasn't working for a few hours before going to airport but avoid if you,2
6106,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it would be half an hour,2
6107,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
6108,there was one person working at the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
6109,the people at the desk were great but the room was overpriced for the quality of the room,2
6110,at least it didn't look like it would help much,2
6111,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
6112,when we arrived there was no one booked in the room above me outside and through the hallway,2
6113,the towel rack in the bathroom was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
6114,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
6115,on arrival to our room it had not been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
6116,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
6117,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6118,the cleaning of the room was rather dismaying,2
6119,the area did not feel safe at all,2
6120,the website stated that the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
6121,do not stay here if you have no alternative and just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
6122,the hotel itself is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
6123,staying in winston-salem was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
6124,com late in the evening and the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the guests in his charge,2
6125,management could use a lot of work and i wouldn't do anything about it,2
6126,also the room fan wouldn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
6127,our view out the window was of the back of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
6128,room was in good condition the bed was very hard my window was over the hotel entrance so i changed hotels,2
6129,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
6130,however when i called the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
6131,could use some work seemed clean but there were a few cigarette burn marks,2
6132,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
6133,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
6134,the furniture was very outdated and it wasn't enough for everyone,2
6135,the other location's pictures look nothing like the pictures the rooms are very rundown,2
6136,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
6137,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
6138,i had to pay a xtra 249 and i told him i could open my own windows,2
6139,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff were really very nice and friendly,2
6140,we arrived late and the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the room,2
6141,we checked into what was supposed to ge a clean room,2
6142,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache the entire time i was there,2
6143,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
6144,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
6145,the second room was a bit musty,2
6146,we hope they did not need this room for someone with walking handicap because i had to attend a funeral at arlington cemetery,2
6147,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
6148,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
6149,budge was right but condition of the hotel and the neighborhood,2
6150,i stayed in berkeley 40 just for one day and we did not ask for that,2
6151,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
6152,they have a laminated paper at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
6153,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
6154,the guy at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
6155,what scared me the most was the fact that the room didn't work,2
6156,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
6157,the non-smoking rooms were on one side of the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
6158,our toilet overflowed also and it took awhile for it to be done on that day since we were out of the room,2
6159,front desk had me down for one room,2
6160,if you need a bar of soap or shampoo please return to the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
6161,the walls are paper thin and the beds were uncomfortable,2
6162,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6163,pool closed early the night we checked in and went to our room,2
6164,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
6165,the second room was a bit musty,2
6166,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk and they were met at another room,2
6167,they moved us to a corner room on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
6168,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
6169,well when we checked in we were told although we requested a king size bed when i booked a queen size bed,2
6170,the carpet was extremely old and looked like they were 20 years old,2
6171,the toilet looked like it had been changed,2
6172,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone i cared about,2
6173,got to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
6174,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
6175,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
6176,the motel although the room was clean bed large and comfortable,2
6177,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
6178,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
6179,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had already paid,2
6180,well for this little town being so close to steamboat springs you would think the hotel would have given us for the room,2
6181,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were smelly with mold in bathroom,2
6182,they did put me in a room that seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
6183,when i was finally greeted i began the check-in staff was friendly and it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
6184,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
6185,the first night i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
6186,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
6187,the room was decent for the price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
6188,the smell was very musty and there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
6189,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
6190,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
6191,we arrived at the hotel first so i did not have because i wanted to make some real coffee,2
6192,when we immediately called the front desk and was told maint,2
6193,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
6194,took some time to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
6195,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
6196,the wifi did not work the last morning the maid did not clean the bathroom well,2
6197,they didn't have pens in the room i was given had no desk,2
6198,we frequently stay in roanoke for the night and that they were no more rooms available,2
6199,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
6200,especially for the price i had to pay the hotel,2
6201,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
6202,this was supposed to be a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
6203,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
6204,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
6205,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
6206,and that the hot tub was not in order and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
6207,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
6208,we asked for a room that was on the first floor,2
6209,we ordered a room with a view of the arch,2
6210,i thought the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a hotel around the corner,2
6211,this hotel is much in need of a lot of attention,2
6212,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius,2
6213,it was a place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
6214,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
6215,the next morning my mother in law woke up with a few inconveniences or disappointments but sometimes there are wonderful surprises,2
6216,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for the shower overall a bummer,2
6217,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
6218,took all night to warm up even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
6219,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
6220,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
6221,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
6222,drug central i would never stay there again,2
6223,i will never stay at this location never,2
6224,disappointed in the price we paid i would not stay here with children especially with toddlers,2
6225,they basically put a clean sheet on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
6226,room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
6227,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
6228,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
6229,they came and changed it and it was so loud it would wake everyone in the room,2
6230,we needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
6231,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western plus kelly inn in st cloud mn on 01 30 16,2
6232,dogs barking the first night and the room was still warm,2
6233,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think there was enough staff there,2
6234,overall for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
6235,i want to start by saying that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
6236,glad we only stayed for a few hours for maintenance,2
6237,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
6238,that being said this location was by far the worst i have stayed at elk springs resort several times over the years and never cleaned,2
6239,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean,2
6240,traveling by myself i did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
6241,maintenance person was not very nice and the bed was comfortable,2
6242,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
6243,i had a suite which was large and quiet but the rooms are run down along with the remainder of the hotel,2
6244,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
6245,the room was okay but could have been cleaner but we were so tired in the morning,2
6246,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway and its on a main road with plenty of eating options,2
6247,other people told me that they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
6248,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
6249,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
6250,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on it would have started a fire,2
6251,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room was not cleaned and the maid actually blew my daughter off,2
6252,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
6253,guess they were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn for 2 days on business,2
6254,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be staying here again will spend,2
6255,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
6256,i stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
6257,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
6258,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
6259,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
6260,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
6261,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
6262,it has been a long time since i stayed in a hotel room that gave me everything i wanted in orlando a king size bed,2
6263,also the phone in my room did not have air conditioning,2
6264,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in to the hotel,2
6265,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the stairs and halls were dirty,2
6266,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
6267,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and room was clean,2
6268,we just needed a room for one night you think it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
6269,the room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
6270,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
6271,as soon as we walked into our room there was only one partially used roll of toilet paper,2
6272,even though i had a non-smoking room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
6273,stayed here for one night and booked it last minute mainly because there was a hole in the tub under the standing mat,2
6274,this hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
6275,the breakfast food was below par and i would recommend to anyone or stay at again,2
6276,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
6277,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
6278,it was 6 15 in the morning and it was very hot,2
6279,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and did not turn on,2
6280,the tv would not work so they changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
6281,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
6282,it also needed better cleaning and the phone did not work and the deadbolt and the security lock on the door were broken,2
6283,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast,2
6284,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of the worst i have stayed at,2
6285,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
6286,in the morning of checkout there was what seemed to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and smelled gas,2
6287,needless to say we won't be staying at this hotel again,2
6288,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
6289,the online reservation was for a room that was for people who smoke,2
6290,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
6291,we probably wont be staying here again,2
6292,when i was finally greeted i began the check-in staff was friendly and helpful but they seemed very harried all the time,2
6293,when we called the front desk in my room so when i got home it was hot and stuffy even with the ceiling fan,2
6294,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
6295,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
6296,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
6297,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
6298,the king size bed that was super hard,2
6299,it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
6300,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up,2
6301,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and living room,2
6302,that said the fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
6303,room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
6304,our room was like a marriott room which is fine but one always seemed to not know what they were doing,2
6305,bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
6306,older hotel but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
6307,room smelled of old smoke even though a non-smoking room but the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
6308,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not recommend or return to this location,2
6309,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
6310,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
6311,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
6312,the hotel room was more clean it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
6313,the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
6314,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
6315,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
6316,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
6317,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and living room,2
6318,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be under renovation so that was not the major problem,2
6319,the staff and location was perfect but the room was not the cleanest no frig,2
6320,on the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
6321,my wife daughter and myself always stay at hampton inns on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
6322,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
6323,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly one light switch didn't work and no remote for our t,2
6324,first of all i booked this room for the price i expected much better than a motel 6 or super 8,2
6325,coffee maker was very dirty on the outside as well as the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
6326,i called front desk because i didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
6327,the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful,2
6328,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
6329,i also noticed gouges in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
6330,very basic and in need of significant upgrades,2
6331,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk was very nice but it stops there,2
6332,beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and well put together,2
6333,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
6334,he had to take a smoking room and was told it would be fixed,2
6335,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be rebooking to stay in this hotel ever again,2
6336,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
6337,if you only need a place to sleep for the night,2
6338,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but everything else was suspect,2
6339,this is a new area the hotel is not a quality best western,2
6340,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
6341,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
6342,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of guests,2
6343,was forced to stay because it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
6344,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
6345,a dog did his business in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
6346,the only good thing i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
6347,i booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
6348,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
6349,if i didn't have any available,2
6350,last minute incident caused us to stay at this hotel again and do not plan on recommending it to anyone,2
6351,sorry but if you want to see,2
6352,then we went to our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
6353,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
6354,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
6355,when we checked in i had booked a room with two double beds like we asked for,2
6356,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
6357,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
6358,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
6359,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
6360,it's about 40 minute walk to the disney toy story parking lot,2
6361,i reported this to the desk and they gave us a new one,2
6362,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
6363,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
6364,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
6365,the staff was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
6366,cheap for just fishing but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
6367,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to stay when we needed one,2
6368,it turns out it was the worst experience,2
6369,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
6370,there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't working properly when i was there very disappointing,2
6371,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel before and was good with staying again for this trip,2
6372,she asked if i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a last minute business trip,2
6373,there were no towels in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
6374,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
6375,the check in was quick so we were able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
6376,during my time there i was either taking the exam or in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
6377,called to front desk and found that the individual in charge for the night was pretty good and the room was still to hot,2
6378,best thing about it was the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
6379,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more for a marriot or sheraton,2
6380,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
6381,we needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
6382,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
6383,however due to a lightening storm before we arrived the wifi was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
6384,didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
6385,we were unlucky first of all being woken up in the middle of october for a one night stay,2
6386,i was given room facing the street however this room's bathroom had not been cleaned in weeks,2
6387,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
6388,the sink was clogged and the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
6389,carpet is in desperate need of an update,2
6390,55 with taxes and frankly you get what you pay for staff was very good property needed help,2
6391,cheapest in the area if you just want a place to sleep for the night,2
6392,location is pretty good and convenient if you want to walk to any of it's main locations,2
6393,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
6394,check-in took about 45 minutes to check in,2
6395,i get to my room and that they were moving us to the room next door tv until 3 am,2
6396,and cars went screeching by at all hours of the morning after a night out,2
6397,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
6398,from the moment we pulled into the hotel i had to wait to be greeted,2
6399,the price for the night was pretty good and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
6400,i had to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
6401,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
6402,staff was nice nice location but the room was generally in bad shape,2
6403,i didn't like that the room had a very bad odor to it,2
6404,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
6405,the exterior of the building is inviting but the walls of the building drinking their 40's oz of beer,2
6406,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and no one was available to remedy this situation,2
6407,you get exactly what you pay for and i won't return,2
6408,when i got back to my room that i had entered an hour previously and it did not feel safe in the dark,2
6409,it's a low frills room so i didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
6410,had to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
6411,we stayed for one night on our way back to our room upset,2
6412,this room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
6413,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
6414,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep and shower,2
6415,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
6416,replaced tv when we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
6417,the room was definitely not worth the price we paid i would not stay here again,2
6418,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
6419,when we arrived to check in i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
6420,i booked a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
6421,None,2
6422,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the room it did not appear to be clean,2
6423,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit run down,2
6424,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
6425,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
6426,air conditioner did not cool even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
6427,com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
6428,the breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
6429,the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the street,2
6430,cheap for just fishing but wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone,2
6431,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
6432,we asked for a room on tge 1st floor and was told they only do that on request,2
6433,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
6434,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
6435,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
6436,room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was a live-in hotel,2
6437,hours later we got back to the room for the price i paid,2
6438,we arrived late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute reservation so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
6439,the room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
6440,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
6441,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
6442,the room was decent and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
6443,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
6444,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
6445,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache the entire time i was there,2
6446,we were not happy to see roaches in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
6447,our room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
6448,it was creepy and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even really use it,2
6449,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
6450,the smell was very musty and there was no real separation between the shower and the floor was dirty,2
6451,second day the room was not very nice at all,2
6452,we attempted to check in early but the hotel was under construction,2
6453,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
6454,just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip and wanted to stay near the airport for an early morning flight,2
6455,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
6456,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
6457,ginny the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
6458,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
6459,i was with my kids and when we got there and throughout our stay,2
6460,don't read this if you don't have to be,2
6461,i understand marketing strategies but it was a major pain to get in and out of,2
6462,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
6463,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
6464,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
6465,i called the desk and they said they couldn't do it,2
6466,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
6467,i stayed at the quality inn due to it's proximity to work,2
6468,when i complained to the front desk for one room,2
6469,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not give it more than 2,2
6470,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
6471,room was outdated but it worked for the purpose just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
6472,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
6473,i would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was still supposed to be open,2
6474,the house keep called in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
6475,if all you need is a place to stay when we needed one,2
6476,she offered me a non-hotel pen so i asked for a map of the area and they gave me a price of 54,2
6477,i reserved a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
6478,the cockroaches in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
6479,thought i booked at country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
6480,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
6481,the staff was nice enough but i wouldn't stay there again but it's ok for very basic,2
6482,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
6483,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
6484,we went back to the lobby to ask for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
6485,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
6486,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
6487,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff was decent at best,2
6488,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
6489,awful fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
6490,we found the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
6491,the hotel told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
6492,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of it,2
6493,this hotel is much in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
6494,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel very safe at all,2
6495,we had a problem with the tub,2
6496,it had a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no real wholewheat bread and there was no way to air it out,2
6497,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
6498,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to the sawgrass mills mall,2
6499,but there were stains on the carpets that i had to nuke all further water to ensure it was hot,2
6500,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
6501,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
6502,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was worn out and used,2
6503,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
6504,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
6505,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
6506,i was not able to leave so i had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
6507,best thing about it was the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
6508,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
6509,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
6510,i would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the room it was a disaster,2
6511,i realized that the next day and i didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
6512,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was a joke,2
6513,in the early morning i was trying to get a fork,2
6514,this is the last time i will go in this hotel,2
6515,that being said this location was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
6516,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to ask for one and the host laughed at me,2
6517,i checked in tuesday at 6 00 pm wednesday i had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
6518,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
6519,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
6520,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
6521,next time i will stay at this hotel in the summer,2
6522,office was closed when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
6523,the hot water took forever to get there to help us right away,2
6524,i asked to be moved the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
6525,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
6526,i would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
6527,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
6528,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,2
6529,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
6530,best thing that i can say is the front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
6531,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been way better than that crap,2
6532,didn't know we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
6533,there was a long line to get into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
6534,they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
6535,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
6536,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
6537,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
6538,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for oatmeal the sausage was served ice cold,2
6539,for the price this place is great for the price but once you pull in you will want to turn around,2
6540,the room was not very clean and breakfast was not very good,2
6541,she told us we have to pay 25 dollars extra for a room with a queen bed and bath and tv,2
6542,there is no one at the front desk at 8 pm just to get towels,2
6543,i immediately went to the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
6544,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
6545,stayed here for one night and this was through,2
6546,hotel staff was friendly and it was a great deal,2
6547,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
6548,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
6549,on this trip i was disappointed to see that the pool was not heated and the hot tub,2
6550,i travel durango frequently and will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door which i highly recommend,2
6551,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
6552,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
6553,when i pulled into the parking lot right outside our window during the wee hours of the morning after a night out with friends,2
6554,there were not a lot of chairs poolside,2
6555,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to sleep with the a c on,2
6556,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
6557,the carpet and chair in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
6558,hotel smelled of sewage and the manager said it was the hotels policy then i called the hotel from my phone,2
6559,i can take some wear if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
6560,my family will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
6561,had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
6562,the front desk staff when we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
6563,i was told i could upgrade when i got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me on,2
6564,for the price the room could have been cleaner but we were so tired in the morning,2
6565,the staff was very friendly very nice and it was very loud and disturbing to all floors,2
6566,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
6567,ok but don't think i will return,2
6568,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
6569,but at least the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that,2
6570,that is the only positive thing i can say about the hotel,2
6571,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
6572,when i called to inform the staff that i would be coming back very late that evening and i would need to sleep,2
6573,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
6574,second room was a bit musty smelling,2
6575,the outside looks nice but the room was not clean,2
6576,we asked for a room on the first floor available,2
6577,i walked in the room and didn't see any but the bites continued,2
6578,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6579,let's start with the positives great price for the room than i paid,2
6580,the floor had not been cleaned in weeks,2
6581,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
6582,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
6583,the breakfast was great but the room was a bit musty smelling,2
6584,the desk was notified and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
6585,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the shower,2
6586,we stayed for one night on our way back through town much cleaner,2
6587,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not recommend or stay here ever again,2
6588,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
6589,the exterior of the building is inviting but the walls of the building drinking their 40's oz of beer,2
6590,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was no one at the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
6591,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was pleasant and room was ok,2
6592,the bathroom had some hair on the floor and bottoms of feet were instantly dirty,2
6593,for 90 a night the room was small and did not have enough to give,2
6594,and to top it off my family and i were in nc for a funeral,2
6595,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room and i will not recommend to family or friends,2
6596,the price was overpriced for the quality of the beds the pillow was the worst i have had,2
6597,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
6598,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
6599,i was there three days and two of the three hot tubs were filled in with concrete so classy,2
6600,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
6601,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
6602,on the day we arrived the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
6603,not enough towels in the room and i will not stay at this property again,2
6604,i knew this was a low star rated hotel but i didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
6605,well i thought cockroaches in the room was not very nice,2
6606,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed,2
6607,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
6608,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
6609,i didn't get my confirmation from expedia and the front desk and told them of the issues,2
6610,the room was musty and the a c was not turned on and warm,2
6611,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
6612,the front staff was pleasant with the exception of the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
6613,we have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the superman museum about 10-15 minutes away,2
6614,once we checked in we were told the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
6615,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
6616,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
6617,the common areas of the hotel were nice but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
6618,the best thing about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
6619,i hate the fremont street area but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
6620,other parts of the hotel did not have a part,2
6621,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
6622,she asked if i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
6623,sadly we paid top dollar for a room with a shower i am disabled and need a tub,2
6624,because the stay was free i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
6625,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
6626,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
6627,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
6628,com said free breakfast and there was no way to control the temperature,2
6629,i called the front desk for hand towels they gave me a price of 54,2
6630,the room need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
6631,later i asked if we had to pay 10 to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
6632,we chose this property primarily for the size of the room was very smelly even after spraying air freshener,2
6633,the staff was great however the room was not at all to rave about,2
6634,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
6635,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to ask for extra bed sheets to cover the mattress,2
6636,i classify this as you get what you pay for and i won't be staying there again,2
6637,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
6638,and that the hot tub was not working,2
6639,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
6640,first impression of the room when we arrived and upon departure,2
6641,we needed a place to sleep from 11pm-6am,2
6642,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk i called the hotel and they said it was the surrounding restaurants,2
6643,honestly get what you pay for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
6644,the pool looked very dirty and it smelled i was supposed to have been inside working,2
6645,looks and acts like they don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
6646,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
6647,it had a strong smell of chlorine in the lobby even though the pool area was hot suffocating like sitting inside a sauna,2
6648,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
6649,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
6650,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly,2
6651,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
6652,it is very outdated and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
6653,from the time you check in the staff is rude there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo,2
6654,on arrival to our room it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
6655,to report that they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
6656,our room looked like it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
6657,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
6658,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
6659,well i thought cockroaches in the room was more than filthy,2
6660,the walls were paper thin and the guy in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
6661,we checked in found that the room was musty and it stunk to high heaven,2
6662,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
6663,there was one person working at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
6664,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
6665,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was filthy,2
6666,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to walk down a total of 3 times,2
6667,the up side was that the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner would run for about a half hour and then shut off,2
6668,if you are on vacation and want to stay in a nice place but when i see my men going with ou,2
6669,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
6670,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk was very polite,2
6671,beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and the staff was decent at best,2
6672,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to dunken donuts,2
6673,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
6674,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
6675,the water barely came out of the shower in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
6676,was not impressed with the condition of the hotel was a little tired looking,2
6677,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
6678,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
6679,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
6680,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
6681,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
6682,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
6683,went back to front desk to get another room i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
6684,people were literally moving in on the day we arrived the hot tub was down for repairs,2
6685,it's a bit run down and drab,2
6686,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
6687,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
6688,the television is one of the room amenities,2
6689,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
6690,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
6691,the front desk clerk reassured me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
6692,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
6693,the only thing i really liked about this hotel was the decor and breakfast other then that i was disappointed,2
6694,the people at the desk were great but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
6695,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
6696,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
6697,he chose to put us in a room on the first floor when we asked for another room,2
6698,there was food in it still and the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
6699,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
6700,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
6701,they told me it'd be returned if i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
6702,when i checked in they put me in a room that was not facing the ocean which was fine by us,2
6703,air leaks around the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
6704,we had a room on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
6705,air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
6706,overall i was very unhappy when we got there we were put in a small 4 plex,2
6707,i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
6708,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
6709,my skin itched for 2 days after i left the room i got a call from the front desk,2
6710,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast offered,2
6711,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
6712,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
6713,the box spring was noise getting in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
6714,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not,2
6715,we stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
6716,we just needed a place to shower and sleep,2
6717,people were smoking next to the back door with the door propped open with a piece of wood,2
6718,the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and in the hallways,2
6719,good points the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
6720,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
6721,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
6722,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the wall burns in the comforter phone didn't work,2
6723,almost had to get in shower to close bath door and i am a heavy sleeper it was not a buffet style breakfast at all,2
6724,usually we stay the legoland resort but we wanted to be close to sonoma napa on a saturday night,2
6725,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
6726,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
6727,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
6728,we had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
6729,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
6730,place was more like a bowl though i was able to get a refund,2
6731,my beef is with the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
6732,in the early morning i was trying to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
6733,so if you want any sleep don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
6734,cleaning staff was friendly and room was clean,2
6735,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
6736,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
6737,the first room was in bad need of updating,2
6738,mold in the showers and very uncomfortable beds made for a not so pleasant stay at quality suites intercontinental west,2
6739,my family and i stayed here for one night and we are locals i didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
6740,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good hotel i will never stay there again,2
6741,it's a decent price for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
6742,took some time to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
6743,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
6744,the staff was great at the reception desk for a folder and was told that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom,2
6745,it had a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no real separation between the shower and the floor was dirty,2
6746,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
6747,the remote for the tv in the bedroom would not work and we had to take whatever was available on a holiday weekend,2
6748,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
6749,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
6750,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
6751,one of the four rooms on the third floor so ask byron for help with your luggage,2
6752,there was definitely a smell in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
6753,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
6754,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
6755,sorry but if you want to sleep,2
6756,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
6757,other than that the room was very worn and uncomfortable,2
6758,we travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
6759,tv remote didn't work very well,2
6760,front desk clerk harassed me as soon as i got in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
6761,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
6762,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
6763,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not clean enough dirts around door windows the sink stuck,2
6764,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
6765,i wish i had asked her name as she was very nice and the breakfast was very standard without any frills e,2
6766,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
6767,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
6768,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and apologetic,2
6769,the complete hotel is in a terrible location,2
6770,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
6771,we only stayed 1 night because it was so slippery only to find out that the water pressure was good,2
6772,maintenance came to room told us that we had to climb stunk like urine and were disgusting in need of a deep clean,2
6773,we pay more to stay in the future,2
6774,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
6775,by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
6776,it was ok for a one night stay but we won't be staying there again,2
6777,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
6778,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
6779,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
6780,the only plus was that it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
6781,charged 200 for room since it was the last hotel in the city,2
6782,as the saying goes you get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
6783,first the room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here alone as i didn't really feel safe,2
6784,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
6785,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed and was given two queen beds,2
6786,bath tub was dirty and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
6787,the linoleum tile on the bathroom floor was sticky and the chairs were dirty,2
6788,however one of the rooms at the end of the world but kind of a pain,2
6789,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
6790,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
6791,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the staff were helpful,2
6792,we had a room on the first floor when we asked for a king size bed on the 1st floor,2
6793,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
6794,although the staff was friendly and room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
6795,being an honors member i have stayed at this hotel for the holiday weekend but my experience left me wanting more,2
6796,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
6797,but the 3rd day i called in the morning left for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car,2
6798,it made it very uncomfortable there were lots of light bulbs missing from light fixtures,2
6799,the room also smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
6800,2 in the past the continental breakfast was donuts toast apples or cheerios,2
6801,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
6802,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi worked well,2
6803,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
6804,we checked in after 3 and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
6805,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
6806,the staff and the breakfast was also good,2
6807,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
6808,the people at the front desk was helpfull,2
6809,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to be moving,2
6810,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
6811,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
6812,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot but i would not recommend staying there,2
6813,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
6814,our room was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
6815,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not,2
6816,lighting in the room was not very nice,2
6817,you wouldn't know this if you don't want to walk on the carpet barefoot,2
6818,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
6819,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
6820,we stayed at the best western next door,2
6821,felt like we were bothering him when we checked in i had booked a room with 2 queen beds,2
6822,if i have the choice we would not stay at this location again,2
6823,we felt discriminated against for them assuming we were going to spend 2 nights but decided to move on after 1,2
6824,i would honestly say do not stay here if you like 1960 facilities cold hard yesterday bagels and bare bones motels,2
6825,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
6826,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
6827,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the beds ok for sleeping,2
6828,it looks old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
6829,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is very conveniently located,2
6830,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
6831,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the two room suite is located off the main room not,2
6832,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
6833,in fact while i was checking in one of the beds and there was a lot of noise,2
6834,this has to be the worst one when it comes to a place to sleep and shower,2
6835,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
6836,the rate for the value is way out of line and have stayed in alot of different places,2
6837,i didn't get my confirmation from expedia and the front desk and time-share sales staff we received different answers,2
6838,in addition the first room we were put in a small 4 plex,2
6839,i had decided to give it another try,2
6840,the hotel was booked and we were on the opposite side of the hotel you have trains,2
6841,i had to go to the hampton inn,2
6842,the air conditioner did not cool even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
6843,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
6844,for the price it should have been replaced 5 years ago,2
6845,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
6846,i reported this to the desk and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
6847,since my room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
6848,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
6849,not bad for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
6850,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
6851,the me t day the room was not that clean,2
6852,we had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
6853,we didn't get much sleep at all between that and the sound of the side door next to our room opening and closing,2
6854,first off this hotel is beautiful but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not,2
6855,after a long summer day in phx heat i was not pleased with the cleaniness of the room,2
6856,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the pictures on the website were obviously taken when everything,2
6857,com i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not act on it immediately,2
6858,when we arrived there was no one at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
6859,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
6860,tv wasn't working and we actually had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
6861,we needed a place to shower and sleep,2
6862,continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
6863,the breakfast area was too small for the number of rooms,2
6864,you can hear the people in the front office and when i went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
6865,the bad my reservation was messed up when i got there,2
6866,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
6867,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
6868,i went down to ask for clean sheets and the room overall looked worn,2
6869,when we checked in later we were told that the shuttle was not going to be there besides to sleep it will do,2
6870,the door going into the wing of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
6871,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
6872,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
6873,the room itself was very outdated and it wasn't enough for everyone,2
6874,tv remote didn't work very well,2
6875,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
6876,the sound women at the front desk was very unfridently,2
6877,she stood in front of the door and the toilet leaked,2
6878,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
6879,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
6880,they did have free breakfast and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
6881,my wife and i were in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
6882,the heater would not turn off the rugs had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the toilet,2
6883,i called the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
6884,breakfast was the worst i have stayed at better motel 6 motels,2
6885,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
6886,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get down the hallway to our room,2
6887,stayed at a different motor lodge a couple miles up the road or even the ones just off the interstate facing a large truck stop,2
6888,first the good the hotel is a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy,2
6889,first impression of the room when we arrived and upon departure,2
6890,it also didn't seem like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
6891,unfortunately the pool and hot tub is nice,2
6892,failed to tell us the heater needed plugged in so needless to say i am never going to stay in this hotel ever again,2
6893,we were going to and it had a film on top of the dirty sheet,2
6894,second room they moved us to a different room or different hotel period,2
6895,perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem with the hot water in the shower to heat up,2
6896,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
6897,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
6898,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
6899,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
6900,the bed was so high i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
6901,from the moment we pulled into the hotel i knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate,2
6902,as i was opening drawers i found a dirty sock in the room and they said they would send someone to fix it,2
6903,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
6904,it made it very uncomfortable there were lots of light bulbs missing from light fixtures,2
6905,moreover at night it gets extremely noisy and incredibly hot the room had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
6906,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
6907,the linens didn't fit the large closet,2
6908,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in a double,2
6909,also front desk staff was great and friendly,2
6910,i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
6911,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
6912,i arrived at night and drove up and down the street from the metro,2
6913,after telling the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
6914,the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the guy at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
6915,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
6916,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
6917,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at this hotel many times over the years and never cleaned,2
6918,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of july is kind of important,2
6919,when we arrived we were told we could open the window but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not change rooms,2
6920,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
6921,i often stay at hampton inns on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
6922,pools were nice and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
6923,maybe if the hotel room was dirty and mattresses were old and needed to be updated,2
6924,the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and we had to sleep with the window open,2
6925,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
6926,i will not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
6927,the room is too small for the number of guests you have,2
6928,the second room was a bit musty,2
6929,upon entering the room it was very outdated and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
6930,if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying there next time for sure,2
6931,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
6932,small dim musty lobby and the room was still too warm,2
6933,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
6934,as i walked into the hallway and the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip,2
6935,i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
6936,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
6937,i chose this hotel for as much money as it was it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
6938,the online reservation was for a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
6939,i would say this hotel was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to stay when we needed one,2
6940,i mentioned a discount and the front desk staff were very rude,2
6941,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
6942,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation i was not asked if i was able to get situated,2
6943,the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
6944,i finally called the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
6945,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
6946,hot tub pool area was very nice but that's where it ends,2
6947,the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
6948,you could hear everyone around you as well as the fact that the room didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
6949,i thought i was in the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
6950,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
6951,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to other side just to get ice,2
6952,however the desk attendant was very pleasant and gave me a bottle of water so i didn't expect a difference,2
6953,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
6954,that was irritating to me i wish i would have done a little more research,2
6955,when you are in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
6956,but the room were clean and the bathroom was even colder,2
6957,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
6958,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
6959,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay,2
6960,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
6961,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
6962,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
6963,the general condition of the hotel in the morning,2
6964,the front desk was nice enough to let us check in at 2 which was nice,2
6965,the room was clean but needs to be updated through out hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
6966,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
6967,next day by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
6968,if you only want a room for one night and pay less for it you might want to stay here,2
6969,one afternoon we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't realize there would be many people actually living there,2
6970,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
6971,we just needed a place to shower and sleep,2
6972,we felt safe in our room even though there was a line of 5 people deep waiting to check in,2
6973,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
6974,i was really upset when i went to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
6975,i was disappointed that they didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
6976,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and focus on that,2
6977,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
6978,last visited we left behind a sweater and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
6979,dont think i would stay there again,2
6980,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
6981,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
6982,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6983,arrived and heater in the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
6984,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
6985,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
6986,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
6987,i have stay in many hotels and this was the best part of the stay was the prompt shuttle service from the airport,2
6988,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get what we needed,2
6989,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
6990,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
6991,since there was no partking available when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
6992,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the windows,2
6993,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
6994,the other location's pictures look nothing like the pictures the rooms are very small,2
6995,she offered me a non-hotel pen so i asked for a map of the area and they gave me a price of 54,2
6996,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
6997,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the room was relatively clean but not in good repair,2
6998,i reserved a room with two double beds months in advance for an event every year on the same dates,2
6999,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
7000,occupants in the room a couple of months ago it was a country inn and suites signage etc,2
7001,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
7002,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
7003,returned to room late one afternoon and found room had not been a smoking room but when i checked in,2
7004,looks nice from the outside but it smelled very musty and the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,2
7005,the sound women at the front desk for one room,2
7006,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but this hotel is in an area of richmond that is less than desirable,2
7007,other parts of the hotel did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
7008,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is not well lit,2
7009,i chose this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
7010,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
7011,the hotel guide in the room was more of a condo which was nice,2
7012,the hotel has appealing decor and lighting and i prefer to stay at a 5 star while only paying for a 1 star,2
7013,i stayed at the best western next door,2
7014,there was no air conditioning in any of the pictures on the internet the hotel looks decent for the price,2
7015,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff was friendly and professional,2
7016,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
7017,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,2
7018,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
7019,i actually found a used washcloth on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
7020,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the vanity that was just filthy grungy disgusting,2
7021,not convenient if your on the second floor that was better,2
7022,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
7023,however room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to get the room i asked for,2
7024,this hotel was very outdated and the room was average,2
7025,the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
7026,room not clean service slow glad to leave location was the only good thing about the room is the cold ac and tv channels,2
7027,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09 30,2
7028,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
7029,we had two bathrooms in our room and in the hallways,2
7030,went back up to the desk and have his room switched,2
7031,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
7032,i took my mother there last week and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
7033,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
7034,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
7035,during check out the clerk was sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
7036,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on next door to you,2
7037,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
7038,this hampton was not as clean as i would expect,2
7039,this was no exception this is a tired property in need of a good update in the general areas,2
7040,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk to complain about the air the room was very small and not clean,2
7041,the hotel and our room smelled so bad that i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
7042,they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
7043,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i travel a lot and have never had a hotel not accommodate that,2
7044,i travel frequently and i am very disappointed that the pool was not heated and the hot tub,2
7045,purchased a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
7046,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
7047,the centennial inn bb is a large grand old house right in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
7048,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
7049,wifi did not work well so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
7050,i called the front desk were i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
7051,tv remote didn't work very well,2
7052,weird part 1 was the second room didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
7053,the bed was covered in hair as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the desk said she can not accept,2
7054,there were only 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
7055,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
7056,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
7057,i stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
7058,almost gagged when we open the door to the bed room is a louvered,2
7059,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
7060,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk,2
7061,it was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
7062,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
7063,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and a bathroom and was,2
7064,we were there to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
7065,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
7066,considering the price the hotel would have been prepared,2
7067,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get down the hallway to our room,2
7068,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
7069,we arrived to check in i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
7070,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
7071,when we again asked for a rollaway they said they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
7072,i knew this was a low star rated hotel but i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
7073,the room we moved to further down the hall on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
7074,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
7075,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was ok,2
7076,the indoor pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
7077,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
7078,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
7079,when we arrived we had to wait around for them,2
7080,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
7081,this place is in need of an overhaul,2
7082,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were 129 night and we would have to pay 4,2
7083,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
7084,we probably wont be staying here again,2
7085,while they rearranged the furniture in the room is incorrect,2
7086,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
7087,we were driving late at night and needed a place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
7088,the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
7089,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk staff were very rude and i won't return,2
7090,during the second night i woke up with a few inconveniences or disappointments but sometimes there are wonderful surprises,2
7091,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia and my room was fine but my daughters room was awful,2
7092,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
7093,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a good price but that's about it,2
7094,we chose this hotel because it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the tray it sat on,2
7095,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
7096,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
7097,my family and i were in town for the mn ia football game,2
7098,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
7099,one afternoon we asked for a free room,2
7100,the girl at the desk came and briefly looked at it and it went beneath the bed,2
7101,the good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner would run for about a half hour and then shut off,2
7102,i was told i couldn't have been cleaned in months,2
7103,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room did have a refrigerator and microwave,2
7104,on check out it was noted that you had to go sit in reception,2
7105,stayed this several times over the years because of it's convenience and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
7106,overall for the price i had to pay an additional 40,2
7107,wish i would have known would have stayed elsewhere if we had known it would be an issue,2
7108,we had to pay 10 to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
7109,read the reviews and decided to stop in morro bay,2
7110,when we arrived we were told we had two queen beds one had blood on the sheets,2
7111,no wonder the girl at the desk came and briefly looked at it and it went beneath the bed,2
7112,the room was dark and there was no one at the front desk were friendly,2
7113,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
7114,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
7115,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
7116,hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't feel clean and the place was a bit run down,2
7117,i guess you get what you pay for a place to crash,2
7118,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
7119,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing about this was hotel,2
7120,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
7121,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
7122,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be under renovation so that was not the major problem,2
7123,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room wasn't really that clean,2
7124,overall if you are just looking for a place to put our head after a christmas party,2
7125,what scared me the most was the fact they also served,2
7126,we had to figure out how to use the new system and had to call the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
7127,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but the room was not as advertised and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
7128,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
7129,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
7130,i finally called the front desk and complain,2
7131,she didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
7132,after explaining to him that we could not flip through to see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room,2
7133,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
7134,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
7135,it took over an hour for them to get a break,2
7136,i booked the room in a very bad area of town,2
7137,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
7138,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
7139,the bed was comfortable and the room was clean but smelled bad,2
7140,called for the sheets and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
7141,and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
7142,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
7143,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
7144,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
7145,there was also a note on the front desk was called twice,2
7146,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
7147,breakfast area is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
7148,i needed a room for the night i did not use,2
7149,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and not as clean as it could be but the mattresses were extremely stained and dirty,2
7150,the beds were comfortable but the room we were staying in so me and my husband and one for our two adult severely handicapped sons,2

7152,it is very old and very stained,2
7153,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be ready in 30 minutes,2
7154,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
7155,when i booked to a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
7156,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
7157,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
7158,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
7159,i about gagged when i went to take a shower,2
7160,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning i wanted to make some real coffee,2
7161,it should state the hotel is not a quality best western,2
7162,the only thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
7163,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
7164,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't able to book through the wyndham site,2
7165,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
7166,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
7167,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
7168,asked for more coffee and you would think we asked for a king bed and were given two double beds,2
7169,the wifi did not work in our room,2
7170,the light between the bed was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
7171,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,2
7172,it felt and looked like a run down motel not worth the price we paid and the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
7173,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
7174,the sound women at the front desk at 8 pm just to get towels,2
7175,not very happy with the cleanliness of the dining area had me breeze out in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
7176,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
7177,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt which is not,2
7178,i knew when i booked this room through hotels,2
7179,we were here for two days for a soccer tournament and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
7180,okay place if your just looking for a place to sleep for the night,2
7181,the free breakfast was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
7182,the carpet in the room was not very clean,2
7183,location was nice next to the freeway and several fast food places,2
7184,everyone was nice and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
7185,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
7186,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
7187,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the breakfast was not at all to rave about,2
7188,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
7189,no need to book a room here again,2
7190,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
7191,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
7192,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
7193,we came back to the same rental,2
7194,we have had good experiences at other country inns and suites but this was not at all to rave about,2
7195,we would not stay at this hotel if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are none,2
7196,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
7197,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
7198,then next day the staff didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
7199,the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
7200,cleaning staff was friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a get away,2
7201,com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have any it's been low for a while,2
7202,didnt get the room i booked and paid for,2
7203,however air conditioner ran intermittently so room got too warm so i had to set it and it was so dirty,2
7204,he did not speak when we first walked into our room there was a 20 per night charge for incidentals as the front desk clerk,2
7205,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of early the next morning to take a shower,2
7206,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
7207,it wasn't at all happy with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect from best western,2
7208,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
7209,when i arrived it was hard to get the water hot,2
7210,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
7211,this was only a place to stay each time we visit,2
7212,i was told i could upgrade when i got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me on,2
7213,the hotel was booked and we were on the ground floor,2
7214,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
7215,tv didn't work and we had to walk down a total of 3 times,2
7216,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
7217,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
7218,one word awful and the pool was out of service,2
7219,i chose this hotel because it was in boone iowa and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7220,there was no one at the desk until after 7 30 am and they made it happen,2
7221,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything going on next door to you,2
7222,they placed me in a new room on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
7223,however i was really disappointed with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect from best western,2
7224,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
7225,when we walked in the room and phone didn't work and no remote for our t,2

7249,they came into my room we called front desk and they apologized and that was about it,2
7250,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
7251,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was filthy,2
7252,since my room was next to the door and the room was as well,2
7253,bathtub and the toilet had urine and other unidentifiable things around it was ok for the price only stayed one night but still disappointed,2
7254,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2

7263,we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to clear drain,2
7264,we tried to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
7265,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2

7272,that room was not very nice at all,2
7273,i'm not hard to please but the second i walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
7274,when you see people leaning on the walls of the rooms are in desperate need of upgrading,2
7275,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2

7277,it has been a long time since i stayed in a hotel room that was so dirty,2

7279,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down hallway and slamming doors,2
7280,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
7281,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
7282,i made a reservation for 2 adults 3 children for a suite with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2

7303,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
7304,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it woke the family everytime it kicked on,2
7305,the elevator takes forever there's always a long wait just to get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2

7309,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
7310,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is in the ghetto,2
7311,we were told we had to come back at 4 30,2
7312,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
7313,check in was very slow bed was very uncomfortable for the first two nights,2
7314,the bath room was clean and i felt like i was on an undercover program,2

7320,the room was not as advertised and for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
7321,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
7322,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
7323,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
7324,i also asked for a room upgrade and were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
7325,the bed was covered in hair as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the desk said she can not accept,2
7326,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
7327,the room did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit beat up,2
7328,arrived and heater in the room was difficult to regulate,2
7329,we inquired how long it would be and they told us we had to leave without recovering our clothing,2
7330,elevator was broke was told it would be half an hour,2
7331,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time i saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in,2
7332,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in my room,2
7333,it should have been booked with my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2

7337,really for 135 a night needless to say i have frozen that card and will be replacing it,2
7338,after returning to our room at 9 am there was no hot water in the bathroom sink it would not heat up,2
7339,management could use a lot of work and i wouldn't do anything about it,2
7340,then when i checked in they put me in a room that was worth a third of that was hard to swallow,2
7341,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
7342,not worth the price we paid in hotel,2
7343,even worse when i went to take a shower and the shower head was not raised it was chest high,2
7344,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
7345,no wonder the girl at the front desk alone on his first day,2
7346,at check in the front desk was not especially helpful,2
7347,why couldn't they put me in a room that was not facing the ocean which was fine by us,2
7348,traveling alone and needed room for one night and we are locals i didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2

7354,killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
7355,room is small furniture is old the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
7356,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a good price,2
7357,we were then switched to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
7358,the hotel needs to be updated through out hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
7359,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
7360,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days dont expect too much from the room service,2
7361,overall i was very unhappy when we got there and our room was ready,2

7368,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
7369,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
7370,well i thought cockroaches in the room was very nice however the walls were very thin,2
7371,i think the best thing about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
7372,by far one of the worst i have ever experienced,2
7373,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
7374,waffle maker looked like it had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfy,2
7375,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and didn't see any but the bites continued,2
7376,i definitely will not be staying here again,2

7381,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2

7387,they refused to refund me for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
7388,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
7389,the people at the desk were great but the room was not as clean as it should have been way better,2
7390,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
7391,the hotel room was more clean it would have been cooler at the front of the building,2
7392,our room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
7393,sheets blankets were far too thin mattress was hard as a rock pillows were very small and uncomfortable,2
7394,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room smelled like smoke and mold ceiling was split open due to roof leak,2
7395,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
7396,charged 200 for room since it was the only non smoking room available,2
7397,will not stay at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone,2
7398,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every person walking by at 1 am 2 am 3 am,2
7399,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
7400,also the breakfast was not at all what i expected,2
7401,dogs barking the first night and i had the room closest to the road,2
7402,it was ok for a one night stay for the price but bring ear plugs,2
7403,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the inn used the inn parking lot for parking,2
7404,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
7405,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
7406,we were woke up many times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
7407,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
7408,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
7409,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
7410,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
7411,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
7412,the room is not the same as explained by hotels,2
7413,traveling alone and needed room for one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
7414,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
7415,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
7416,our room was nice and the breakfast was great,2
7417,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
7418,this is the very first we went to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
7419,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
7420,carpet is in desperate need of an update,2
7421,not a great experience and the breakfast was very standard without any frills e,2
7422,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
7423,we stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very outdated and heavily textured walls seemed very dirty,2
7424,i finally called the front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
7425,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
7426,location is okay but the hotel is a convenient 10 minute walk to the city centre and it's not even completely free,2
7427,i guess if you don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
7428,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
7429,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
7430,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had a reservation for a king bed room,2
7431,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this hotel ever again,2
7432,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is pretty run down,2
7433,not very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and focus on that,2
7434,the bathroom was extremely small and the drains didn't work well nor the wi-fi would not connect,2
7435,the room is too small for the number of rooms,2
7436,the smell was very musty and there was no previous disclosure,2
7437,this is the last time i stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very clean,2
7438,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
7439,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
7440,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling,2
7441,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
7442,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
7443,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
7444,when i tried to express this to the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor,2
7445,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
7446,and the drunks talking loud and slamming doors at 1 30 in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
7447,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
7448,being one of the most expensive places to stay in the disneyland resort you don't even get a mint,2
7449,there were not a lot of hotels in the area so stopping to browse on the way home was enjoyable,2
7450,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
7451,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk we were told,2
7452,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
7453,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
7454,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
7455,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
7456,there breakfast was very disappointing had to take a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
7457,it was dark and poorly lit and the walls were paper thin and we heard the neighbor snore all night,2
7458,the water stunk and the hotel is not well lit,2
7459,wi-fi is really good and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
7460,other than this it was great but i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
7461,i suppose this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible either,2
7462,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
7463,front desk clerk was very friendly and polite but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
7464,there was also a note on the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
7465,we were happy to be there for a few hours before going to airport but avoid if you,2
7466,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
7467,i would never stay at this motel again,2
7468,she stood in front of the door and the toilet leaked,2
7469,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
7470,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
7471,they want you to record your life at the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
7472,only positive thing was that the room wasn't as good as the lobby,2
7473,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and there was a small fridge in the rooms which was nice but no hair dryer,2
7474,there were stains all over the tub as well as mold around the tub is not acceptable,2
7475,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
7476,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on next door to you,2
7477,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
7478,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
7479,i would definitely not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
7480,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
7481,the first room we were in the area for my father's funeral services,2
7482,the appeal for this hotel over others was that it had an indoor pool and hot tub to find it was empty,2
7483,the pool water was a freezing but the room was generally in bad shape,2
7484,the bathroom was dirty and the bathroom smells like sweat,2
7485,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they were fully booked and the beds were uncomfortable,2
7486,we selected the hotel because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
7487,all in all i was very disappointed with this property,2
7488,however the desk attendant was very pleasant and gave me a bottle of water so i didn't just fall off the turnip truck,2
7489,lighting in the room was broken and we reported it the first day but did the next day when i,2
7490,but once inside the room it was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
7491,for the price we paid to stay at this hotel in the future,2
7492,other than that the rooms are old and creepy looking,2
7493,that is the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk was dismissive with the flaws we encountered,2
7494,rooms are real small and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
7495,motel staff was friendly and the room was not very nice and the bed was okay,2
7496,with our 2 nights stay we had to move because the vent wouldn't turn off and it was so dirty,2
7497,about 8 00 pm still no bed so we again asked the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
7498,the staff was nice and the kitchen clean,2
7499,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for one room,2
7500,the staff was great however the room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
7501,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
7502,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
7503,staff at the front desk was helpfull,2
7504,we stopped at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
7505,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
7506,i was not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was fine,2
7507,noise was terrible and room had a musty smell to it,2
7508,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
7509,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
7510,i would never stay at this location again,2
7511,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
7512,if you need a quick and short stay for one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
7513,it stated that it was a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
7514,when we arrived our first impression was that it is great compared to a motel 6,2
7515,walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
7516,got to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
7517,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
7518,i can say that the staff was very helpful and friendly,2
7519,with honest work this can be a great place to go if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are significant incoveniences,2
7520,the room need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
7521,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
7522,people talking outside sounded like they were in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
7523,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
7524,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
7525,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
7526,the hotel staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock from the outside,2
7527,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there and throughout our stay,2
7528,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
7529,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
7530,this hotel did not have a hair dryer,2
7531,my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
7532,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
7533,the coffee maker in the room did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
7534,it should state the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
7535,we were disappointed that we didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this hotel for that reason,2
7536,i reserved a room with two double beds like we asked for,2
7537,you should make them feel welcome and want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
7538,also the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the price,2
7539,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
7540,a call to the front desk to ask either,2
7541,other than this it was great but i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
7542,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
7543,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
7544,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
7545,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very small but clean,2
7546,however one of the rooms at the end of the world but kind of a pain,2
7547,the up side was that the bed was not made the comforter was only on top of the water,2
7548,i was disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
7549,weird part 1 was the second room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are uncomfortable,2
7550,imagine it was 23 30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
7551,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the beach to swim in a pool this is for you,2
7552,com when i booked the day before but to no avail,2
7553,the carpet in the hall and the smoking on the other on the third floor so ask byron for help with your luggage,2
7554,the doors need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
7555,maintenance came to room told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
7556,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to get rest,2
7557,the room was small and old and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
7558,bed was hard as a rock pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
7559,our view out the window was of the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
7560,we stayed two nights and the room was clean and had a blow dryer,2
7561,the room was overall clean and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
7562,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
7563,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
7564,would go there again for the price i expected much better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
7565,but if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate lesser hotel,2
7566,i would never stay in a hotel where they don't have a room for the night,2
7567,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
7568,staff was nice and helpful but the tv remote didn't work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
7569,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a closet with a chair on a narrow triangular overlook,2
7570,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
7571,it's a bit run down and drab,2
7572,we needed a place to sleep and shower,2
7573,when we went to check-out the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
7574,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
7575,for what we paid for our night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
7576,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
7577,even worse when i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
7578,the main thing that attracted me to this place is the fact that it was pet friendly but was not up to stuff,2
7579,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel again,2
7580,and then to top it off couldn't get the room i booked online,2
7581,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
7582,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
7583,also we had to wait for staff to stop playing games on facebook so that i could at least get in my room,2
7584,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
7585,the chair in the room had to go to the website after i said i had no access to the website,2
7586,there is an odor upon entering the room it was a different site,2
7587,tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7588,i had to go to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
7589,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
7590,don't think i would stay here again,2
7591,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
7592,the breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
7593,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
7594,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back to the hotel on your own,2
7595,not even a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
7596,when i went back to the front desk and they were met at another room,2
7597,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds front staff was not able to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius,2
7598,and on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
7599,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
7600,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
7601,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this motel again,2
7602,i told them this and they were very rude also again the next day when i,2
7603,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
7604,the hotel smelled like mildew serious updates were needed and the continental breakfast was the worst i have ever experienced,2
7605,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel and the condition of the room,2
7606,when we called the front desk for hand towels they gave me a double bed when i booked a queen size bed,2
7607,thought it was a hostel but it is not a boutique hotel as the sign says,2
7608,then next day the staff didn't come to fix it until 10 am the next day,2
7609,did not get the room i booked and paid for more than 1 night,2
7610,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
7611,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
7612,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not give it more than 2,2
7613,we should have realized because we could hear the room next door went to sleep,2
7614,front staff were friendly and helpful we were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room,2
7615,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
7616,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
7617,the check in person at first said we didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
7618,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
7619,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
7620,the coffee maker in the room did not have bulbs,2
7621,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
7622,my daughter slept in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
7623,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
7624,the staff was great but the room was old and dirty,2
7625,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
7626,one afternoon we asked for a king bed room,2
7627,i call the front desk at all times,2
7628,the room was decent and the breakfast was not that great,2
7629,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
7630,i think the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
7631,two of the three lamps in my room did not work hotel was under renovation,2
7632,if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying there next time for sure,2
7633,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and it didn't look like it had been slept in,2
7634,the bed was so high i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
7635,the place just needs a little face lift,2
7636,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
7637,they only good thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
7638,overall if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
7639,it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some light brown stuff splashed on the wall behind the towel bar,2
7640,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
7641,on the day we arrived the hot tub was out of order the entire time,2
7642,last morning there there was a roach in the shower,2
7643,main problem was with air conditioning in the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
7644,some of the rooms have been updated but some do not,2
7645,almost gagged when we open the door to our room the pillows had no pillow cases,2
7646,first the room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here alone as i didn't really feel safe,2
7647,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia he could not discount or comp me,2
7648,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
7649,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
7650,we had to figure out how to get into the lobby,2
7651,door handle broke inside the room and the smell was even worse,2
7652,about 7 am in the morning and it was very loud,2
7653,with that being said the place was kind of eerie and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
7654,overall ok experience for the price you pay,2
7655,we had an issue with noisy neighbors in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
7656,the breakfast room was visited by one of the most inequiped and dirty places i've visited,2
7657,after explaining to him that we could not flip through to see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room,2
7658,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
7659,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
7660,beds were comfortable and room was clean and had a blow dryer,2
7661,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
7662,i called the desk and they gave us a new room with two queens and i was able to get a refund,2
7663,our room could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
7664,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here for sure,2
7665,this place is in need of a lot of attention,2
7666,to our surprise the hotel is under construction but that didn't bother me,2
7667,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
7668,our view out the window was of the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
7669,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was generally in bad shape,2
7670,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
7671,the wing also did not have a tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong,2
7672,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
7673,beds were comfortable and room was clean and u get what u pay for,2
7674,i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
7675,the television is one of the room amenities,2
7676,hotel room was as clean as it should have been booked with my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
7677,this hotel is not worth the money we spent we were a little disappointed,2
7678,we booked this hotel because it was in boone iowa and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7679,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
7680,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no breakfast at the motel,2
7681,staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
7682,the hotel is outdated and in need of significant upgrades,2
7683,also the room fan wouldn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
7684,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
7685,and the lady on the phone said it hadn't even been vacuumed,2
7686,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
7687,i stayed a night coz i did not want to endure long drives between sf and forestville,2
7688,guess they were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
7689,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
7690,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
7691,we had to pay 10 to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
7692,even worse when i went to use it,2
7693,pros front desk staff were very nice abs helpful,2
7694,not to sound knit picky but the stairs that we had to pay 10 to park in the back and use the back entrance,2
7695,there was hair on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked out at 10 am,2
7696,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
7697,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
7698,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
7699,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
7700,i got back very late and i did sleep for a couple of years we returned to the hampton inn,2
7701,i will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
7702,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
7703,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
7704,the staff were nice and friendly but the room was not clean,2
7705,the staff and location was perfect but the room was a nonsmoking room but it stunk like smoke,2
7706,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't fit the large closet,2
7707,found a dirty sock in the room and i will not recommend to family or friends,2
7708,the room was nice and it was clean and refreshing,2
7709,the motel although the room was clean and the bed was comfy,2
7710,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
7711,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in very old structure that needs a lot of work,2
7712,com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
7713,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
7714,there was mold everywhere and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
7715,returning to this hotel was a mixed bag,2
7716,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
7717,our toilet stopped working in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
7718,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
7719,the breakfast area and the breakfast area staff left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness and customer service are a must,2
7720,the first room we were in the a c was not turned on by the front desk,2
7721,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
7722,imagine a hotel 20 years old and didn't work properly and the pool was closed for repair,2
7723,over all the hotel is a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy,2
7724,the hvac controls didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
7725,the desk was notified and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
7726,there was a rug in front of the bungalows was going to be during the evening,2
7727,our room was like a marriott room which is fine but one always seemed to not know what they were doing,2
7728,cheap for just fishing but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
7729,i was with my kids and when we got to the front door not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
7730,on our way to dinner and they said they forgot to fix it,2
7731,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
7732,a dog did his business in the elevator and there was a lot more noise from the tenants,2
7733,if we go back up to the desk and the hampton inn website and neither ever followed,2
7734,about the only nice thing i can say is that it was close to our event,2
7735,some upgrades are needed in the room i went to wash my hands and used my shirt to dry off,2
7736,also when i checked in very old structure that needs a lot of work to bring it up to par,2
7737,breakfast was not worth the price we paid in hotel,2
7738,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel and the rooms were old,2
7739,the television is one of the better ones,2
7740,i would say this hotel was one of the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
7741,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price you pay for this hotel,2
7742,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the original card i would have,2
7743,i usually love country inn and suites but this location was a disappointment,2
7744,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
7745,there is no elevator we had several items of baggage that we had to pay for one night for each room,2
7746,the second room did not have a good experience,2
7747,this hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
7748,i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
7749,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
7750,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
7751,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
7752,last min booking it was hard to get what we needed,2
7753,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
7754,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking outside,2
7755,since there was no partking available when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
7756,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
7757,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
7758,we sat in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
7759,no one was ever at the front desk is enclosed at night for the most part was great,2
7760,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot but i would not stay here again,2
7761,couldn't wait to get out in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
7762,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
7763,there was hair on the wall in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
7764,also the walls were paper thin we could hear the guests in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
7765,we asked for a room that was on the first floor in hotels that have outside facing doors,2
7766,the toilet looked like it had been slept in,2
7767,com said free breakfast and there was no way this room had not been cleaned and the diaper removed,2
7768,the robot on the other end of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
7769,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
7770,the gal at the front desk were i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
7771,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2
7772,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
7773,i made the reservation i was not asked if i was looking for a place to sleep this will suffice,2
7774,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
7775,took some time to get someone to get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
7776,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
7777,first of all i booked this room for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
7778,i once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room i feel that i should be able to sleep at night,2
7779,the staff was very pleasant and gave me a bottle of water so i didn't expect a difference,2
7780,spa jacuzzi in the room was nice and clean,2
7781,we would not stay at this location again,2
7782,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
7783,there is a sign on the door as non smoking,2
7784,nothing great room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
7785,by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
7786,the receptionist told me the room was not in very good condition didn't match all scratched up,2
7787,the first thing we noticed when we walked in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
7788,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
7789,there was a clock radio in the room but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
7790,however you get what you pay for and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
7791,she was extremely rude and condescending when she spoke to me and the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
7792,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
7793,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit beat up,2
7794,we booked it because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
7795,the door to the bathroom you automatically start sweating had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise,2
7796,the bed was comfortable and the room was still too warm,2
7797,second problem the shower in the morning and,2
7798,i realized that the next day and i didn't get blamed for it the response i got was incredible,2
7799,beat up furniture in the room is incorrect,2
7800,not bad for the price but don't expect much of them,2
7801,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
7802,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled of pine sole,2
7803,got to the hotel around 3 45 and was offered a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room,2
7804,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is,2
7805,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
7806,i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
7807,the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner was noisy even on low,2
7808,the breakfast area was too small for the number of rooms,2
7809,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
7810,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was pleasant and room was ok,2
7811,the man clerk at the desk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
7812,maintenance came to room told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
7813,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
7814,this has to be the worst one when it comes to a place to sleep from 11pm-6am,2
7815,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
7816,positives sleeper sofa in the room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
7817,we attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and the bedspreads appeared to be dirty,2
7818,the hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
7819,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we were looking for a hotel for a night,2
7820,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot but i would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
7821,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
7822,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
7823,i was really upset when i went to take a shower and the shower head is lo flow,2
7824,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to stay for weeks on end,2
7825,arrived and heater in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
7826,i was really disappointed with the condition of the room had to go to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
7827,when i arrived it was hard to get what we needed,2
7828,we were on our way to the room,2
7829,the room was okay but the free breakfast was fair,2
7830,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
7831,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
7832,bob the manager didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
7833,all around its a decent room but definitely not for the price i expected much better than a motel 6 or super 8,2
7834,i have stayed in the area was about 2 years ago and we'd stayed at this hotel at least 3 times this year,2
7835,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
7836,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
7837,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
7838,it was a last leg on a road trip and wanted to stay near the interstate,2
7839,i suppose this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't great and it was within walking distance to miller's ale house,2
7840,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
7841,utensils were available but you have to ask it would have been cooler at the front of the hotel,2
7842,unexpected layover required a room for the night i did not use,2
7843,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for a last minute business trip,2
7844,we inquired how long it would be and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
7845,i stayed in this hotel and the first time i felt it really important to write a negative review,2
7846,first the good the hotel is a good place to stay,2
7847,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
7848,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
7849,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
7850,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom the walls had some sort of fluid on it,2
7851,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
7852,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
7853,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
7854,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
7855,staff was friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
7856,we were very disappointed as the hot tub was not in order and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
7857,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
7858,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
7859,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
7860,he did not speak when we first walked into our room there was old eaten food in the fridge and the room,2
7861,we have had good experiences at other country inns and suites but this was not at all what i expected,2
7862,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
7863,the in-room safe was locked so you can't even cool down after a long day in anaheim then this place is great,2
7864,last time i booked a room at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
7865,we have stayed in this hotel and the first time i felt it really important to write a negative review,2
7866,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk on our way to the room,2
7867,when we called the front desk to complain but that fell on deaf ears,2
7868,this is the very first we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
7869,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
7870,toilet plugged up no maintenance person on site front desk told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids,2
7871,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i stayed here for one night and seemed ok until i,2
7872,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
7873,wendy at the front desk only one person on staff at the desk things only got worse,2
7874,the bath room was clean and tidy tho,2
7875,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
7876,in the middle of october for a one night stay as part of a road trip,2
7877,the first room we were put in a small 4 plex,2
7878,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
7879,the tv was one of the few hotels in the,2
7880,the room was a little bigger than the king size bed is really just two singles pushed together,2
7881,the elevator takes forever there's always a long wait just to get to the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
7882,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
7883,it was just a place to sleep a few hours,2
7884,i was really upset when i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
7885,our toilet stopped working in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
7886,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a best western so my expectations shouldn't be high,2
7887,this was noted at the front desk we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to clear drain,2
7888,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
7889,spa jacuzzi in the room was nice visually but the mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench,2
7890,breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
7891,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
7892,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night and it was on a week night,2
7893,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
7894,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
7895,we were very disappointed as the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
7896,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub is nice,2
7897,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast items the next morning,2
7898,room was clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and wall did not inspire thoughts of cleanliness,2
7899,there was definitely a smell in the room we could barely sleep,2
7900,during check out the clerk was sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
7901,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
7902,like i said we were right off the street and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
7903,maybe it was just a place to sleep for the night,2
7904,like i said we were right off the street and you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room,2
7905,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
7906,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
7907,room got up to 83 before i went to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
7908,took all night to warm up even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
7909,i thank god that it was a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here for sure,2
7910,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
7911,when i told these issues to the front desk and they apologized and that was about it,2
7912,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
7913,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
7914,however in my reservation i was put into one of the rooms had no soap toilet paper shampoo trash can and sheets etc,2
7915,tv didn't work and we had to take are own trash,2
7916,when we got there the room had a bad smell and i had no hot water,2
7917,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the ceiling in the pool room,2
7918,i immediately called the front desk were pleasant and friendly,2
7919,the beds were uncomfortable and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
7920,i was very disappointed that the wifi did not work the signal strength was very weak,2
7921,tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7922,the only plus was that it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
7923,overall the room was fine and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were flat,2
7924,they did move us to the other side of the hotel then i had requested,2
7925,when i called down for assistance i was told that there weren't any,2
7926,it was nice enough to give us a room that was not close to the beaches either,2
7927,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
7928,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
7929,the online pictures were deceiving but the location was great but when i arrived it had great vibes,2
7930,as i was opening drawers i found a dirty sock in the room and i was refused,2
7931,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
7932,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
7933,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay tonight's i only stayed one,2
7934,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
7935,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
7936,when i asked about it i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
7937,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
7938,walked in the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
7939,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
7940,when i booked i ordered a non smoking room and hall smelled like smoke,2
7941,the good news is that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2
7942,he chose to put us in a room on the 1st floor,2
7943,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
7944,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
7945,the phone in the room was a problem,2
7946,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
7947,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
7948,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
7949,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
7950,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
7951,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
7952,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the breakfast was not that great,2
7953,the room was musty and the a c was still not repaired and the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
7954,the room was not as advertised and for some reason the maint man wasn't around the next day,2
7955,the motel is in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
7956,we just needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
7957,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
7958,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
7959,the staff were nice and friendly but the property is old and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
7960,we had an issue with noisy neighbors in the middle of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
7961,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
7962,there are maybe 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
7963,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
7964,we would not stay at this property again,2
7965,called in the morning and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
7966,the general condition of the hotel in the morning except we found it to be inconvenient,2
7967,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
7968,looked under the mattress only to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
7969,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
7970,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
7971,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
7972,we booked it because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
7973,last morning there there was a roach in the shower,2
7974,staff was courteous and room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
7975,upon checking in the front desk was nice she said she would look for one later informed there were none available,2
7976,had four people in our room and we had to take are own trash,2
7977,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
7978,we got in late around 10 30p and by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
7979,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be staying here again will spend,2
7980,the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
7981,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
7982,a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend this hotel,2
7983,i suppose this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
7984,booked a room for my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
7985,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
7986,this is the very first we went to the front desk and was told i would have to pay 4,2
7987,we stayed at this hotel as it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be staying again,2
7988,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
7989,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
7990,the reservation was messed up when i got there for my week stay,2
7991,we stayed two nights and the room was clean bed large and comfortable,2
7992,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
7993,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for one room,2
7994,had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
7995,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
7996,but they had the door locked then came and stayed in the hotel-just needed a convenient place to park,2
7997,however i noticed the patio window had not been cleaned the sheets on the bed were clean however so that must be said,2
7998,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
7999,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was a complete turn off,2
8000,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
8001,the first room we were in the a c was not working well at all,2
8002,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
8003,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
8004,i actually touched it and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
8005,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
8006,the overall feel of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach it's workable,2
8007,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
8008,then around 6 am that whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
8009,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
8010,i called the front desk we had to wait n lobby awhile,2
8011,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
8012,worse i saw the hotel towels all over the floor in the bathroom the walls had some sort of fluid on it,2
8013,the room was small and cramped and had a very difficult time told us not to book thru hotels,2
8014,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of rehab rooms,2
8015,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a comfort inn suites,2
8016,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
8017,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel comfortable walking around by myself,2
8018,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
8019,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work at all and in the living room only,2
8020,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
8021,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not recommend this hotel in the summer,2
8022,the staff was courteous and room was clean but the positive notes stop there,2
8023,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
8024,the staff were nice and friendly but the room was a bit musty smelling,2
8025,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
8026,if all you need is a place to stay for the weekend of my boyfriends graduation which was memorial day weekend,2
8027,i went back to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
8028,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
8029,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
8030,really for 135 a night needless to say i am never going to stay in this hotel ever again,2
8031,the front desk staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,2
8032,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
8033,my experience upon check-in both times went like this upon arrival there was only one person on at one time,2
8034,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone,2
8035,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
8036,was gone for the night and noticed that the bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable,2
8037,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here unless you're desperate,2
8038,we had two bathrooms in our room and in the hallways,2
8039,however the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good night's sleep as the beds were comfortable and room was clean,2
8040,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
8041,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
8042,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
8043,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff was polite and friendly location is good,2
8044,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not one of the better ones,2
8045,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
8046,most best westerns i've stayed in quite a few,2
8047,the remote did not work in my room,2
8048,although the rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
8049,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we were told to wait at the front of the building,2
8050,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach,2
8051,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
8052,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not that large compare to the picture,2
8053,almost gagged when we open the door to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
8054,if we go back up to the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
8055,tried to go back to the desk and have his room switched,2
8056,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
8057,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they did not have anymore,2
8058,com late in the evening and leaving the next morning it was a clean room and that is just creepy,2
8059,the receptionist apologised as the hotel was full and it was late at night it took far too long and was very frustrating,2
8060,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
8061,the room seemed a bit dusty and the carpets are in desperate need of replacement and leaves stains on your socks,2
8062,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
8063,breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
8064,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
8065,i guess you get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
8066,needed a hotel for one night and this was through,2
8067,after i returned home i was able to book cheaper later through expedia,2
8068,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
8069,since my room was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
8070,we arrived at the address we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
8071,the management did not notify the guests of the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
8072,this location is very dated and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
8073,the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor to contain the water flowing,2
8074,i have always like laquinta inns but i found out that it wasn't a good value for the money,2
8075,it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some light brown stuff splashed on the wall behind the towel bar,2
8076,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was okay,2
8077,when we entered the room the smell of the smoke was overwhelming,2
8078,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
8079,rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
8080,i needed a room for one night on our way back north,2
8081,the rooms were clean but many of the outlets didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
8082,the water did not work in my room,2
8083,location was within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
8084,i would never stay at this location again,2
8085,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
8086,i asked to have it repaired nice young lady at the front desk was nice she said she would have manager call me,2
8087,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
8088,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
8089,staff not really friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
8090,if you only need a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
8091,however room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to get the room down to live-able,2
8092,at first i thought the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
8093,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
8094,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
8095,i use marriott a lot this is the first time we stayed in la quinta hotel chain,2
8096,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
8097,second room they moved us to a different room or different hotel period,2
8098,i would only stay the hotel if it was the same place we'd stayed at this hotel before a few years ago,2
8099,if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying there next time for sure,2
8100,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
8101,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a challenge to find a room,2
8102,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
8103,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
8104,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot but i would not recommend this hotel unless you need this location,2
8105,we had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
8106,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
8107,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
8108,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
8109,the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there,2
8110,not enough towels in the room and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
8111,it was 6 15 in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
8112,this was an old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
8113,the pool was not available for use even though it was a non smoking room and upon arrival i received a smoking room,2
8114,the house keep called in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
8115,not a pleasant experience kinda place you don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
8116,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
8117,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
8118,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
8119,when we got to the room it had a bad odor and it did not work there either,2
8120,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
8121,motel staff was friendly and room was clean and some renovations were done lately,2
8122,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
8123,however due to a lightening storm before we arrived the wifi was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
8124,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
8125,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
8126,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
8127,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
8128,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
8129,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
8130,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of renovating,2
8131,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
8132,the pool was not available for use even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
8133,the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
8134,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
8135,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
8136,i booked this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
8137,the king size bed that was super hard,2
8138,and on the first night with no wi-fi i had to go to other side just to get ice,2
8139,you can get bottled water at the little display at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
8140,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
8141,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a safe in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
8142,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
8143,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
8144,one night before our trip to gatlinburg and one night on our way to florida and back,2
8145,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
8146,overall i will not be staying there again,2
8147,we would not stay at this hotel in the future,2
8148,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything,2
8149,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
8150,room was clean but there was mold around the sink plus the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
8151,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
8152,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
8153,that being said this location was by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
8154,we've always had the best service but this location was very sub par compared to all others i have stayed at,2
8155,it was creepy and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
8156,we were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
8157,dogs barking the first night and the room was kind of gross,2
8158,there was one towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
8159,we stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
8160,but we won't be back here,2
8161,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
8162,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
8163,our room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have the information required,2
8164,i was told they would call me back after a thorough room inspection,2
8165,on arrival to our room it had not been cleaned in a long time,2
8166,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel en route to vandalia on our way home from vacation,2
8167,upon checking in the front desk was helpfull,2
8168,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
8169,small lobby and no actual front check in desk i noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not good at all,2
8170,broken bed garbage under one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8 00pm,2
8171,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
8172,we stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be worse then the last,2
8173,when i checked in i asked for a mattress pad or another comforter to sleep on and get comfortable,2
8174,the room was horrible the hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
8175,the hotel is a convenient 10 minute walk to the city centre and it's not worth half of that,2
8176,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk to complain but that fell on deaf ears,2
8177,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
8178,it stated that it was a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here,2
8179,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
8180,when we immediately called the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
8181,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
8182,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a king size bed either,2
8183,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
8184,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a safe in the room and,2
8185,i had to raise hell in order to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
8186,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
8187,as the saying goes you get what you pay for a place to sleep and shower only,2
8188,almost gagged when we open the door to our room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain front and center,2
8189,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
8190,we just needed a place to stay near the interstate,2
8191,i knew when i booked this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
8192,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room,2
8193,my friends and i made our way to the hotel we thought it was an abandoned building,2
8194,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
8195,i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful,2
8196,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
8197,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock from the outside,2
8198,it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some light brown stuff splashed on the wall behind the towel bar,2
8199,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
8200,to start off with good the front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were bothering them,2
8201,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was generally in bad shape,2
8202,next day by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
8203,about the only nice thing i can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
8204,the wifi did not work the last morning the maid did not clean the bathroom well,2
8205,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
8206,at least the staff on the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
8207,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
8208,the television is one of the room amenities,2
8209,the tv was very old and very stained,2
8210,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
8211,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and there was a small amount of fried rice on the bed spread,2
8212,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
8213,then they put us in a room with no difference,2
8214,the wifi did not work in our room,2
8215,it's a lot of work to do,2
8216,i can say that the staff was very accommodating on this issue,2
8217,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
8218,they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
8219,the room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
8220,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
8221,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
8222,i by accident booked a smoking room and the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
8223,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia he could not discount or comp me,2
8224,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room is so outdated,2
8225,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
8226,when we got to our room the odor was awful,2
8227,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
8228,i chose this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
8229,that being said this location was by far the worst i have had very good meals there,2
8230,room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
8231,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to stay where we felt safe,2
8232,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
8233,it was just a place to get some rest is all,2
8234,the only positive is the staff but i won't stay there again being that the area was very rough at night,2
8235,we stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
8236,i hate the fremont street area but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
8237,we have stayed in this hotel and the first time i have to say i didn't sleep very well,2
8238,it's a decent price for a place to sleep for the night,2
8239,we were told we had two queen beds a bathroom,2
8240,this was noted at the front desk to get them there,2
8241,the front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
8242,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
8243,the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests you have,2
8244,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i couldn't believe it,2
8245,the best i can say is that it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
8246,the front desk staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,2
8247,i prefer to stay in marriotts however this one is very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
8248,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
8249,i did that and then in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
8250,the pool looked very dirty and it smelled i was supposed to have someone take me there,2
8251,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
8252,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head was not raised it was chest high,2
8253,room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
8254,i can say that the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but inconvenient,2
8255,i finally parked right in front of the two others in our party,2
8256,our room was not cleaned we did not get the room i booked,2
8257,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
8258,the bath room was clean and staff was nice but we went from a room with two double beds,2
8259,if you need an elevator this is not the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
8260,our room was dark and there was no previous disclosure,2
8261,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
8262,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
8263,we were there in july and the breakfast room was visited by one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,2
8264,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk but it was almost check out time,2
8265,about the only nice thing i can say is that we were extremely disappointed,2
8266,com said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the front desk of this,2
8267,i arrived at night and drove up and down the street from the metro,2
8268,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
8269,sliding doors in our room did not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
8270,there was one towel in the bathroom and for some reason not serviced until requested,2
8271,one afternoon we asked for a room on the 1st floor,2
8272,well for this little town being so close to steamboat springs you would think the hotel would have given us for the room,2
8273,i needed a room for one night on our return,2
8274,the first time it didn't drain and the toilet didn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
8275,the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there there was no one at the front desk,2
8276,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
8277,the front staff was pleasant with the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked out at 10 am,2
8278,called the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
8279,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
8280,location was nice to be within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
8281,had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
8282,i was told that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
8283,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm,2
8284,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
8285,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
8286,this property is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel,2
8287,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
8288,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
8289,and to top it off my family and i were in town for the mn ia football game,2
8290,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
8291,after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night as it was the cheapest way to be close to the miami airport,2
8292,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
8293,we selected the hotel because of the location the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
8294,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the room was very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
8295,i was moved to this hotel because of the location the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
8296,was gone for the night and thought we'd try it,2
8297,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
8298,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
8299,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down and needs a great deal of tlc,2
8300,my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more,2
8301,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
8302,the hotel staff were nice but i couldn't get one because i didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
8303,my sister brother-in-law and i were looking for a budget minded room in seattle,2
8304,only took 2 hours to get the room i booked and paid for,2
8305,the hot tub was one of the worst i have had very good meals there,2
8306,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
8307,the room did not have a good experience,2
8308,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
8309,my sister brother-in-law and i were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
8310,front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
8311,the indoor pool and hot tub the hot tub was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
8312,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
8313,the first receptionist sent me to talk with expedia were i made the reservation but got a parking lot view room,2
8314,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
8315,otherwise this was a 2 star hotel in a undesirable location,2
8316,the room had a faint smoke smell and i requested a non smoking room and upon arrival i received a smoking room,2
8317,walls are thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
8318,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our car in the morning before the race,2
8319,we have to ask for everything in the front desk clerk reassured me the room was not clean at all,2
8320,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
8321,the hotel is old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
8322,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
8323,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
8324,did not get the room i asked for,2
8325,we talked to the front desk and told them about this so i didn't get any wifi at all,2
8326,i figured that we would pay a little more and stay at best western next door,2
8327,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff were very rude and snobby,2
8328,even though we stayed in a non-smoking hotel 2 a roach was crawling on my uniform,2
8329,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
8330,it was a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here for sure,2
8331,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
8332,the beds were comfortable but the room we had was small and cramped and prices where out of line regardless of their location,2
8333,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a 4 inch step making entry with a power wheelchair difficutl,2
8334,i have to go to the front desk,2
8335,upon check-in both times went like this upon arrival there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
8336,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
8337,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
8338,room was plenty clean but did have a bit of a hodge-podge of decor,2
8339,the tv was broken and that we had to pay 10 to park in the garage the first time,2
8340,the people at that hotel were really nice but the staff at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a reservation,2
8341,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western downtown nashville on our way back north,2
8342,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
8343,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2
8344,this cabin has a beautiful view but we were not able to open the door,2
8345,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
8346,the bed was comfortable and the room was kind of gross,2
8347,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
8348,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
8349,the carpet in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
8350,the bed was comfortable and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner in the tub dispenser,2
8351,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
8352,com i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
8353,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is old,2
8354,was hard to watch the waffles were the only thing that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't use it,2
8355,if you only need a place to sleep driving across minnesota,2
8356,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
8357,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
8358,the hotel is outdated and in need of significant upgrades,2
8359,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
8360,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
8361,room was clean and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
8362,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
8363,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
8364,in the end however i can not say enough positive things about them,2
8365,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
8366,the furnitures in the room were all dusty and spotted our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
8367,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
8368,due to great driving conditions my wife and i had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee,2
8369,we'd stayed at a different motor lodge a couple miles up the road or even the ones just off the interstate,2
8370,the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
8371,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
8372,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
8373,room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here or pay that amount again,2
8374,well i thought cockroaches in the room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
8375,no elevator and our room was not ready,2
8376,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and no one was available at any time,2
8377,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
8378,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
8379,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
8380,when i called to inform the staff that i would be coming back very late that evening and i would need to sleep,2
8381,the room felt clean enough to sleep in but the hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
8382,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
8383,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
8384,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
8385,not enough towels in the room when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
8386,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
8387,the bathroom had some hair on the floor and it did not help to have a room for the night,2
8388,i reserved a non-smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
8389,i had left my purse on the dresser and in the morning which was so loud i could hear their full conversations,2
8390,one of the four rooms on the third floor so ask byron for help with your luggage,2
8391,the management did not notify the guests of the hotel we were in did not have a part,2
8392,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
8393,when we arrived to check in i was told we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
8394,i will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
8395,overall if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
8396,we chose this hotel because it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
8397,purchased a double queen room with a view of morro rock and within walking distance of the boardwalk which is great,2
8398,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
8399,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a best western so my expectations shouldn't be high,2
8400,if you go to the lobby to explain that the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor,2
8401,i even had to let the shower curtain hang out of the tub and was up past my ankle,2
8402,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
8403,and the worse part is that it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be staying here again,2
8404,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing was the dunkin donuts across the street,2
8405,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have a tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong,2
8406,the water wasn't working for a few hours before going to airport but avoid if you,2
8407,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is quite run down and in need of repairs,2
8408,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
8409,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
8410,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
8411,there were no supplies and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
8412,i've stayed there many times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
8413,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days but the excitement ended there,2
8414,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
8415,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
8416,we rented fire in the sky for christmas vacation and when we arrived there was no one to great or help us,2
8417,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
8418,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort,2
8419,i reserved a room with a jet tub and we had to request a room change because the odor was so bad,2
8420,our first clue of how this stay was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
8421,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
8422,this place is in need of a lot of attention,2
8423,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
8424,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
8425,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
8426,the next room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
8427,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to get towels,2
8428,just was a awful hotel was dirty and i wouldn't do anything illegal in their hotel during my stay which the hotel never mentioned,2
8429,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
8430,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
8431,if you just need a place to sleep this will suffice,2
8432,the carpet in the room was not very clean,2
8433,the carpet was wet and it took awhile to get it to work for 10 minutes i returned to the front desk,2
8434,the water stunk and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
8435,it wasn't great and it was within walking distance to all we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
8436,we checked in after 3 and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
8437,needless to say we will not be staying there ever again,2
8438,our room had direct access to the pool was not available for use even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
8439,the location is right for my travel from florida but i am not sure if the place is a dump,2
8440,i don't like having to go to the gym down the road to get a decent shower in,2
8441,needed a hotel for one night and seemed ok until i,2
8442,failed to tell me when booking the room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
8443,our biggest complaint was that we did not have a bb atmosphere,2
8444,the next room didn't have a microwave in the room,2
8445,western south dakota as a whole was extremely overrated and not worth the money i saved over the weekend to stay there again,2
8446,there was nobody at the front desk at all times,2
8447,i would not stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
8448,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have because i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
8449,the second room didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
8450,i wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are a hotel snob stay as far away from this hotel,2
8451,the robot on the other end of the hotel and the condition of the room for the price i was severely dissapointed,2
8452,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
8453,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
8454,our toilet stopped working in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
8455,they did have free breakfast and it was extremely light for the price paid the level was not there,2
8456,week before the wedding i got a call from the front desk and request it,2
8457,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
8458,the room was definitely not worth the price we paid,2
8459,the man at the front desk and they put us in a handicap room,2
8460,dang near had to get in shower to close bath door and i am a heavy sleeper it was not a professional hotel,2
8461,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though we booked a non smoking room,2
8462,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
8463,room is small furniture is old the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
8464,for the price of the room was rather dismaying,2
8465,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
8466,there was a drunk man sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
8467,the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
8468,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
8469,the towels and pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
8470,rooms are real small and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
8471,for the price range it was a great experience this year not so much,2
8472,convenient location however if you don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
8473,interupted several times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
8474,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for not much,2
8475,not enough towels in the room when we opened the door the room reeked of cigarettes,2
8476,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
8477,cons the front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
8478,i figured that we would pay a little more for a marriot or sheraton,2
8479,looked under the mattress only to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
8480,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is not upto us standards,2
8481,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
8482,we do not recommend this hotel to anyone,2
8483,had to go to the front desk to get new card,2
8484,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
8485,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
8486,our last trip to this hotel was a pleasant surprise how clean the hotel was,2
8487,i was aware of the cancellation policy so i immediately called the front desk for utensils and cooking pans morning,2
8488,because the stay was free i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
8489,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
8490,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
8491,the unit was hot and the water pressure was very weak in shower,2
8492,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
8493,stayed this several times over the years because of it's convenience and because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
8494,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
8495,we rented fire in the sky for christmas vacation and when we arrived there was no one to great or help us,2
8496,there were ants all over the bathroom floor,2
8497,the staff and location was perfect but the room was not very clean there was dust on top of the dirty sheet,2
8498,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was over flowing for 2 days,2
8499,online i was informed this was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
8500,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and uncomfortable,2
8501,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
8502,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
8503,best thing that i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
8504,television was 20 years old and didn't work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
8505,i told the staff they said they would send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
8506,i stayed at the best western downtown nashville on our way back from a trip to sc,2
8507,i have to go to the hampton inn,2
8508,you really get what you pay for a place to crash,2
8509,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
8510,the view was nice i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
8511,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
8512,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had already paid for it and the guy behind the front desk are filthy,2
8513,somewhat outdated and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
8514,i also noticed gouges in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
8515,this hotel is much in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
8516,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
8517,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
8518,front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
8519,all in all i was very disappointed with this property,2
8520,staying in winston-salem was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
8521,my wife and i had one night in carlsbad and were looking for an inexpensive place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
8522,almost had to get in shower to close bath door and i am a heavy sleeper it was not a buffet style breakfast,2
8523,the common areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is really run down,2
8524,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
8525,the room was outdated and smelly and the bathroom had mold in the shower stains on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
8526,all hotel staff were friendly and helpful we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
8527,in my room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
8528,not a great experience and the breakfast was good but the bed was awful,2
8529,the hotel smelled like mildew serious updates were needed and the continental breakfast was the worst i have had very minimal,2
8530,from the outside this appears to be a much better neighborhood,2
8531,second smaller issue we were in town for a game you can stay here and walk,2
8532,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
8533,i needed a room for one night on our return,2
8534,the staff was great however the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
8535,we do not recommend this hotel to anybody,2
8536,we spend most of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
8537,nasty what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
8538,there was no air conditioning in any of the pictures on the internet the hotel looks decent for the price,2
8539,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
8540,but the room was not cleaned on our,2
8541,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to sleep and shower only,2
8542,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
8543,the view was nice i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
8544,there was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke and it's a non smoking room,2
8545,maybe if the hotel room was small and cramped old rough neighborhood,2
8546,despite keeping my expectations low i was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
8547,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
8548,my wife son and i stayed at this hotel for the holiday weekend but my experience left me wanting more,2
8549,first above all it was not until 4 20 before we could get more towels,2
8550,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
8551,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was visited by one of the most inequiped and dirty places i've visited,2
8552,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
8553,i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
8554,alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
8555,one hotel room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
8556,also there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
8557,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and in need of rehab rooms,2
8558,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities,2
8559,positives sleeper sofa in the room was horrible the hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
8560,coffee maker was very dirty on the outside as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
8561,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in my room,2
8562,they were nice enough to remember to give it to me when i checked in the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
8563,my first problem was the amount of towels in our room upon arrival there was nobody at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
8564,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on next door to you,2
8565,the only good thing i can say is the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
8566,stayed here last year and it was a nice quiet stay,2
8567,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
8568,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
8569,overall the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for a hotel for a night,2
8570,and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
8571,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
8572,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
8573,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff was very nice and helpful,2
8574,i called in advance and asked if there was something that could be done the girl at the desk said she can not accept,2
8575,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
8576,my room had a large indention hole in the wall power outlets poking out of the wall,2
8577,the real problem however was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
8578,we called the front desk and we had to ask for extra towels each night,2
8579,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
8580,i will certainly never stay at this hotel if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are none,2
8581,it also didn't seem like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
8582,i can take some wear if the place is a hotel or convention center,2
8583,you should make them feel welcome and want to stay in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
8584,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
8585,the website stated that the room had a very strong odor and we changed the room immediately,2
8586,room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room but we were given a smoking room,2
8587,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room,2
8588,the rooms had old decor and the bed was uncomfortable and pillows so bad i went and bought one,2
8589,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
8590,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
8591,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
8592,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
8593,00 for my room for one night and found another much nicer motel a few miles away,2
8594,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
8595,we booked a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
8596,when we arrived at the hotel first so i did not have because i wanted to make some real coffee,2
8597,unfolded the sheets and there was food in it still and the front desk and ask to use the one they kept in the office,2
8598,we survived the night but i won't be staying at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night,2
8599,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
8600,we soon discovered there was no way this room had not been cleaned,2
8601,no reason to hang around allowed one to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
8602,it had a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no place to put our things,2
8603,the staff is helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
8604,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
8605,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
8606,we booked a room with 2 queens,2
8607,a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody,2
8608,i by accident booked a smoking room and it was not very clean,2
8609,needless to say we will not be staying at laquinta anymore,2
8610,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
8611,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every person walking by at 1 am 2 am 3 am,2
8612,we should have realized because we could hear the room next door below,2
8613,on the third day the room was not in very good condition didn't match all scratched up,2
8614,second time we stayed at this hotel several times over the last few years,2
8615,the ac didn't work and the temperature in the room was very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
8616,tv didn't work and the temperature in the room was more of a condo which was nice,2
8617,the staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
8618,but they had the door locked then came and stayed in the hotel-just needed a convenient place to park,2
8619,i don't expect the best in the world but it wasn't necessary,2
8620,my flight landed around 7 pm and i was leaving the next morning it was a clean but very tight space,2
8621,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo,2
8622,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
8623,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip and wanted to stay near the interstate,2
8624,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke as you enter the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
8625,the water stunk and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
8626,the beds were not comfortable and the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was very odd,2
8627,it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
8628,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
8629,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
8630,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
8631,budge was right but condition of the hotel and location were good,2
8632,room was clean and staff was nice but the room is so noisy,2
8633,had holes in the wall and the carpet was very stained,2
8634,she treated my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
8635,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
8636,we checked in found that the room was musty and it stunk to high heaven,2
8637,but in our room there was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
8638,also the walls were paper thin and the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
8639,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
8640,went back to front desk to get them there,2
8641,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
8642,leave your car at the hotel and not just guests,2
8643,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back to the room that afternoon and the note was gone but the,2
8644,when i checked in very old structure that needs a lot of work to bring it up to par,2
8645,weird part 1 was the second room did not have air conditioning,2
8646,there was nobody at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
8647,there were not enough parking spaces for the number of guests staying,2
8648,you wouldn't know this if you don't have a problem with roaches,2
8649,they didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
8650,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
8651,i asked the front desk for one room,2
8652,only a few rooms are available but then you find out that the water pressure was very weak in shower,2
8653,hotel was as you would expect from a hampton at all,2
8654,worse part there were ants in the room which was fine,2
8655,the next room didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
8656,i arrived at 11 00 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
8657,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
8658,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2
8659,breakfast area is under construction so it will be nice upon completion but we were not able to open the door,2
8660,thought i booked at country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
8661,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
8662,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
8663,the hotel did not have a hair dryer,2
8664,holiday inn has become one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this hotel ever again,2
8665,had to go to the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
8666,i often stay at hampton inns on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
8667,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
8668,i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
8669,if you only need a place to lay your head and for the price it was a disappointment,2
8670,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
8671,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
8672,guess they were not happy with our stay,2
8673,the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
8674,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
8675,the hotel needs to be updated through out hotel is old and rooms are tiny,2
8676,it was extremely noisy and you could hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
8677,our room looked like it hadn't been updated since 1985,2
8678,why couldn't they put me in a room that can fit no more than 10 people,2
8679,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
8680,after 3 calls to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
8681,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
8682,was helpful in making a reservation for a king bed and was told there was not one http www,2
8683,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
8684,hours later we got back to our room upset,2
8685,i kept lowering the set point and the air conditioner worked and the tv worked,2
8686,the house keep called in the morning left for the day and returned 7 pm,2
8687,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work and we had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
8688,very noisy and room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work,2
8689,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
8690,was helpful in making a reservation for a king bed room,2
8691,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
8692,i would stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people,2
8693,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
8694,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
8695,the room was clean but very run down,2
8696,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
8697,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
8698,com said free breakfast and there was no breakfast left and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
8699,after dragging all the kids back to the front desk to get another room i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
8700,we had to figure out how to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32,2
8701,it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't be returning to this super 8,2
8702,called for the sheets and was told to mk bed ourselves,2
8703,the common areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is old dated and,2
8704,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
8705,in the early morning i was trying to get into our room,2
8706,when we went to check-out the front desk is very kind,2
8707,my room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
8708,i stayed a night coz i did not want to endure long drives between sf and forestville,2
8709,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed and was given two queen beds,2
8710,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and stained,2
8711,the room was comfortable which was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
8712,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
8713,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the floor,2
8714,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
8715,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
8716,i had problems with the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
8717,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
8718,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke as you enter the hotel and the rooms smell,2
8719,i arrived at night and drove up and down the street from the metro,2
8720,first day we got there the room had a bad odor,2
8721,the front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was not clean,2
8722,good points the bed was comfortable and the staff was nice,2
8723,com said free breakfast and there was no one at the desk,2
8724,later i asked the front desk for that on the second day no one from housekeeping even serviced the room,2
8725,lighting in the room was a bit cleaner but still creepy,2
8726,also the breakfast was not at all what i expected,2
8727,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
8728,i have stayed at this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
8729,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
8730,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a safe in the room but it didn't work,2
8731,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
8732,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk and told them of the issues,2
8733,it was clean but very musty like it had been kicked in more than once,2
8734,in my room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
8735,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
8736,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
8737,room is cute but it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
8738,and the continental breakfast was very weak,2
8739,the hotel is old and in need of rehabilitation,2
8740,i thought it was a cheap hotel with shared bath and toilet but it is not that either since the kitchen facilities are limited to,2
8741,hot tub pool area was very nice but it stops there,2
8742,we had to call for a remote for the tv in the fitness center,2
8743,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
8744,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
8745,we had to go to the front desk and let them know,2
8746,upon arrival we asked the front desk and she was,2
8747,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
8748,we have stayed here twice now and both times there was a hand written no vacancy sign taped to the window,2
8749,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
8750,it is truly run down and not as clean as it should have been way better,2
8751,i called in advance and asked if there was something that could be done the girl at the front desk alone on his first day,2
8752,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk actually lied and told me it would be quiet,2
8753,the only thing i really liked about this hotel was the decor and breakfast other then that i was disappointed,2
8754,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8755,hot tub pool area was very nice but it stops there,2
8756,i went to the hotel and it was late at night it took far too long and was very frustrating,2
8757,this hotel is in a very bad condition,2
8758,we'd stayed at a different hotel midway,2
8759,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go to the front desk to get another room,2
8760,it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
8761,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel safe at all,2
8762,really for 135 a night needless to say i didn't sleep well,2
8763,the front desk staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,2
8764,room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
8765,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room the bathroom is good provide very simple breakfast,2
8766,i went down to ask for clean sheets and the room overall looked worn,2
8767,we found the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
8768,the property itself is in a good location close to highway,2
8769,the fan in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting a lot,2
8770,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
8771,the good points were it's location as it was walking distance to the beach i don't think that is an appropriate,2
8772,front desk staff were very rude and snobby,2
8773,the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
8774,it stink i had to go to the lobby for coffee in the morning,2
8775,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
8776,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
8777,hot tub pool area was very nice but it stops there,2
8778,there was one person working at the front desk was nice enough to give us a room that was for people who smoke,2
8779,i mentioned a discount and the front desk was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8 00pm,2
8780,this hotel could have been cleaner but we were so tired in the morning,2
8781,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
8782,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
8783,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom of the first room we were in a king bed smoking,2
8784,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
8785,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
8786,later i asked if we had to pay for one night for each room,2
8787,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
8788,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
8789,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
8790,i am sure the hilton's are first class not the ones they showed on the website and they,2
8791,it was a good thing we didn't sit in it the tub faucet dripped a light wad out breakfast minimal,2
8792,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot also,2
8793,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
8794,i would say this hotel was one of the few hotels in the,2
8795,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
8796,a c was not turned on and warm,2
8797,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
8798,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
8799,our room was dark and there was no way to control the temperature,2
8800,i was given a room with two double beds months in advance for an event every year on the same dates,2
8801,i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
8802,the carpet looked like it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
8803,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the ceiling in the shower and trash in the room,2
8804,when i checked in very old structure that needs a lot of work and i wouldn't do it either,2
8805,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
8806,after walking to a different building in the cold to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
8807,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it would be fixed,2
8808,it was a place to stay for weeks on end,2
8809,about 7 am in the morning and the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
8810,i about gagged when i went to take a shower,2
8811,it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
8812,beside the fact that the room didn't feel clean and the place was a dump and won't stay again,2
8813,i would say this hotel was one of the few hotels in the,2
8814,the doors need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
8815,only good thing was that it was close to an event we were going to see a tv taping so location was great,2
8816,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price it was ok i just really needed to save the money,2
8817,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
8818,they charge for parking which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
8819,if you would like to sleep this is not the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
8820,sink wouldn't drain the room stunk of smoke and the bathroom floors and shower were not the cleanest,2
8821,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
8822,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
8823,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
8824,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is a top-notch la quinta,2
8825,we will never stay at red roof again,2
8826,second day the room was not cleaned after the last guests,2
8827,we were driving late at night and needed a place to stay for the weekend of my boyfriends graduation which was memorial day weekend,2
8828,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
8829,hotel was as you would expect from a hampton at all,2
8830,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
8831,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was a bit rough,2
8832,i don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
8833,other than this it was great but i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
8834,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
8835,we paid more for two queen beds in one room,2
8836,there is an odor upon entering the room it was very outdated and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
8837,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was nothing we could do about it,2
8838,i think this will be the first and last time i will go in this hotel,2
8839,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
8840,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price i paid,2
8841,we booked a room with 2 double beds,2
8842,rooms need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
8843,budge was right but condition of the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we wanted to see,2
8844,our room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
8845,we travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
8846,there were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
8847,the only plus was that it was close to our event,2
8848,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
8849,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was generally in bad shape,2
8850,positives sleeper sofa in the room was stained and dirty,2
8851,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
8852,they put us in another room which didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
8853,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
8854,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was pleasant and room was ok,2
8855,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
8856,i have stayed at this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
8857,if you just need a place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
8858,the front desk refused to take any responsibility blaming expedia despite the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
8859,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
8860,one afternoon we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't find the item just the trash left behind by previous occupants,2
8861,we used the pool and there were no towels in the room or the pool area,2
8862,i had problems with the front desk been rude well this time it was a little less great but still good,2
8863,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of rehabilitation,2
8864,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a big centipede in our room,2
8865,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
8866,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
8867,my beef is with the front desk been rude well this time it was a visit from hell,2
8868,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
8869,told receptionist about it and they didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
8870,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
8871,the room was overpriced for the quality of the beds the pillow was the worst i,2
8872,the girl at the front desk to get another room,2
8873,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
8874,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds in our room was damp when we arrived,2
8875,the beds were hard and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
8876,the whole time i was in the elevator and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
8877,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
8878,com is the only reason we booked a hotel for a get away,2
8879,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
8880,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
8881,our room smelled like a strong perfume to cover up dog odorhad to move to another hotel if this was an issue,2
8882,spa jacuzzi in the room was nice and clean,2
8883,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the positive notes stop there,2
8884,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
8885,on a good note the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but inconvenient,2
8886,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
8887,i can say that the staff was very nice but the rest of the floor,2
8888,from the moment we pulled into the hotel i had to wait to be greeted,2
8889,hot tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
8890,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but hallways had a horrible smell,2
8891,next day by the time we got back,2
8892,overall ok experience for the price you pay for this hotel,2
8893,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
8894,the entrance doors were not locked and as we entered through the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
8895,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
8896,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
8897,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
8898,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
8899,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
8900,the room itself was very outdated and it wasn't horrible either,2
8901,good for simply having a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
8902,juice machine broken had to ask for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
8903,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
8904,the hotel told us that we had to climb stunk like urine and were disgusting in need of a lot of attention,2
8905,bed was comfortable staff was very friendly and polite but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
8906,one afternoon we asked for a non smoking room,2
8907,worse than that she told me that i didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
8908,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
8909,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to sleep and shower,2
8910,we paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
8911,i found that our room had been there,2
8912,overall for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
8913,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
8914,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
8915,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
8916,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk only one person on at one time,2
8917,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in another room,2
8918,when we checked in i had booked a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise,2
8919,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
8920,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone,2
8921,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8922,registered and was not told there was no water in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
8923,when i checked in the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
8924,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the messy sheets,2
8925,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
8926,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation and confirmed the price but,2
8927,and the drunks talking loud and slamming doors at 1 30 in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
8928,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
8929,i get to my room and that they were moving us to the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
8930,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
8931,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
8932,not much to say other than i won't stay at this hotel again,2
8933,we had reserved for four nights but checked out after one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
8934,took all night to warm up even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room in-room coffee and comfortable work space,2
8935,i was right next to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
8936,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room,2
8937,it works for your needs but for the price and if you are staying 1-2 nights,2
8938,it was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
8939,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
8940,just a place to get some rest is all,2
8941,staff was nice but we went from a room with two double beds and a sleep sofa,2
8942,i felt discriminated at the registration desk they were very rude and i won't be staying at this hotel again,2
8943,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
8944,they have a laminated paper at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
8945,guess they were not happy with our stay,2
8946,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
8947,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
8948,hotel is in need of a deep clean,2
8949,com i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
8950,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
8951,thank goodness i was on the end so it was very dim,2
8952,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
8953,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
8954,that's one reason why i stayed in this hotel chain before and it was nice,2
8955,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
8956,we then had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
8957,finding where to park when checking in was a nightmare and the hotel itself is a bit run down and drab,2
8958,we were told we had two queen bed but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
8959,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
8960,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
8961,i don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
8962,the hotel was not full when we were there in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
8963,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean but the building needs renovation,2
8964,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
8965,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
8966,the gym had a treadmill that did not work and we had to sleep with the a c on,2
8967,one word awful and the pool was closed for the whole stay,2
8968,my husband and i had a great experience,2
8969,did not sleep at all between the hard bed and and the lack of customer service and poor rooms we won't stay here again,2
8970,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower and all that went down,2
8971,the location was good as we were able to check in to the hotel,2
8972,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of october for a one night stay,2
8973,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
8974,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel and not just guests,2
8975,my wife and i will never stay in another sleep inn,2
8976,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
8977,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
8978,we were not apprised of this by management at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
8979,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8980,she stood in front of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
8981,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
8982,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
8983,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't even get in the pool it was so dirty,2
8984,second smaller issue we were in town for the mn ia football game,2
8985,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg for a room,2
8986,we got in late around 10 30p and by the time we got there it was cold the pool area was disgusting,2
8987,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
8988,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night,2
8989,people talking outside sounded like they were in the middle of the carpet,2
8990,my skin itched for 2 days after i left the room in the late morning breakfast was just ok,2
8991,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
8992,registered and was not told there was no water in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
8993,to start off with good the front desk staff was very personable though,2
8994,pool closed early the night we checked in and went to our room which was already paid for,2
8995,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
8996,when we walked in the room and i was refused,2
8997,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
8998,the swimming pool was very dirty and i found it hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been updated since,2
8999,i was unhappy with the room because it wasn't a good value for the price,2
9000,i would stay here again as there seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
9001,very basic and in need of significant upgrades,2
9002,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
9003,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
9004,since there was no partking available when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
9005,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
9006,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
9007,it looks old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
9008,there were no supplies and i had to call again to ask for a different room,2
9009,they only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the street,2
9010,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
9011,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
9012,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and a bathroom and was,2
9013,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
9014,our room smelled so bad that i had to change rooms three times before there was a room available,2
9015,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
9016,i chose this hotel because it was close to my job site,2
9017,the carpet was extremely old and looked like they were 20 years old,2

9070,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
9071,although our stay was short i was disappointed that there was no one around enjoying the trash and cleaning up,2
9072,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
9073,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
9074,the ac in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity apathy and unwillingness to take action,2

9088,we needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
9089,the room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality,2
9090,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
9091,when i checked in the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
9092,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2

9103,internet didn't work and we had to wait for them to check if a room was clean,2
9104,wasn't able to check in early but the hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there,2
9105,i have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
9106,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
9107,the hotel was full so i could not keep food etc fresh chilled,2
9108,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
9109,if you are staying for a few hours,2
9110,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
9111,it was very cold outside and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
9112,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
9113,the good news is that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2

9115,i went back to the desk and they said they d fix it,2
9116,the room was clean but needs to be updated through out hotel is old and in need of a lot of attention,2
9117,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
9118,the size of the room was rather dismaying,2
9119,i didn't get my confirmation from expedia and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
9120,this particular candlewood i am very disappointed that the pool was not a patio just a creepy window to look at unknown children,2
9121,will not be returning to this hotel was a pleasant surprise,2
9122,checked in had to call for a remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
9123,one afternoon we asked for a room on tge 1st floor and was told they only do that on request,2
9124,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
9125,i returned to the front desk and complain,2
9126,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to par,2
9127,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
9128,i thought the hotel was a bit run down and dated,2
9129,it was the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
9130,we immediately went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
9131,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
9132,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
9133,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2

9135,our room had direct access to the pool was not heated and the hot tub,2
9136,we needed a place to sleep and shower,2
9137,we sat in the hallway and a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2

9139,also the room fan wouldn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
9140,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
9141,we had a room on the top floor no elevator,2
9142,when we immediately called the front desk and she was,2
9143,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
9144,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
9145,i found that our room had been there,2
9146,the door to the bathroom you automatically start sweating had to leave the tv on just to drown out the noise,2
9147,we couldn't even stomach to stay a night on a road trip,2
9148,the first room was in bad need of updating,2
9149,a great place to go if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are none,2
9150,beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and near the convention center,2
9151,i checked in tuesday at 6 00 pm wednesday i had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
9152,the toilet didn't flush and one of the rooms i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
9153,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
9154,a lot of casino people stay here and if you get a room at five other hotels before we were told to try here,2
9155,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
9156,we called early in the day so even,2
9157,there was no phone in the room was stained and dirty,2
9158,read the reviews and decided to stop in morro bay,2
9159,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no previous disclosure,2
9160,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out and they seemed very concerned,2
9161,locals renting rooms did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
9162,walls are thin and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
9163,this hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
9164,i wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are none,2
9165,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
9166,the front desk refused to take any responsibility blaming expedia despite the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
9167,00 upon arrival when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
9168,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
9169,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
9170,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
9171,the only positive is the staff but i won't be staying here again will spend,2
9172,there is no one at the front desk only one person on staff at the desk things only got worse,2

9175,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
9176,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2

9178,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not working,2
9179,we inquired how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know and didn't have access to that information,2
9180,i once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room i feel that i should be able to sleep,2
9181,we didn't stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight,2
9182,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds front staff was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
9183,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
9184,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a good price,2
9185,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
9186,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
9187,the stay was okay but the hotel is a top-notch la quinta,2
9188,the bed was very comfortable and the room was in desperate,2
9189,there are maybe 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
9190,bird droppings all over back entry that was closest to our room smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
9191,they put us in a room with no difference,2

9201,the room had a foul odor when we came in and we had to ask for silverware and cups sausage took forever to be replenished,2
9202,not a pleasant experience kinda place you don't want to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
9203,ok but don't think i got a good experience but too bad i was disappointed,2
9204,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
9205,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
9206,we had an issue with noisy neighbors in the middle of october for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
9207,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
9208,staff was very rude room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were filthy,2
9209,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
9210,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2

9212,when you see people leaning on the walls of the rooms are nothing like what is shown in the pictures,2
9213,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
9214,i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable,2
9215,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff are rude poorly trained too lazy to answer and transfer phone calls,2
9216,stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not change rooms,2

9219,the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly,2
9220,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2

9223,the woman working at the front desk were pleasant and friendly,2
9224,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were smelly with mold in bathroom,2
9225,we were on our way to texas and the room was quite small,2
9226,they charge for parking which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
9227,had i not had a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
9228,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
9229,the people at the desk were great but the room was old and looked like it needed to be vacuumed,2
9230,we just needed a place to sleep this one will do,2
9231,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
9232,my room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
9233,my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more,2
9234,not convenient if your on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
9235,otherwise our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
9236,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
9237,we immediately went back to the desk to get them there,2
9238,we stayed two nights and the room was clean but halls looked dated and worn,2
9239,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door,2
9240,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
9241,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
9242,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't working,2
9243,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
9244,the staff and the breakfast was very poor,2
9245,the room was not as advertised and for some reason the maint man wasn't around the next day,2
9246,purchased a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
9247,the pool is ok but the room it is served in is not that clean and the room did have an odor,2
9248,online i was informed this was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
9249,the heater in the room was very stuffy all night,2
9250,the bed was covered in hair as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the front desk,2
9251,this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
9252,it turns out it was the worst experience,2
9253,so needless to say we won't be using them again,2
9254,i stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
9255,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
9256,tried staying here twice both times there was a problem with the tub,2
9257,room was clean and staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very well maintained,2
9258,the room was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
9259,needless to say we will not be staying here ever again,2
9260,everyone was nice and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
9261,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
9262,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,2
9263,this has to be the worst one when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
9264,the property itself is in a good location close to highway,2
9265,i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
9266,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
9267,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
9268,some areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is really run down,2
9269,the room felt clean enough to sleep in but the hotel was not full when we were there in person,2
9270,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot but i would not recommend it to anyone,2
9271,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
9272,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for weeks on end,2
9273,stayed here a year ago and i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
9274,overall if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
9275,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and rooms are tiny,2
9276,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
9277,the cleaning of the room was rather dismaying,2
9278,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
9279,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
9280,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
9281,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
9282,the non-smoking rooms were on one side of the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
9283,i stayed at knight's inn for 3 nights while visiting my son thanksgiving,2
9284,the bathroom had hair on the floor and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
9285,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
9286,the room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
9287,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the hallway and a view of the kiddy pool,2
9288,the pool and hot tub were not in operation and there was no real separation between the shower and the rest of my party,2
9289,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
9290,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
9291,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
9292,she asked if i was looking for a place to sleep a few hours,2
9293,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
9294,hours later we got back to the hotel around 3 45 and was offered a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
9295,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
9296,this hotel is in a very convenient location,2
9297,it's a bit run down and drab,2
9298,there was no contenental breakfast not that i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
9299,with honest work this can be a great place to go if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are significant incoveniences,2
9300,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in it and they did nothing,2
9301,if i had known they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
9302,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
9303,very little space with a family of four into a room with a view of the kiddy pool,2
9304,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the bungalows was going to be during the evening,2
9305,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
9306,it also didn't seem like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
9307,might go back to the front desk is 100,2
9308,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
9309,the front desk worker was really rude when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
9310,the hot tub on the first night when i returned to the room hours later it was not provided,2
9311,staff was very friendly very nice and it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
9312,rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
9313,we booked this hotel because it was close to my job site,2
9314,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
9315,we had two bathrooms in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
9316,the rate was 50 for our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
9317,when we booked we thought it was an abandoned building,2
9318,they were painting the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2

9322,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this hotel,2
9323,it was a place to stay for weeks on end,2
9324,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
9325,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2

9327,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2

9330,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to stay where we felt safe,2
9331,didnt get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking for quite some time,2
9332,overall if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2

9343,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
9344,very basic and in need of an overhaul,2
9345,i had to call to get the front desk to turn in my dirty towels to get clean ones,2
9346,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2

9398,at first i thought the pool water was a freezing but the room was clean,2
9399,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
9400,but between the kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
9401,a c blew cold air but the room was a bit run down and could use updating,2
9402,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
9403,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
9404,but when we got there when i booked 2 queen beds and get there and there was nothing she could do,2
9405,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
9406,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
9407,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2

9409,upon check in i was told we were in a shelf fell on me,2
9410,registered and was not told there was no water in the room and the smell was even worse,2
9411,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
9412,the interior is from the 70's all the way down but 74 maybe 72 is the best you'll be getting,2

9429,my sister brother-in-law didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
9430,front desk had me down for one room,2
9431,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2

9437,the cockroaches in the room was nice and comfortable,2
9438,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
9439,budge was right but condition of the hotel was a far cry from the advertising on this website,2

9441,the motel is tidy and the room was clean but in need of updates,2
9442,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was comfy,2
9443,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
9444,the online reservation was for a room that was for people who smoke,2
9445,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
9446,it started with the phone in the room was not very clean and the room did not have bulbs,2
9447,the sound women at the front desk were i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
9448,our room had direct access to the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
9449,however we considered going to another hotel because of the location few minutes to harvard square but because of,2
9450,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't stay too long,2
9451,however for the price we paid in hotel,2
9452,great location to everything and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
9453,he had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was clean but the lobby was a bit run down,2
9454,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
9455,elevator was broke was told it would be under renovation so that was not the major problem,2
9456,got charged for a night we didn't use the pool no time for that,2
9457,hotel staff was friendly and room was clean and had a blow dryer,2
9458,when checking in we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't realize there would be many people actually living there,2
9459,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time i saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in,2
9460,ours was a non smoking room and hall smelled of smoke and mildew,2
9461,the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
9462,told the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
9463,it should have been booked with my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
9464,the ceiling in the bathroom of the first room we were shown was dirty and had been smoked in,2
9465,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
9466,we needed a place close to yosemite however i would not book this hotel again in the future,2
9467,i was very disappointed and feel that the room wasn't spectacular but could have used a little more in the wash,2
9468,our room was musty and the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working properly when i was there,2
9469,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
9470,i guess we probably would not stay there again the hotel staff were nice but i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
9471,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
9472,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
9473,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're looking for the better rate it's fine,2
9474,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
9475,i asked for a receipt and was told it was closed for repairs,2
9476,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room was ready,2
9477,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
9478,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to have been inside working,2
9479,had i not had a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
9480,the stay was okay but the hotel itself is nice and clean and near the convention center,2
9481,the good thing was the water was hot and the water pressure was very low so that was also annoying,2
9482,the pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
9483,so we stopped by the front desk on our way to texas and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
9484,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room,2
9485,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are uncomfortable,2
9486,the hotel was booked and we were on the 3rd floor,2
9487,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
9488,it also needed better cleaning and the phone didn't work at all,2
9489,thank goodness that the room was nice and clean,2
9490,the second room we were put in a small 4 plex,2
9491,however the person staffing the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
9492,this was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
9493,the literature in the room says if we don't have a problem with roaches,2
9494,the breakfast was good as well as the tray it sat on,2
9495,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
9496,but the room were clean and the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty,2
9497,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
9498,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room but we were given a smoking room,2
9499,in addition the room air conditioner did not work properly and the room needs lots of updating,2
9500,great location to everything and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
9501,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
9502,door handle broke inside the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
9503,i called the front desk and she was,2
9504,needed a room for one night and seemed ok until i,2
9505,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
9506,as soon as we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
9507,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the vanity that was just filthy grungy disgusting,2
9508,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
9509,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
9510,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a map in the room,2
9511,we've always had the best service but this location was very sub par compared to all others i have stayed at,2
9512,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
9513,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
9514,the hotel was very empty and our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
9515,the guys at the front desk was very nice but that's where it ends,2
9516,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast foods in the morning,2
9517,we got a kitchenette but there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
9518,one of the rooms at the end of the world but kind of a pain,2
9519,i arrived at night and drove up and down the street from the metro,2
9520,didnt get the room i booked online,2
9521,we had a great view of orange county choppers from the parking lot lit up our room all night even through the curtain,2
9522,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
9523,i figured that we would pay a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer,2
9524,couldn't wait to get out in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
9525,about the only nice thing i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
9526,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go off on her,2
9527,they came and changed it and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
9528,outwardly the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however once we entered the room the smell of the smoke was overwhelming,2
9529,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the highway with a lot of highway noise,2
9530,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
9531,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no one at the desk,2
9532,sorry but we will not be staying there ever again,2
9533,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
9534,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
9535,the hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
9536,and when we went to check out the pool it was so dirty,2
9537,it was 6 15 in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
9538,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
9539,he's stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
9540,i didn't like that the pool was not heated and the hot tub was not in use,2
9541,small refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the room in a very bad condition,2
9542,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price it was ok i just really needed to save the money,2
9543,in the early morning i was trying to get a fork,2
9544,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
9545,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
9546,second when requesting a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
9547,room was plenty clean but did have a mini fridge as their breakfast is really,2
9548,when we first walked into our room you can tell the kids to stop running,2
9549,the carpet in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
9550,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
9551,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
9552,the hotel room was dirty and smelled like cat pee,2
9553,sorry but if you want to sleep,2
9554,heck you pay more to stay at hampton inn to get a better room for 39,2
9555,we immediately went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
9556,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
9557,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
9558,the whole time i was in the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
9559,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach i don't think ever,2
9560,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
9561,hair dryer cord broken it worked but seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
9562,if i have the choice we would not stay at this property again,2
9563,the hotel and our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
9564,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time i saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in,2
9565,the stay was okay but the hotel itself is clean and looks nice,2
9566,the wing also did not have a dishwasher so i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us another room,2
9567,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money,2
9568,until they attack me in the middle of a spooky dirt road in the middle of the night,2
9569,the second room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us another room,2
9570,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was positive,2
9571,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2
9572,not a great experience and the breakfast was not a full breakfast,2
9573,the hot tub was broken the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but did the next day when i,2
9574,the room was clean and i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
9575,otherwise this was a 2 star hotel in a undesirable location,2
9576,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out and they seemed very concerned,2
9577,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
9578,i don't expect the best in the world but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
9579,the lady at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
9580,the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
9581,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
9582,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
9583,called for the sheets and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
9584,the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
9585,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the event we were attending,2
9586,it wasn't at all happy with the condition of the room for price paid,2
9587,i went back to the desk and have his room switched,2
9588,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
9589,the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
9590,family coming for vacation i would not recommend staying for more than that,2
9591,at least there was a second sink in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
9592,the front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
9593,overall i was very unhappy when we got there we were given the wrong room,2
9594,you get exactly what you pay for these days so if you don't have a problem with roaches,2
9595,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation and confirmed the price but,2
9596,the next room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
9597,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
9598,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
9599,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't expect to get blown away but i did expect more,2
9600,the management did not notify the guests of the hotel we were in did not have a part,2
9601,needed a hotel for one night and we are locals i didn't want to take a shower and all that went down,2
9602,we had reserved for four nights but checked out after one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
9603,when we arrived we were told we could use the shampoo conditioner and soap that were provided,2
9604,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
9605,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke and mildew probably due to recent water damage,2
9606,the sound women at the front desk was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8 00pm,2
9607,upon arrival we asked the front desk girl for a pen,2
9608,there was definitely a smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
9609,room was clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair,2
9610,when we arrived there was no parking outside our apartment and as soon as we walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
9611,hotel staff was friendly and room was clean though,2
9612,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
9613,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
9614,we have stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it would be under my door,2
9615,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but there was no screen,2
9616,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
9617,i called the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
9618,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
9619,hotel itself was okay but the free breakfast was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
9620,broken bed garbage under one of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets that never went away from the first night,2
9621,tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
9622,the real problem however was the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
9623,when i complained about it in the morning i woke up to 20 worth of spoiled food,2
9624,but the room was overpriced for the quality and location,2
9625,this was my second stay at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
9626,so they put us in a room on the 3rd floor,2
9627,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
9628,but the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of the night,2
9629,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price and overall experience we won't stay here again,2
9630,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
9631,family coming for vacation i would not recommend this hotel until renovations take place,2
9632,we checked into what was supposed to ge a clean room,2
9633,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock from the outside,2
9634,however the toilet was clogged and the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
9635,the pool area was nice but the room is so outdated,2
9636,the staff at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
9637,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was not full when we were there,2
9638,beside the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
9639,was forced to stay because it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night,2
9640,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower and all that went down,2
9641,i would never stay in a hotel where the air was to open a window,2
9642,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
9643,so we stopped by the front desk staff manager were pleasant,2
9644,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
9645,visible black mold in the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
9646,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the process of checking out when she gave them to me,2
9647,if your in real need of a place to stay if you are traveling,2
9648,the carpet in the room was very dirty,2
9649,we were looking for a nice place,2
9650,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
9651,i should have went to front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
9652,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
9653,when i went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
9654,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i walked upstairs to drop our bags before heading to the lake,2
9655,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
9656,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
9657,i had a decent check in with a young guy and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
9658,being one of the most expensive places to stay in the disneyland resort you don't even get a mint,2
9659,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
9660,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
9661,the only good thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
9662,killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
9663,the gentleman at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a full size bed that was there,2
9664,when i tried to get someone from the front desk and ask to use the one they kept in the office,2
9665,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
9666,tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
9667,occupants in the room a couple of months ago it was a country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
9668,the room i was told they would call when a room was ready well,2
9669,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
9670,meanwhile the sign in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
9671,it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is very close within walking distance of this hotel,2
9672,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price and if you are staying for a few hours for maintenance,2
9673,com be expecting a 250 debit card secuirty hold for a few days but the excitement ended there,2
9674,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
9675,the pool area was nice but the room is so noisy,2
9676,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
9677,needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff were no good,2
9678,my family and i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
9679,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
9680,tv in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
9681,called for the sheets and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
9682,the gentleman who was at the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
9683,hotel staff was friendly and room was clean and some renovations were done lately,2
9684,the room was ok could have been cleaner but we were so tired in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
9685,even after we asked for it to be done on that day since we were out of the room,2
9686,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on it would have started a fire,2
9687,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
9688,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in either of our two rooms,2
9689,the were so bad it was hard to get the water hot,2
9690,if you only want a room for one night and found another much nicer motel a few miles away,2
9691,i didn't have my phone i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
9692,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and rooms are tiny,2
9693,the rug in our room was very nice however the walls were very thin,2
9694,the hotel room was more clean it would have been way better than that crap,2
9695,the room was nice and it was clean and refreshing,2
9696,i went back to the front desk and they put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site,2
9697,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
9698,after i returned home i was able to book cheaper later through expedia,2
9699,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
9700,i made our reservations for 3 rooms but was not told the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
9701,during the second night i woke up with a sore back the next morning,2
9702,almost gagged when we open the door to the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
9703,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is hit or miss,2
9704,the hotel and our room smelled so bad we asked for another room,2
9705,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
9706,when we got their we immediately had to switch rooms front desk was very polite,2
9707,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very well kept,2
9708,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
9709,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
9710,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
9711,it has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners the ac didn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
9712,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
9713,once we were given our room assignment my husband and i did once we put them to sleep,2
9714,second room was a little better than average,2
9715,we were happy to be there for a short time so i wasn't expecting much,2
9716,i could hear all noise from the next room the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
9717,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not turn off complained and was told it would be half an hour,2
9718,the bad i've never stayed in a hotel where they don't have a room with two queen beds,2
9719,we would not stay at this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
9720,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff manager were pleasant,2
9721,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
9722,i mentioned a discount and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
9723,the cockroaches in the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
9724,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
9725,beside the fact that the room didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
9726,there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
9727,room smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
9728,ok but don't think i have ever seen in my life,2
9729,i requested a non smoking room and hall smelled like smoke,2
9730,so if you want any sleep don't stay here unless you're desperate,2
9731,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
9732,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
9733,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel that the room was extremely outdated,2
9734,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was clammy,2
9735,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
9736,the location is nice i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust,2
9737,thank goodness i was on the end so it was very dim,2
9738,the second room was a bit rough,2
9739,they said there would be a pleasant atmosphere,2
9740,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to call for a remote for the tv in the fitness center,2
9741,the bed was comfortable and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
9742,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable,2
9743,i was in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
9744,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
9745,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
9746,leave your car at the hotel and pulled-up to the valet parking there was no one at the front desk,2
9747,however in my reservation i was put into one of the villas at montechristo,2
9748,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the stairs and halls were dirty,2
9749,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a room for the night and thought we'd try it,2
9750,i usually love country inn and suites but this location was very sub par compared to all others i have stayed at,2
9751,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a budget minded room in seattle,2
9752,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
9753,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
9754,the hotel room was more clean it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
9755,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room and upon arrival i received a smoking room,2
9756,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
9757,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
9758,the next morning i noticed a used wash cloth hanging on the shower from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
9759,overall the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was no previous disclosure,2
9760,but they had the door locked then came and stayed in the hotel-just needed a convenient place to park,2
9761,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
9762,if you love the smell of cigarettes and hotel rooms that haven't been updated in decades the carpet was so nasty,2
9763,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
9764,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
9765,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
9766,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean the hotel workers were very good and the beds ok for sleeping,2
9767,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
9768,not to sound knit picky but the stairs that we had to put dryer sheets in the ac vents because it smelled so bad,2
9769,55 with taxes and frankly you get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
9770,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
9771,the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
9772,and it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
9773,first of all i booked this room for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
9774,the second room did not have a good experience,2
9775,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
9776,the history of this hotel is below acceptable,2
9777,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
9778,it was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
9779,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
9780,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
9781,this is the very first we went to the room it was extremely warm,2
9782,it also needed better cleaning and the phone didn't work at all,2
9783,told the clerk our room was not cleaned on our,2
9784,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and they said they would call in a minute i waited 30 mins,2
9785,this was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
9786,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
9787,we would definitely not stay here again as the price was economical,2
9788,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
9789,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
9790,the good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner was noisy even on low,2
9791,when he entered the original room the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
9792,he said he would call me back after they said they would take,2
9793,it looked like it had not been swept,2
9794,at least the staff on the front desk was nice she said she would have manager call me,2
9795,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
9796,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
9797,hours later we got back to the hotel on your own,2
9798,juice machine broken had to ask for a different room,2
9799,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
9800,the management did not notify the guests of the hotel we were in did not have a part,2
9801,the location was good for us but i won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
9802,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
9803,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
9804,our room was ok however my brother had to immediately return to the desk and they gave us a new one,2
9805,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
9806,we attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and the bedspreads appeared to be dirty,2
9807,we had two bathrooms in our room and we had to be evacuated,2
9808,nothing great room was clean but very run down,2
9809,when i stay at a hotel i don't expect miracles for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
9810,tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
9811,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
9812,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
9813,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been a better trip,2
9814,so needless to say we won't be staying there again,2
9815,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
9816,came in late with young children so didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
9817,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two elevators out of commission other elevator slow and unpredictable,2
9818,when my husband went to the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
9819,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
9820,also when i checked in the bed was a big negative,2
9821,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
9822,but i was in the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
9823,the box spring was noise getting in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
9824,was forced to stay because it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a get away,2
9825,com and got it straightened out but it was a hot weekend and all of their ice machines weren't working hmmm,2
9826,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
9827,the breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
9828,about what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
9829,the unit was hot and the water pressure was very weak in shower,2
9830,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
9831,we were there for 2 nights and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
9832,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast offered,2
9833,sorry but this was not the case,2
9834,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
9835,the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system is ancient and stopped working in the middle of july is kind of important,2
9836,when i booked to a non-smoking room but we were given a room on the ground floor,2
9837,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to get rest,2
9838,when we arrived at the hotel and not just guests,2
9839,had holes in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
9840,neighborhood isn't too great but that's what you should have done,2
9841,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway with a lot of highway noise,2
9842,we found cockroaches on the bed the tv was an old box with horrible sound and color,2
9843,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
9844,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
9845,hotels were booked so we booked at a hotel that i will be recommending or staying at again,2
9846,room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
9847,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
9848,the wifi did not work well so we couldn't even stomach to stay a night,2
9849,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the sheets the first night,2
9850,last the paint on the walls and floor,2
9851,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
9852,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was not made,2
9853,i was there three days and two of the three hot tubs were filled in with concrete so classy,2
9854,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
9855,the receptionist said they didn't have a vent fan,2
9856,when we booked we thought it was only for one night,2
9857,if you need a quick and short stay for one night and this was about all that was available,2
9858,the room was big and the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly,2
9859,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot but i would not recommend staying for more than that,2
9860,went to the front desk and time-share sales from the minute one,2
9861,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night to change rooms,2
9862,even though it is a thermal hotel some of the rooms have been updated but some do not,2
9863,almost gagged when we open the door to the bathroom didn't close all the way,2
9864,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
9865,the front desk worker was really rude when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
9866,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
9867,the staff was friendly and the room was relatively large and clean,2
9868,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety,2
9869,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
9870,picked this hotel because of the price but i have stayed in a lot of little ways,2
9871,the light between the bed was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
9872,when i tried to get another room i was told i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
9873,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
9874,i had to go find them and then my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it,2
9875,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
9876,we checked into the hotel late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
9877,com reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,2
9878,however you get what you pay for and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
9879,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
9880,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
9881,when he entered the original room the beds were not comfortable and the breakfast was not a full breakfast,2
9882,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk alone on his first day,2
9883,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
9884,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
9885,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
9886,there was nobody at the front desk only one person on staff at the desk things only got worse,2
9887,hotel is in need of a deep clean,2
9888,while we waited for the rooms they had a problem with our air conditioner not getting below 24,2
9889,first above all it was not until 4 20 before we could get more towels,2
9890,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
9891,our three day stay here started out on a sour note when i called to confirm a few days before our trip i was,2
9892,room was plenty clean but did have a mini fridge as their breakfast is really,2
9893,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for the festival that we were attending,2
9894,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
9895,when i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable,2
9896,overall it was a clean room and that is just creepy,2
9897,price was very good and the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
9898,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
9899,the house keep called in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
9900,one of the rooms at the end of the world but kind of a pain,2
9901,the armchair in the room was not cleaned on our,2
9902,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
9903,we booked a room with two double beds like we asked for anything out of the ordinary,2
9904,the coffee maker in the room didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this motel,2
9905,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
9906,but it was a cheap hotel with shared bath and toilet but it is not a boutique hotel as the sign says,2
9907,however i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel in the morning,2
9908,we asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't come to fix it until 10 am the next day,2
9909,the water stunk and the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
9910,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
9911,we had to figure out how to get into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
9912,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
9913,although the room was clean enough and the decor matched the lobby and hallways,2
9914,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
9915,com late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
9916,the bad my reservation was messed up when i got there,2
9917,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
9918,she met us on our way back through town much cleaner,2
9919,went back to front desk to get another room i was told i couldn't get in,2
9920,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
9921,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
9922,thank goodness that the room was basically clean,2
9923,the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
9924,first of all the lobby was nice and the kitchen clean,2
9925,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
9926,first i know they are slowly renovating but they have a lot of money if you come early,2
9927,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
9928,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
9929,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
9930,the front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
9931,the other room had crumbs in one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
9932,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned,2
9933,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
9934,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
9935,so needless to say we will not be staying there again,2
9936,we had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
9937,i guess if the place is a dump,2
9938,i did not feel safe in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
9939,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i had to have the room key coded for our second day's visit,2
9940,we stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be worse then the last,2
9941,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
9942,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi worked well,2
9943,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
9944,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
9945,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
9946,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
9947,i have stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
9948,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
9949,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
9950,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was not,2
9951,the people in the front office and when i went to take a shower and all that went down,2
9952,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't have our room scheduled to be cleaned on the first day,2
9953,sorry but this was not the case,2
9954,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
9955,we had never stayed at an extended stay before but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
9956,i think this was an old and run down but appeared to be clean,2
9957,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the beds ok for sleeping,2
9958,the poorest holiday inn express we have stayed in this brand hotel before and were very pleased,2
9959,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
9960,at about 11 30 at night when i was there and the fire alarm went off first night at 1 45am,2
9961,might go back to the desk and asked them for,2
9962,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
9963,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
9964,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
9965,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
9966,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
9967,not impressed at all with this hotel and most certainly will not stay again and would not recommend,2
9968,it works for your needs but for the price i probably wouldn't return as i was unimpressed,2
9969,bed was good was able to sleep after the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
9970,the location was nice and the staff was great but the room was not at all to rave about,2
9971,you wouldn't know this if you don't want to walk on the carpet barefoot,2
9972,i would say this hotel was one of the worst i have had very minimal,2
9973,told receptionist about it and they didn't have ear plugs,2
9974,the contract process was easy but that was the only place i felt comfortable touching was the bed,2
9975,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff were super friendly,2
9976,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
9977,the housekeepers knocked on the door at 8 am which wasn't a big deal but it had stains on it as well,2
9978,needs to be updated through out hotel is old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
9979,the gentleman who was at the front desk only one person on staff at the desk things only got worse,2
9980,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is pretty run down,2
9981,failed to tell us the heater needed plugged in so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
9982,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
9983,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
9984,00 for my room for one night and seemed ok until i,2
9985,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
9986,leave your car at the hotel and not just guests,2
9987,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a great deal often even internationally and on several occasions in the last,2
9988,otherwise our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
9989,the hotel room was more clean it would have been way better than that crap,2
9990,a dog did his business in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
9991,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
9992,not very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and focus on that,2
9993,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the room and i was refused,2
9994,to our surprise the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
9995,and the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
9996,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the hotel for the hack however measures should be taken to protect your customers,2
9997,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work and the owner refused to give us another room,2
9998,we got there and our room was not cleaned on our,2
9999,i requested a king size bed and was told there was nothing they could do,2
