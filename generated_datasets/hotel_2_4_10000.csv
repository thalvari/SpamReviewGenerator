0,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
1,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
3,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
4,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
5,the online pictures were deceiving but the location was great but when i arrived it was hard to get the water hot,2
6,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
7,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
8,the hotel really needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff were no good,2
9,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
10,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
11,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
12,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
13,i took my mother there last week and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
14,i will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
15,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us one,2
16,overall the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
17,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff,2
18,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was very apologetic and immediately changed the sheets for us,2
19,there was no phone in the room was awful where it existed,2
20,during check out the clerk was sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
21,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
22,for the price we paid to stay at this hotel if you are looking to have a couple drinks without messing with the downtown crowd,2
23,our room looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s then this is the place for you,2
24,the tile in the shower toilet area were really dirty and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
25,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
26,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
27,our toilet stopped working in the middle of july is kind of important,2
28,staff was nice and the staff was great no complaints there at all,2
29,the literature in the room says if we don't have a problem with roaches,2
30,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
31,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
32,we have to ask for everything in the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
33,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
34,we were here for less than 12 hours but i would not recommend or stay here ever again,2
35,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
36,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
37,phones in the room did not have a good experience,2
38,there was a long line to get into the lobby due to construction,2
39,upon checking in the front desk person about it,2
40,i think the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the lobby area,2
41,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have any,2
42,i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
43,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise,2
44,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price i was satisfied however,2
45,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had a reservation for a early check in as we were on our way out,2
46,it was close to an event we were going to fill them or not,2
47,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
48,the room was okay but the hotel is in need of a remodel,2
49,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a comfort inn suites,2
50,the breakfast room was visited by one of the most inequiped and dirty places i've visited,2
51,the room was decent for the price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
52,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't expect to get blown away but i did expect more,2
53,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the supplies were in our room and we had to walk down a total of 3 times,2
54,the wifi didn't work in second room,2
55,we ordered towels early in the morning and it was very hot,2
56,when we called the front desk were i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
57,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
58,i would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was a non-smoking room,2
59,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
60,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
61,the same shower cubicle on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
62,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been a better experience,2
63,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
64,the in-room safe was locked so you can't even cool down after a long day,2
65,we were put in the ac didn't get very cold,2
66,at least the location is very convenient to the marathon area,2
67,the hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
68,didn't know we had to pay 10 to park in the back,2
69,was not impressed with the condition of the hotel was drab,2
70,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
71,expedia gets it wrong all the time and then they wanted to argue with me and then they said it was the surrounding restaurants,2
72,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
73,i would not stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
74,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
75,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
76,i stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
77,i booked this hotel because it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
78,i was told i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
79,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
80,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
81,i was moved to this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
82,bathroom was dirty and the room was clean but in need of updates,2
83,no wonder the girl at the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
84,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
85,rooms need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
86,the carpet in our room had been there,2
87,when we got to the room it was a disaster,2
88,took a shower walked on the floor and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room,2
89,when we booked this room we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
90,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't smell clean,2
91,budge was right but condition of the hotel in the morning,2
92,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
93,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
94,upon checking the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
95,we probably wont be staying here again,2
96,from the time you check in the staff is rude there were no amenities in the room,2
97,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
98,this time the room was not the best the owners were friendly,2
99,maybe if the hotel room was dirty and smelled like cat pee,2
100,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
101,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
102,the motel although the room was clean that's the best i can say about the hotel,2
103,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
104,after using another facility for a couple of hours but when i left there were only 3 small drawers,2
105,i found that our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
106,locals renting rooms did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
107,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
108,traveling alone and needed room for one night and this was through,2
109,this may have been due to the color of the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip,2
110,i would say this hotel was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
111,so on top of it trash was on the floor when we got there the room had a couple fruit flies,2
112,but when we got there we were given the one room outside of the actual hotel 116,2
113,i was told i would have to pay 4,2
114,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
115,when two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
116,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
117,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
118,somewhat outdated and the staff was great however the room was a bit rough,2
119,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
120,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
121,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
122,the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
123,all in all i was very disappointed that the wifi did not work well so we couldn't even really use it,2
124,the hotel room was more clean it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets,2
125,had to take a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
126,the room did not work room layout was not the same as advertised and you'll be charged an arm and a leg,2
127,only good thing about this hotel is the the front desk staff are the highlight of the stay,2
128,the door going into the wing of the hotel and the rooms smell,2
129,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bathroom floor was sticky and the chairs were dirty,2
130,the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
131,under construction had to turn off the one in the room is old with a rotten wood smell,2
132,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for weeks on end,2
133,we called early in the day so even,2
134,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend anyone to stay there,2
135,when talking to the front desk for one room,2
136,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
137,i went back to the front desk and request it,2
138,when i pulled into the parking lot right outside our window during the wee hours of the morning after a night out,2
139,plastic egg patties we were in the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working,2
140,bob the manager didn't want to find another place,2
141,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to sort out,2
142,good for simply having a place to sleep a few hours,2
143,the first room we were in the a c was not turned on and warm,2
144,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia he could not discount or comp me,2
145,the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
146,however the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
147,the hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
148,they are renovating this hotel when we were there in the middle of the night to change rooms,2
149,there was definitely a smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
150,the rug in our room was very nice,2
151,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
152,stayed here last year and it was a nice quiet stay,2
153,room was very small the room was a little bigger than the king size bed is really just two singles pushed together,2
154,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star,2
155,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
156,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
157,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
158,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't even stomach to stay a night,2
159,the were so bad it was hard to get the water hot,2
160,i would never stay at this location again,2
161,the room was clean but hallways had a horrible smell and floors were damp,2
162,the gal at the front desk we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get service,2
163,elevator was broke was told it would be half an hour,2
164,the check in staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
165,although clean i will not stay here again,2
166,expedia people were not very helpful when i tried to get another room i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
167,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
168,location was nice to be within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
169,the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have the room configuration that we had booked available,2
170,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
171,they refused to refund me for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
172,it was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
173,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk were pleasant and friendly,2
174,checkout both times the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
175,the air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
176,when we entered the lobby to check out the pool it was so dirty and the bathroom smells like sweat,2
177,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not a patio just a creepy window to look at unknown children,2
178,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
179,took some time to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
180,a dog did his business in the elevator and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the shower,2
181,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
182,as soon as we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
183,we had a room with a private bath,2
184,web site only said pool was closed for the whole stay,2
185,there was black mold in the bathroom in the shower and the rest of the staff were no good,2
186,it also needed better cleaning and the phone didn't work at all and in the living room only,2
187,breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
188,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
189,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to get the room i asked for,2
190,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
191,the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
192,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
193,the room was clean that's the best i can say is that we were extremely disappointed,2
194,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
195,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
196,the second room was a bit run down and dated,2
197,i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
198,we will never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
199,there was a rug in front of the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
200,went back up to the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
201,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't find the shirt which means that one of the maids stole it,2
202,staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was more of a convenience stop as opposed to a destination stop,2
203,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
204,had to check out after the first day i cam back from the beach to find out that the water pressure was good,2
205,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
206,i booked a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
207,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
208,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
209,when i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
210,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
211,best thing that i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
212,the first room was in bad need of updating,2
213,bob the manager didn't want to find another place,2
214,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
215,second smaller issue we were in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
216,room was in good condition the bed was very hard my window was over the hotel entrance so i changed hotels,2
217,nothing at all special about the hotel itself bed was comfortable enough again for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
218,tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a non-chain locally owned hotel,2
219,after that on our way to texas and the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
220,i called front desk because i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
221,called to complain about the air the room was very small and not clean,2
222,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get the water hot,2
223,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
224,the king size bed that was super hard,2
225,room is cute but it would have been a better experience,2
226,if all you need is a place to stay where we felt safe,2
227,great location to everything and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
228,well when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
229,i booked this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
230,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep,2
231,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
232,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
233,the appeal for this hotel over others was that it had an indoor pool and hot tub is nice,2
234,big gap underneath room door easily could see people going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a handicap room,2
235,i think this will be the first and last time i will stay here,2
236,this of course is not necessarily the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
237,there was one towel in the bathroom and for some reason the maint man wasn't around the next day,2
238,but the breakfast spread was good but the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
239,first of all i booked this room for the night and that they were no more rooms available,2
240,it did not show that it was an old man smell,2
241,next day by the time we got back,2
242,i realized that the next day and i didn't get the ocean view room that i wanted which i was upset,2
243,to report that they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
244,they apologized and said it would be refunded she said 7-10 days,2
245,overall next time i would definitely not stay there again on my next trip in two years,2
246,first impression of the room when we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
247,most best westerns i've stayed in dozens of hotels,2
248,i'm not hard to please but the second i walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
249,front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in need of a remodel,2
250,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
251,if i had known they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
252,very noisy and room smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
253,tv wasn't working and we actually had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
254,the pillows definately needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
255,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
256,about 8:00 pm still no bed so we again asked the front desk if we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
257,could hear tv all night in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
258,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
259,the hotel room was dirty and the room was relatively large and clean,2
260,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache the entire time i was there,2
261,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
262,about the only nice thing i can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
263,this was only a place to stay where we felt safe,2
264,we told them again and they said they would check into it but it did not change,2
265,let me add if you are on vacation and want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
266,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
267,i realized that the next day and i didn't get any wifi at all,2
268,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use hotels again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
269,when you close the door to the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
270,i was surprised at the condition of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
271,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but would not recommend it ever stay there again,2
272,but if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
273,the air conditioning in the room and they said they would send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
274,older hotel but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair,2
275,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk at midnight to complain,2
276,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
277,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
278,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
279,no wonder the girl at the front desk and,2
280,the next morning the lady at reception told me they had parking for trucks with trailers but it was in the nicest area of town,2
281,didn't know we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
282,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
283,i have to go to the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
284,i reserved a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
285,the room was overall clean and the bed was so uncomfortable,2
286,we were very disappointed as the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
287,i chose this hotel because it was close to the port,2
288,not a pleasant experience kinda place you don't want to spend a lot of money,2
289,we inquired how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know and didn't have access to that information,2
290,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
291,wi-fi is really good and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
292,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
293,when i went to check out the office was locked and i had to use three of them just to get a decent shower in,2
294,when i booked to a non-smoking room but we were given a room on the first floor,2
295,most of the rooms are nothing like what is shown in the pictures,2
296,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in early and the manager told us check in wasn't until 2:00,2
297,on check-in and subsequently all of the country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
298,glad we only stayed for a few hours for maintenance,2
299,also the indoor pool was closed for the whole stay,2
300,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't even get in the pool it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
301,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but would not recommend for long term visits,2
302,then they put us in another room which didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
303,the people at that hotel were really nice but the staff at the only hotel and restaurant would be more accommodating,2
304,only one of two hotels in the middle of holland mi,2
305,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
306,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were old and not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
307,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
308,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
309,the front staff was pleasant with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to relax,2
310,however room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to get the room down to live-able,2
311,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
312,we checked in late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
313,this was only a place to stay where we felt safe,2
314,however the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
315,sadly we paid top dollar for a room with a shower i am disabled and need a tub,2
316,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
317,i was moved to this hotel because of their private beach area,2
318,i chose this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
319,not at all worth the cost of the hotel this was concerning,2
320,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
321,when he entered the original room the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
322,it is a safe place to lay your head and for the price it should have been way better,2
323,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
324,it started with the phone in the room was stained and dirty,2
325,also on the first night when i returned to the room hours later it was not provided,2
326,staff friendly but all seemed to be in a hostel where u have to share bathrooms u expect,2
327,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
328,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
329,when checking in we asked for a non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
330,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
331,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
332,the staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
333,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had been booked to someone else as well,2
334,the a c was still not repaired and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
335,the screen door to the parking lot was full sorry,2
336,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
337,no wonder the girl at the front desk was nice she said she would let maintence know,2
338,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the shower was dirty,2
339,there was a cigarette burn hole in the top blanket of the bed i immediately went to front desk received another room,2
340,however one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
341,well when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
342,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
343,the good news is that the hotel is clean but to noisy for me and the only thing i can say about the hotel,2
344,i called the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
345,while i stayed at this hotel 3 times,2
346,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
347,it is situated right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
348,it started with the phone in the room was a huge disappointment,2
349,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was a joke,2
350,i booked the room in a very bad area of town,2
351,this time the room was not that clean and the room did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
352,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
353,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2

355,at that point i pointed out that hotels is the only reason we booked a hotel for a get away,2
356,hotel itself was okay but the free breakfast was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
357,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
358,it was a place to lay my head after a long day in anaheim then this place is great,2
359,don't think i would stay here again,2
360,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
361,the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
362,i was disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
363,the condition of the room had expired drinks,2
364,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
365,when we asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to know what she was doing,2
366,we had an early adventure they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
367,we had a great view of orange county choppers from the parking lot lit up our room all night even through the curtain,2
368,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
369,the hotel seemed very dated and and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
370,the door to our room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2

378,we have stayed here twice now and both times there was a hand written no vacancy sign taped to the window,2
379,second room was a bit musty smelling,2
380,there are maybe 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
381,the online reservation was for a room that was not close to the beaches either,2
382,the age of this hotel is below acceptable,2
383,the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there,2
384,i had a suite which was large and quiet but the rooms are very small the heat didn't work in second room,2
385,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2

387,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
388,we checked into the hotel the lobby was nice and the kitchen clean,2
389,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
390,for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
391,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
392,the gym was probably one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,2
393,there is a sign on the door as non smoking,2
394,the air conditioner didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
395,the second room we were put in the ac didn't get very cold,2
396,we told them again and they said they would check into it but it did not change,2
397,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
398,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
399,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
400,overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot,2
401,most of the time we had to call housekeeping to clean room,2
402,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
403,the only thing i really liked about this hotel was the decor and breakfast other then that i was disappointed,2
404,the motel is very old and very stained,2
405,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2

407,after using another facility for a couple of hours but when i left there were only 3 people,2
408,there was mold everywhere and one of the rooms i was placed in looked like something out of a horror movie,2
409,family coming for vacation i would not recommend this hotel until renovations take place,2
410,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation and confirmed the price but,2
411,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
412,also room was listed as smoking and when i checked out and they seemed very concerned,2
413,it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
414,the room had a neat look the staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was a problem,2
415,pools were nice and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
416,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
417,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
418,i also asked for a room on the first floor,2
419,i think the reason the lighting is so dim is so you don't have to drag my with me,2
420,staff friendly but all seemed to be in a hostel where u have to share bathrooms u expect,2
421,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned by the maids,2
422,the bathroom had hair on the floor and the room smelled like cigarette smoke even though our non smoking room was on the small side,2

424,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2

426,we soon found out that our room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain front and center,2
427,the room is not the same as explained by hotels,2
428,also the staff were very helpful and friendly,2

431,our view out the window was of the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
432,i had a brief overnight stay here on the way back to the hotel on your own,2

439,we were disappointed that we didn't have a microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
440,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the type of room that we booked available,2
441,when we booked we thought it was an abandoned building,2
442,the only thing that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't use it,2
443,it wasn't at all happy with the condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
444,when we entered the lobby to check out the pool and hot tub to find it was empty,2
445,the swimming pool was very dirty and i found it hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been flushed,2
446,the hotel was booked and we were on the ground floor,2
447,no towels in the room when we checked in and kids couldn't use it,2
448,the carpet in the hall and the smoking on the other on the third floor so was not about to personally go to the desk,2
449,the room was clean but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
450,first impression of the room when we arrived and upon departure,2
451,she treated my husband and i stayed here so that we could sleep well,2
452,the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
453,we had a non-smoking room that smelled like cheech and chong died in it,2
454,our room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom,2

463,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
464,last visited we left behind a sweater and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
465,the room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
466,first the room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay at a dt again,2
467,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
468,pool closed early the night we checked in and went to our room,2
469,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
470,the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner was noisy even on low,2
471,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
472,after returning to our room we were met with an oh,2

474,i needed a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel last week and they are going through renovations,2

479,we checked in found that the room was extremely over dated,2
480,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and no one was available to remedy this situation,2
481,when i called the hotel to ask about it they were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
482,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety,2
483,failed to tell us the heater needed plugged in so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
484,breakfast room way too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
485,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
486,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
487,by the time we checked it we also had to ask for extra towels each night,2
488,upon arrival we asked the front desk and request more,2
489,please do not stay at this location again,2
490,oh we know it is a smoking room but when i checked in several things happened,2
491,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
492,our non-smoking room that smelled like cheech and chong died in it,2
493,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
494,could hear tv all night in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
495,at least there was a second sink in the room i was given had no desk,2
496,didn't know we had to pay for one night for a wedding,2
497,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not,2

499,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the shower,2
500,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't work and pool was green and dirty,2
501,overall if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day i sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better,2
502,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to get towels,2
503,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
504,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk were pleasant and friendly,2
505,great location to everything and the staff were quite non-responsive,2

508,the rate was 50 for our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
509,the tv wasn't even plugged in we had to figure out how to use the door um i know how to use a door,2

511,the check-in staff was friendly and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
512,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and focus on that,2
513,we inquired how long it would be and they told us it was walking distance to santa barbara pier,2
514,we did make management at the front desk she wasn't too concerned,2
515,this hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
516,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
517,called to complain about the air the room was very small the room was a huge disappointment,2
518,i stayed in berkeley 40 just for one day and we did not ask for that,2
519,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
520,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
521,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and filthy with,2
522,room was not clean staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
523,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
524,they resorted to using a paper check in so that i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
525,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
526,our room was supposed to be a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
527,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2

534,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
535,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
536,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
537,it was clean and the supplies were in our room and in the hallways,2
538,she informed us that our room had a terrible odor and floors were dirty and stained,2
539,pool was super tiny but the hot tub was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
540,i'd rather pay a little more and stay at best western next door which i highly recommend,2
541,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
542,please do not stay at this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
543,and when we went to check-out the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
544,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room the entire time we were there even though i told them several times,2
545,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
546,was forced to stay because it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
547,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
548,we selected the hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
549,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
550,you could hear everyone around you as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
551,our room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have the information required,2
552,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
553,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and neither was the pool,2

555,and the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
556,the staff and location was perfect but the room was generally in bad shape,2
557,overall the room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
558,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
559,they told me it'd be returned if i didn't have to try again with the machine,2
560,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one partially used roll of toilet paper,2
561,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
562,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
563,sliding doors in our room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are crazy comfortable,2

565,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
566,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
567,the hot tub on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
568,the best i can say about the hotel,2

570,it was just a place to sleep this one will do,2
571,i asked for a king bed room,2
572,it just did not feel very can and up to date but the rooms are very sub-par,2
573,office was closed when we got back to our room upset,2
574,our room had direct access to the pool was not heated and the hot tub was not in use,2
575,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
576,he's stayed at this hotel several times over the years,2
577,and that the hot tub was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
578,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
579,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2

594,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
595,room was clean and the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
596,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
597,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
598,i guess you get what you pay for a place to crash,2

600,get a room with a view of the arch,2
601,really for 135 a night needless to say i am never going to stay there again,2

607,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
608,next day by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
609,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
610,as soon as we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
611,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
612,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
613,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid the level was not there,2
614,the real problem however was the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
615,front desk staff somewhat aloof initially sent us to a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise,2
616,we didn't get much sleep at all between that and the sound of the side door next to our room opening and closing,2
617,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but everything was old and or not very well kept,2

625,the room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures on the internet the hotel looks decent for the price,2
626,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
627,the phone in the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
628,hotel was not very clean and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
629,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a small amount of fried rice on the bed spread,2
630,i discovered this in the first room they assigned me was an upgrade,2
631,got to the hotel around 3:45 and was offered a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
632,had driven all day and wanted a place to sleep and a quick shower i guess for the price this hotel is way to expensive,2
633,the visit was for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not,2
634,she stood in front of the door and the toilet leaked,2
635,we called early in the day so even,2
636,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
637,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not give it more than 2,2
638,tried to call downstairs and the phone did not work and nautilus weight machine,2
639,we felt like we were in a king bed smoking,2
640,our biggest complaint was that we did not have the problem,2
641,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was not clean at all,2
642,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
643,location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
644,front desk was very sweet but the room wasn't really that clean,2
645,the water stunk and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
646,didn't like the fact that the front desk is 100,2
647,took all night to warm up even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
648,although the rooms were clean enough but just not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
649,we asked for a king bed and was told there was not one mccamlyplaza amenities,2
650,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
651,finally got a room in the same building,2
652,since my room was next to the door and the room was in desperate,2
653,overall we did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
654,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
655,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
656,the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk she wasn't too concerned,2
657,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
658,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe,2
659,there was only one clerk at the front desk i called the hotel a week later they still hadn't authorized the refund,2
660,got what i paid for next time ill spend few more bucks for a more clean room,2
661,the staff was pleasant at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
662,i had decided to give it another try,2
663,the room was much cheaper upon check out than when i booked it there was gross stuff on my pillow the room was very clean,2
664,maybe if the hotel room was small and cramped old rough neighborhood,2
665,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
666,we called early in the day so even,2
667,this time the room smelled of smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
668,the second room didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
669,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds and there was a lot more noise from the tenants,2
670,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
671,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
672,thankfully we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
673,wanted a non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking hotel,2
674,walls were paper thin we could hear the maids earlier in the day,2
675,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
676,considering the price the hotel would have been prepared,2
677,desk clerk was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
678,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
679,a young gentleman named devin was very helpful for me the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
680,one word awful and the pool was out of service,2
681,we had to sleep with no covers because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
682,i just hate that i had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet,2
683,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was worn out and used,2
684,given the low price point i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
685,there is no one at the front desk and told them of the issues,2
686,i stayed at the best western next door,2
687,in the bathroom of the first room we got had an awful smell,2
688,it was awful and our room smelled a little weird,2
689,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
690,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
691,even though we stayed in a non-smoking room that smelled like smoke,2
692,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
693,the clerk informed us that our room had been there,2
694,when we arrived there was a large stain on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
695,they said we couldn't use that,2
696,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
697,i chose this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is close to highway,2
698,they said we couldn't use that,2
699,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
700,it's a decent price for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
701,unexpected layover required a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel several times for softball tournaments,2
702,the rug in our room was very nice,2
703,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
704,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to stay for weeks on end,2
705,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
706,i got back very late and i did sleep for a couple of years we returned to the hampton inn,2
707,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room was ready,2
708,however we were not impressed with the condition of the room for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
709,we were very disappointed in this room for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
710,wasn't able to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
711,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
712,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was acceptable and as described,2
713,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
714,then they put us in a room with no difference,2
715,will not stay at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone,2
716,i was with my kids and when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
717,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk for a west facing room but were told that there,2
718,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
719,kind of like walmart if you don't mind parking on the street,2
720,i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
721,just our luck the late guests made over a dozen trips in and out of this house all night at every hour,2
722,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
723,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
724,outdated hotel and long lines to check in and other needs,2
725,we had a room on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
726,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet and prepare for your socks to look like you were walking outside,2
727,the only thing i really liked about this hotel was the decor and breakfast other then that i was disappointed,2
728,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
729,i was disappointed in the size of the room was much cheaper upon check out than when i booked it,2
730,price was the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
731,in the middle of october for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
732,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
733,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't expect to get blown away but i did expect more,2
734,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
735,i have stayed at elk springs resort several times over the years because of it's convenience and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
736,no amenities were in the room with you,2
737,the room was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
738,make you go to the lobby to ask for it to be this bad,2
739,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
740,somewhat outdated and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
741,the girl at the front desk were friendly,2
742,there were ants all over the bathroom floor,2
743,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
744,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
745,we should have realized because we could hear the room next door through the walls,2
746,it stated that it was a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
747,we will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
748,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and it didn't look like blood spots,2
749,will not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
750,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
751,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
752,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was acceptable and as described,2
753,no towels in the room when i come to these types of places to house their people,2
754,this particular candlewood i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
755,hotel staff was friendly and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner in the tub dispenser,2
756,in the early morning i was trying to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
757,room got up to 83 before i went to the lobby with my computer to get some work done,2
758,looks better with the online pics needs to be updated just like the rest of the room was great,2
759,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
760,we barely got a wink of sleep we were so disgusted and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
761,the robot on the other end of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
762,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
763,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
764,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
765,i will use this hotel again if i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
766,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
767,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
768,well when we arrived at the hotel first so i did not look,2
769,this place is in need of a lot of attention,2
770,there was food in it still and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
771,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the stairs and halls were dirty,2
772,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up,2
773,we told staff and they said they forgot to fix it,2
774,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
775,positives sleeper sofa in the room was awful where it existed,2
776,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
777,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
778,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
779,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
780,the gentleman who was at the front desk were pleasant and friendly,2
781,i stayed at the quality inn and it is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for what you get,2
782,in general the only good thing i can say is that it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
783,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was very sweet but the room was clean,2
784,at least it didn't look like it would help much,2
785,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
786,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower there's not much to rave about,2
787,there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom,2
788,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
789,our room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have,2
790,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
791,the management did not notify the guests of the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
792,they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
793,was disappointed to see that the pool wasn't any better,2
794,didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
795,now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was good,2
796,it was not the worst place we could have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
797,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
798,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
799,first of all i booked this room for the night and thought we'd try it,2
800,there was food in the floor when i got to the motel it looked sketchy from first sight,2
801,turns out this is not a business hotel,2
802,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
803,staff were nice and friendly but the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one,2
804,i call the front desk and request more,2
805,00 for my room for one night on our way to the room,2
806,not sure what the other rooms were like but i had a smoking room and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes,2
807,the motel is tidy and the room was relatively large and clean,2
808,hotel itself was okay but the hotel itself is lovely,2
809,location is okay but the hotel is in need of a major power wash,2
810,i didn't like that the room had a musky moldy smell the entire time and the water pressure was good,2
811,other than that the rooms are old and creepy looking,2
812,the staff for the most part was great,2
813,for basically a hundred bucks a night that i spent here next time i'm going to use this as a hotel of last resort,2
814,at 3:15 am the fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am,2
815,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to be moving,2
816,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo,2
817,a place to sleep coming in late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute booking,2
818,i do have an appreciation for security however at the cost of the the normal hotels we stay at were double the normal cost,2
819,hotels said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the lobby to ask for it to be cleaned up,2
820,she informed us that our room has broken furniture,2
821,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
822,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
823,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
824,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
825,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
826,the first room we were in the area for less money,2
827,juice machine broken had to ask for towels they did not have the room that someone booked over a month ago,2
828,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
829,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
830,the general condition of the hotel and the rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
831,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
832,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
833,i suppose this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
834,our room was dark and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
835,it is in desperate need of an update,2
836,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
837,the tv was very old and very run down,2
838,but i was in the elevator and there was a lot of dust,2
839,they said there would be a pleasant atmosphere,2
840,there was mold everywhere and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
841,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was a bit musty,2
842,the elevator did not work properly and the pool was closed,2
843,the motel room door was underneath a stairwell around a corner so it did not have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
844,told receptionist about it and they didn't even have a lid,2
845,room 308 314 are the best in the world but it wasn't the greatest,2
846,i immediately called the front desk and told them about this so i didn't just fall off the turnip truck,2
847,i mentioned a discount and the front desk was not especially helpful,2
848,but we won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
849,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and not much is being done to keep it up,2
850,one night before our trip to gatlinburg and one night on our way to texas and the room was relatively large and clean,2
851,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
852,i mentioned a discount and the front desk and complained and asked if we could park,2
853,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days although is in a very convenient location,2
854,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
855,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
856,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
857,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a no cancellation reservation,2
858,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
859,our room wasn't serviced the first day the bed wasn't very comfortable felt the springs,2
860,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
861,the next day i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
862,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
863,we were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
864,bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
865,guess they were not happy with our stay,2
866,found the room to be mildly comfortable and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
867,then the night they left the fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am,2
868,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here unless you're desperate,2
869,for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't necessary,2
870,the distance was a big problem and i feel the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
871,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk i called the hotel from my phone,2
872,the problem with the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
873,the swimming pool was very dirty and i found it hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been updated since 1985,2
874,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
875,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
876,if you just need a place to sleep for the night,2
877,it had a dingy smell and was very old and moldy plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool,2
878,the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
879,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't busy when i was there,2
880,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't have a room with two queen beds,2
881,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
882,had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
883,i was told i couldn't have been more wrong,2
884,for what we paid for our night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
885,walls were filthy we requested a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
886,almost gagged when we open the door to the bed room is a louvered,2
887,i guess we got what we paid for our night at this hotel because it looked nice but specifically for the hot tub,2
888,i use marriott a lot this is the first time i have to say was very clean,2
889,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
890,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
891,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
892,requested refrigerator and microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
893,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the elevator and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
894,i know santa barbara is expensive but for the price and if you are staying 1-2 nights,2
895,the sound women at the front desk at all times,2
896,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
897,the walls are super thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room had expired drinks,2
898,other parts of the hotel did not have a part,2
899,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
900,the gym had a treadmill that did not work and we had to take whatever was available on a holiday weekend,2
901,took all night to warm up even though it was still supposed to be open,2
902,water was leaking through the roof in a section of the building so had to go to a concert at the bbt center,2
903,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
904,second time i have stayed at this hotel several times over the years and never cleaned,2
905,i didn't like that the room had a gas smell to me that never went away,2
906,the only good thing about the hotel is the location but still does not justify their price point and condition,2
907,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
908,the staff and location was perfect but the room was overpriced for the quality of the t,2
909,staff was nice nice location but the room was clean and comfortable was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities,2
910,the first room we were in the area for less money,2
911,budge was right but condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
912,the room was comfortable which was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
913,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
914,a great place to stay for one night,2
915,later i asked the front desk if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage,2
916,will be calling america's best value inn and i've stayed in la,2
917,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was in a room with no difference,2
918,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
919,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room and there was hair in the tub and on the floor,2
920,the house keep called in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
921,we could hear the guests in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
922,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
923,front desk worker was really rude when we checked in later we were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning,2
924,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
925,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
926,the location was great but when i arrived it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains,2
927,we had to ask for towels they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
928,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
929,next time i'm in town for business i work late and get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
930,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that it is great compared to a motel 6,2
931,on the shower curtain and there was a very large dead roach in the middle of the floor,2
932,but the place is so small that it's not really a resort hotel like you expect,2
933,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
934,i was very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
935,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
936,the sun didn't shine brightly when we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
937,hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the lake with lakeview rooms but the service is horrible,2
938,i was excited to stay at this hotel if you are a smoker you will love have no issues with the hotel,2
939,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
940,they put us in a new room on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
941,heat didn't work the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
942,my non smoking room smelled like smoke even though our non smoking room was on the small side,2
943,when we asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to understand me,2
944,one of the four rooms on the third floor so ask byron for help with your luggage,2
945,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
946,won't stay at this hotel if you are a senior,2
947,we were able to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
948,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
949,we were driving late at night and needed a place to stay for the weekend of my boyfriends graduation which was memorial day weekend,2
950,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for 2 hours for housekeeping,2
951,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
952,we asked for an immediate move to another room and it was not very clean,2
953,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
954,we stayed two nights and the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
955,failed to tell us the tv was broken and that we had to put dryer sheets in the ac vents because it smelled so bad,2
956,almost turned around when we got to the room it was a disaster,2
957,there was mold everywhere and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
958,the room was decent and the breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly and helpful though,2
959,the property was quiet at night for the protection of the staff,2
960,bed was comfortable staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock,2
961,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
962,but between the kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
963,but the room was not at all what i expected,2
964,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is quite run down and in need of significant upgrades,2
965,this seems to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
966,plumbing drains in room did not work room layout was not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there,2
967,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
968,this could be a great place to stay for one night,2
969,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to call to get the front desk to get them,2
970,hair dryer cord broken it worked but seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chairs watching tv,2
971,called to front desk and found that the individual in charge for the night was pretty good and the room was relatively large and clean,2
972,the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the carpet in the room was more than filthy,2
973,way too much for what you get overall,2
974,when we entered through the back of the vending machine shed,2
975,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
976,the tv wasn't working and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning,2
977,whilst we my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
978,you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
979,also the staff were very helpful and friendly,2
980,the price for the night was pretty good and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
981,i thought it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
982,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
983,when i checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
984,breakfast was the worst i have stayed at,2
985,my sister brother-in-law didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
986,breakfast was good as well as the people we were visiting,2
987,the me t day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
988,well i thought cockroaches in the room was stained and dirty,2
989,i would consider going back there if it was a very quiet location with great views,2
990,the shower head was falling out of the ceiling in the pool room,2
991,the front desk clerk reassured me the room was not serviced or cleaned for the 2nd day of our stay,2
992,there was mold everywhere and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
993,their ignorance ruined what could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
994,one of those days that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there and the fire alarm went off,2
995,later i asked if we had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
996,the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
997,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the water was cold in the shower,2
998,for 90 a night the room was small and not very comfortable,2
999,first of all i booked this room for the price i was satisfied however,2
1000,purchased a double queen room with a view of the kiddy pool,2
1001,i had to call to get the front desk to change rooms and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
1002,one afternoon we asked for a rollaway they said they didn't have my phone i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
1003,holiday inn has become one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
1004,i told the staff when i checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
1005,to start off with good the front desk staff were not the friendliest,2
1006,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
1007,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
1008,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of order,2
1009,the room was clean but needs to be updated through out hotel is old and in need of an overhaul,2
1010,i'm never going to stay there again,2
1011,the first room i was placed in had a heating unit that did not work and when asked to be moved to a,2
1012,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
1013,only food i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
1014,upon checking the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
1015,was i supprised when i checked in several things happened,2
1016,despite keeping my expectations low i was very disappointed that the pool was not available for use even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
1017,we chose this hotel was because it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the people we were visiting,2
1018,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
1019,staff were rude when we asked for a different room,2
1020,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room,2
1021,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was terrible,2
1022,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was over flowing for 2 days,2
1023,the staff for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
1024,we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
1025,the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and mold ceiling was split open due to roof leak,2
1026,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping a low battery beep,2
1027,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
1028,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
1029,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
1030,was not impressed with the condition of the room had expired drinks,2
1031,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
1032,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we wanted to see,2
1033,will not stay here again even though it seems to be the attitude in maintaining this hotel,2
1034,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff when we checked in left you speechless,2
1035,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a 4 inch step making entry with a power wheelchair difficutl,2
1036,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every person walking by at 1 am 2 am 3 am,2
1037,the hook fell off the back of the hotel would have given us for the room,2
1038,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
1039,room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
1040,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
1041,only positive thing was that the room was nice and it was very loud,2
1042,the motel room door was underneath a stairwell around a corner so it did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
1043,pros front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
1044,elevator was broke was told it would be under my door,2
1045,well when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
1046,it was not at all clean the air conditioner did not make the bedroom cold,2
1047,stayed here a year ago and i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2

1049,after that on our way to dinner and they said they would put us in another room,2
1050,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
1051,however the desk attendant was very pleasant and gave me a bottle of water so i didn't get any sleep,2
1052,the good news is that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2
1053,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the curtains-the carpet was wet,2
1054,not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
1055,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
1056,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
1057,the room did not have a hair dryer,2
1058,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room i have confirmation of that when i got into my room,2
1059,price was the best thing about the hotel is the location but still does not justify their price point and condition,2
1060,we told staff and they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
1061,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
1062,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay an additional 40,2

1064,then in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
1065,our toilet overflowed also and it took awhile for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
1066,there was one person working at the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
1067,the bed was comfortable and the room was still to hot,2
1068,the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
1069,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
1070,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view of morro rock and within walking distance to,2
1071,the room had a neat look the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like marijuana,2
1072,hotels said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the front desk and told them of the issues,2
1073,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
1074,i booked prior to arriving and requested a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
1075,i checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
1076,when we got back to the room for the night,2
1077,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
1078,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to stay in one with two double beds like we asked for,2
1079,looked under the mattress only to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
1080,this motel was not as clean as other hampton inns,2
1081,when we again asked for a rollaway they said they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
1082,room was plenty clean but did have a bit of a hodge-podge of decor,2
1083,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
1084,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
1085,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
1086,the room was decent and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
1087,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
1088,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
1089,elevator was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
1090,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
1091,and the biggest annoyance was there was no water in the room and didn't see any but the bites continued,2
1092,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
1093,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
1094,the breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
1095,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
1096,the a c was not turned on and warm,2
1097,walls were paper thin we could hear the room next door below,2
1098,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a room to sleep the room was quite small,2
1099,the location of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1100,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
1101,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the carpet while clean was worn the bathroom faucet leaked,2
1102,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
1103,i was really upset when i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
1104,the only positive thing i can say about the hotel,2
1105,it was not worth the price we paid,2
1106,we survived the night but i won't stay here again,2
1107,there was food in it still and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
1108,i was really disappointed with the condition of the room had to go to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean,2
1109,it's a bit run down and drab,2
1110,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
1111,well when we arrived at the address we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
1112,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
1113,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
1114,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of the things we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
1115,stayed here for one night only and the the hotel was full so i could not keep food etc fresh chilled,2
1116,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
1117,the me t day the room was not a good deal,2
1118,the room was clean and staff was nice and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
1119,we stayed here for one night on our way back to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
1120,we told staff and they said they forgot to fix it,2
1121,no one was ever at the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
1122,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
1123,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
1124,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more and stay at best western next door which i highly recommend,2
1125,run down property and with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to relax,2
1126,front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
1127,the gal at the desk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
1128,front desk was very sweet but the room wasn't really that clean,2
1129,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
1130,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to the sawgrass mills mall,2
1131,somewhat outdated and the staff was great and friendly,2
1132,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i left we were charged a fee for smoking on the porch,2
1133,no one at the front desk were friendly,2
1134,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
1135,maybe if the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
1136,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
1137,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
1138,i asked for another type of room but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
1139,bob the manager didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
1140,i was told i couldn't have been more wrong,2
1141,but i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
1142,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
1143,i usually love country inn and suites but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
1144,great location to everything and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
1145,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
1146,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
1147,later i asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the car park when we arrived and upon departure,2
1148,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
1149,complementary breakfast was limited but the help was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
1150,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi worked well,2
1151,staff were nice and friendly but the property is old and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
1152,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
1153,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
1154,checkout both times the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
1155,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
1156,holiday inn has become one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this hotel,2
1157,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
1158,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
1159,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
1160,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
1161,the inside of the room a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and it wasn't family friendly,2
1162,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
1163,but the last time i stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very well kept,2
1164,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
1165,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
1166,this hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
1167,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2

1172,thank goodness that the room was very smellly i had to open my door for some air on the last day,2
1173,the me t day the room was not a good deal,2
1174,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
1175,the staff was friendly and the room was kind of gross,2
1176,at about 11:30 at night when i was there and the fire alarm went off at 2 am,2
1177,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
1178,upon checking the front desk person about it,2
1179,when i got in the room i was in and hot tub yet again remains out of service,2

1181,i felt like the room was not working no channel,2
1182,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
1183,this location is very dated and in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
1184,the indoor pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not recommend this hotel for this reason,2
1185,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
1186,breakfast area is under construction so it will be nice upon completion but we were not informed about the treacherous 20 min drive from gatlinburg,2
1187,and that the hot tub was not in order and we were offered a deal to stay there for bb,2
1188,they were very rude and i won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
1189,second problem the shower in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
1190,the common areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is really run down,2
1191,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
1192,the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
1193,there was nobody at the front desk was very polite,2
1194,when i went back to the front desk to complain about the air the room was very small,2
1195,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
1196,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
1197,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
1198,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2

1202,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
1203,we would not stay at this location again,2
1204,we had never stayed at an extended stay before but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
1205,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
1206,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was not anxious to be of service,2
1207,we were so tired in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
1208,yes they are under construction i i new i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
1209,our room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
1210,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2

1212,prior to staying at this hotel again unless it had,2
1213,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
1214,we were looking for a nice place,2

1216,positives sleeper sofa in the room was not helpful at all,2
1217,the first room was in bad need of repair,2
1218,weird part 1 was the second room didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
1219,the hot tub on the first night when i returned to the room there was an odor,2
1220,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
1221,if the management knew it was not going to be there besides to sleep it will do,2
1222,only one of two hotels in the middle of the night,2
1223,as i walked into the hallway and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
1224,they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
1225,i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
1226,folks running the front desk were i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
1227,the door going into the wing of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
1228,not horrible by any means our room was fairly quiet but i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
1229,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
1230,the tv wasn't working and we actually had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
1231,this could be a great place to stay for a night it's not bad,2

1237,i knew when i booked this hotel weeks in advance for a wrestling tournament were adequate at best,2
1238,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
1239,second room they moved us to a different room,2
1240,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
1241,we did get a different room or gave us a heater,2
1242,first problem was finding the front door the hotel is located in bad area,2
1243,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
1244,outdated hotel and long lines to check in and other needs,2
1245,bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
1246,when we arrived at the hotel first so i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
1247,it was run down dirty the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but they never fixed it,2
1248,took all night to warm up even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
1249,the second room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give me one,2
1250,when i got to my room i couldn't believe it,2
1251,the motel room door was underneath a stairwell around a corner so it did not have a choice since everything was prepaid,2
1252,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
1253,i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
1254,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
1255,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
1256,i figured that we would pay a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer,2
1257,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the bed was a wooden plank with a sheet thrown over it,2
1258,the heater in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be blood splatter i know like call the fbi,2
1259,i reported this to the desk and they gave us a new one,2
1260,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
1261,we wanted a king bed and was told there was not one mccamlyplaza amenities,2
1262,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
1263,the room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures on the website were obviously taken when everything,2
1264,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend or stay here ever again,2
1265,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
1266,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
1267,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
1268,however when i called the desk and they gave us a new one,2
1269,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
1270,when we arrived our first impression was that it is great compared to a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
1271,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be a motel where people live there not just stay overnight,2
1272,we were told we had two queen bed but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
1273,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
1274,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
1275,when i stay at a hotel i don't expect miracles for the price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
1276,however i noticed the patio window had not been cleaned and the corners looked like they had never been cleaned,2
1277,there were only 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
1278,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
1279,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
1280,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
1281,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
1282,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room that smelled like cheech and chong died in it,2
1283,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and near the convention center,2
1284,there was nobody at the front desk was not especially helpful,2
1285,the location of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1286,needed a hotel for one night and we are locals i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
1287,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
1288,glad we only stayed for a few hours for maintenance,2
1289,sorry but we will not be staying here anymore,2
1290,there seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
1291,to start off with good the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the carpet in the room was great,2
1292,when i got to my room i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a vent fan,2
1293,tried to call downstairs and the phone didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
1294,my concern was that it would be most convenient for me to park in the garage the first time,2
1295,it was very cold outside and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
1296,i asked for a receipt and was told it would be under renovation so that was not the major problem,2
1297,the wifi did not work the last morning the maid did not clean the bathroom well,2
1298,stay here if you have no alternative and just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
1299,the hotel was booked and we were on the second floor,2
1300,i have stayed at this hotel it was under remodeling and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
1301,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
1302,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly and the door to our room the pillows had no pillow cases,2
1303,when we arrived we had to wait n lobby awhile,2
1304,my second time staying there the location is great and with good expectations we stopped here again,2
1305,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
1306,then they put us in a room with no difference,2
1307,i was in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
1308,when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
1309,there was no contenental breakfast not that i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
1310,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
1311,the chair in the room had to go to other side just to get ice,2
1312,i chose this hotel because it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
1313,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
1314,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
1315,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was no breakfast left and it was not replenished,2
1316,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
1317,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
1318,the bedding was very old and very stained,2
1319,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
1320,also the staff were very helpful and friendly,2
1321,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
1322,the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
1323,we stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
1324,overall it was what i paid for next time ill spend few more bucks for a more clean room,2
1325,well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for,2
1326,the room was fine and the bed was so high i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
1327,the service was very slow and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
1328,i don't think i have ever seen in my life,2
1329,the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
1330,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in decades the carpet was so nasty,2
1331,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western downtown nashville on our way back from a trip to sc,2
1332,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
1333,the breakfast was great but the room was overpriced for the quality of the room,2
1334,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
1335,there was no iron in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
1336,when i pay for a hotel room that was so dirty,2
1337,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to stuff,2
1338,the rooms were not very clean and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
1339,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
1340,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
1341,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even have standard size pillows,2
1342,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
1343,i called the front desk and request more,2
1344,there was lipstick on one of the beds and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
1345,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
1346,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
1347,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
1348,walls are thin and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
1349,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
1350,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not clean,2
1351,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a kingsize but actually a twin with window cushion,2
1352,the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was not on site,2
1353,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
1354,beat up furniture in the room is incorrect,2
1355,we booked it following great reviews and the only thing that was good about my stay,2
1356,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
1357,when two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
1358,had to search for employee to get something to eat since there are plenty of other options,2
1359,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be under renovation so that was not the major problem,2
1360,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
1361,only only only plus for this hotel is the the front desk staff were friendly,2
1362,the doors need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
1363,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
1364,i finally called the front desk and she was,2
1365,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
1366,ok but don't think i got a good experience but too bad i was disappointed,2
1367,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
1368,the hotel room was dirty and the bathroom was clean but the beds are very uncomfortable and old,2
1369,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
1370,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
1371,when you close the door to the front desk of this,2
1372,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
1373,i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
1374,i was really upset when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
1375,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
1376,the location of the room i was told they did not have anymore,2
1377,the motel is very old and very stained,2
1378,the staff is helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
1379,bathmat was folded nicely on towel rack with a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
1380,they gave us a new room at midnight,2
1381,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
1382,thankfully our room did not have a handicap accessible parking spot,2
1383,our room wasn't serviced the first day the bed wasn't very comfortable felt the springs,2
1384,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no place to put our head after a christmas party,2
1385,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the room itself was partially updated but paint peeling in other areas,2
1386,both times the check-in staff was friendly and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
1387,had four people in our room and we had to ask for extra towels each night,2
1388,also the indoor pool was closed for the whole stay,2
1389,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not one of the better ones,2
1390,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
1391,check in was quick but when we went to the market to buy our own,2
1392,the outside is nice inside of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
1393,i chose this hotel because of the location the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
1394,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
1395,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
1396,there is no one at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
1397,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and the room did have a refrigerator and microwave,2
1398,traveling by myself i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger,2
1399,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
1400,i asked her if i was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
1401,the staff was great however the room was not a good deal,2
1402,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
1403,the front desk staff when we checked in left you speechless,2
1404,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
1405,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
1406,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
1407,the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
1408,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
1409,the gym was probably one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,2
1410,when we called the front desk and told them about this so i didn't expect much as this was a last minute booking,2
1411,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
1412,a c blew cold air but the room was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
1413,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
1414,the room was not very nice and the breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
1415,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a different room but the air still didn't seem cool enough,2
1416,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
1417,when we went to check-out the front desk is boxed with glass,2
1418,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but this hotel is not worth the money in my opinion,2
1419,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
1420,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and filthy with,2
1421,the room was not serviced or cleaned for the 2nd day and the housekeeper just let my husband in the room no frig,2
1422,the bear was not found and we know it wasn't changed because of the tea stain on the sheets,2
1423,the bathroom had to be the smallest i've ever seen in my life,2
1424,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
1425,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
1426,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
1427,we were not able to open the door to our room had a crack large enough to see through,2
1428,other than the odor the hotel and room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
1429,it was not the worst place we could have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
1430,last visited we left behind a sweater and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
1431,was forced to stay because it was the only room they offered us was an accessibility room right by the front door,2
1432,cigarette burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bed was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
1433,the staff was courteous and room was clean but the lobby was a bit run down,2
1434,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
1435,the motel is very old and very stained,2
1436,not even a note on the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
1437,small refrigerator and microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
1438,the good thing was the rooms were clean but just needed alot of updating,2
1439,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
1440,the room was adequately clean though the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
1441,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
1442,we were very disappointed we had to go to other side just to get ice,2
1443,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
1444,we felt safe in our room even though there was a line of 5 people deep waiting to check in and other needs,2
1445,when i booked to a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
1446,we soon discovered there was no way to air it out,2
1447,i reserved a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in room so they couldn't use it,2
1448,i expected to room to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
1449,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up,2
1450,almost turned around when we got to the room it was a disaster,2
1451,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
1452,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
1453,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
1454,i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we wanted to see,2
1455,the good thing was the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
1456,for basically a hundred bucks a night that i spent here next time i'm going to use this as a hotel of last resort,2
1457,thank goodness that the room was extremely over dated,2
1458,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
1459,the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
1460,we booked it because it was so warm,2
1461,turns out this is not a good response,2
1462,it was very cold outside and we couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to sleep in it,2
1463,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
1464,this hotel is much in need of a major power wash,2
1465,had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
1466,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
1467,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
1468,nonetheless bed was comfy and clean and we got a good night of sleep for a low price but this is not a bar,2
1469,even the walls behind the front desk stated that check in was at 3,2
1470,i would say this hotel was one of the few hotels in the,2
1471,the breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds,2
1472,the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
1473,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
1474,room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
1475,not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
1476,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
1477,we told them again and they said they would send someone to fix it,2
1478,lady at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
1479,the second room smelled so bad that i had to open up the back stick my hand in and correct the problem,2
1480,the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
1481,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
1482,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
1483,the indoor pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
1484,the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
1485,however due to a lightening storm before we arrived the wifi was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
1486,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel mid stay,2
1487,if you are on vacation and want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place,2
1488,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk staff were courteous and helpful,2
1489,it stated that it was a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
1490,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
1491,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
1492,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
1493,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
1494,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
1495,imagine a hotel 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
1496,refrigerator did not work and we were told to try here,2
1497,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
1498,even worse when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
1499,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
1500,so needless to say we will not be staying at this hotel again unless it had,2
1501,plastic egg patties we were in the air was broken,2
1502,meanwhile the sign in the room says if we don't have a lot of work to bring it up to par,2
1503,they charge for parking which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
1504,received a call from chase and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
1505,when i checked in i went to my room it was propped open with the lights on,2
1506,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
1507,would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
1508,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but would definitely not book it through hotels,2
1509,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't expecting a lot,2
1510,and the lady on the phone said it hadn't even been vacuumed,2
1511,traveling alone and needed room for one night and this was through,2
1512,about 7 am in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids,2
1513,all hotel staff were friendly and helpful we were able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
1514,the good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner worked and the tv worked,2
1515,it stink i had to go to the beach to swim in a pool this is for you,2
1516,we had a non-smoking room in-room coffee and comfortable work space,2
1517,the gal at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a full size bed that was super hard,2
1518,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
1519,i took my mother there last week and it was not very clean there was dust on top of the dirty sheet,2
1520,we were woke up many times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
1521,the second room did not have air conditioning,2
1522,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at quality inn in radford virginia,2
1523,i will not stay at this location never,2
1524,this is the 3rd or 4th year my husband i have stayed here multiple times in the past but probably not again,2
1525,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have a room in the same building,2
1526,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the room but it didn't work correctly,2
1527,i stayed at this hotel because it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
1528,our room looked like it had not been vacuumed and also had stains,2
1529,tried to call downstairs and the phone did not work and when asked to be moved to a,2
1530,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
1531,we had to drive down the street to check in to a different hotel mid stay,2
1532,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
1533,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
1534,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff were courteous and helpful,2
1535,took all night to warm up even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room,2
1536,set in lush green mountains the location of this b and b was in a very convenient location,2
1537,everyone was nice and polite but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
1538,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
1539,we got there and our room was on the end so it was very dim,2
1540,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
1541,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
1542,it stink i had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
1543,i asked her if i was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
1544,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
1545,locals renting rooms did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
1546,99 each night for 2 nights and it never got cleaned,2
1547,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
1548,it is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
1549,we asked for a room that justified 178,2
1550,there was a long line to get into the pool area was broken,2
1551,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
1552,out the front door the hotel is located in bad area,2

1554,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
1555,the heater in the room was very dirty,2
1556,it is situated right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2

1560,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff were super friendly,2
1561,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
1562,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
1563,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
1564,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
1565,i had to go to the hampton inn,2
1566,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor right above the grill area,2
1567,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
1568,and it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
1569,the towels and pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
1570,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
1571,good points the bed was comfortable and firm,2
1572,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and not much is being done to keep it up,2
1573,i probably won't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
1574,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
1575,the size of the room was rather dismaying,2
1576,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was uncomfortable,2
1577,the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
1578,there was only one clerk at the front desk was dismissive with the flaws we encountered,2
1579,great place to stay for one night for each room,2
1580,the heater unit makes a lot of noise as highway 101 is loud,2
1581,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
1582,i asked if i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
1583,i would never recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
1584,our room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
1585,when i got to my room i couldn't believe it,2
1586,the hotel and our room smelled so bad that i had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room,2
1587,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i had prepaid for a four night stay at this hotel,2
1588,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2

1590,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed,2
1591,the location was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
1592,no need to book a room here again,2
1593,the man clerk at the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
1594,in the early morning i was trying to take a shower the shower head broke off,2

1596,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
1597,juice machine broken had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
1598,it is truly run down and not as clean as our last visit,2
1599,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
1600,about the only nice thing i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
1601,told the front desk someone signed off that my room hadn't been cleaned yet,2
1602,the indoor pool and hot tub were not in operation and there was no breakfast at the motel,2
1603,not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
1604,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room,2
1605,very difficult to get a good night's sleep as the beds were comfortable and the free wifi,2
1606,upon entering the room part of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
1607,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
1608,we have stayed at this hotel as it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the train station,2
1609,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
1610,hotel outside look nice but inside hallway is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
1611,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
1612,will not be returning to this hotel was so disappointing,2
1613,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
1614,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
1615,it was nice to be within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
1616,when i tried to call hotels to get assistance they gave me a double bed when i booked a queen size bed,2
1617,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
1618,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
1619,it was not a great stay for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
1620,if i didn't have any available,2
1621,weird part 1 was the second room did not have the information required,2
1622,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
1623,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
1624,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was worn out and used,2
1625,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel because it was close to the port,2
1626,i reported this to the desk and they said they d fix it,2
1627,check in was quick but when we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
1628,they were busy when we got there and our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
1629,our room was like a marriott room which is fine but one always seemed to not know what they were doing,2
1630,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
1631,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything going on next door to you,2
1632,i thought it was a cheap place to stay if you need a quick and short stay for one night and this was through,2
1633,i called the front desk for that on the second day no one from housekeeping even serviced the room,2
1634,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
1635,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
1636,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk and they put us in another room,2
1637,i will not be back to stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
1638,in fact this did not turn out to be true the hotel has a lot of guests cockroachs cats etc,2
1639,you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
1640,the hotel is outdated and in need of significant upgrades,2
1641,when we arrived to check in i was told we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
1642,it's a place to stay be warned,2
1643,we are a married couple and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
1644,there was water on the floor in the bathroom the walls had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
1645,i had a suite which was large and quiet but the rooms are run down along with the remainder of the hotel,2
1646,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
1647,for the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
1648,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
1649,people were smoking next to the back door with the door propped open with a piece of wood,2
1650,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the wall burns in the comforter phone didn't work very well,2
1651,had to wear shoes in the room the entire time we were there even though i told them several times,2
1652,didn't like the fact that the area of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here,2
1653,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the carpets that i had to ask for it to be this bad,2
1654,when we arrived we were told we had to pay 48 extra,2
1655,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
1656,he's stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be worse then the last,2
1657,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
1658,thankfully we didn't stay after the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
1659,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
1660,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
1661,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
1662,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
1663,was gone for the night and noticed that the bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable,2
1664,while the bedding and towels were clean and nice but the hallways were dirty and carpet was in need of replacement,2
1665,there breakfast was very disappointing had to take a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
1666,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
1667,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
1668,we needed a place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
1669,the guys at the front desk was helpfull,2
1670,so we stopped by the front desk on our way to texas and the room was dirty,2
1671,it was creepy and it was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
1672,the staff was very nice and the bed was comfy,2
1673,this room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
1674,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was called twice,2
1675,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
1676,as the saying goes you get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
1677,the location of this hotel is below acceptable,2
1678,had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there we were given the wrong room,2
1679,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't lock after hours,2
1680,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is old and tired,2
1681,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not clean enough dirts around door windows the sink stuck,2
1682,the room was small and needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
1683,but if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
1684,it was creepy and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
1685,the was clean and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were horrible,2
1686,it was not a great stay for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
1687,i actually touched it and it was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with the a c on,2
1688,so we didn't let them know and by the time we got there it was cold the pool area was nice,2
1689,pool closed early the night we checked in and went to our room,2
1690,this hotel was very outdated and the room was extremely over priced for the service and quality of the room,2
1691,so we called and asked to be moved the lady on the phone in room service was really rude and short with me,2
1692,my stay was disappointing to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
1693,i felt like i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
1694,only only only plus for this hotel is the the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
1695,there was hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be a motel where people live there not just stay overnight,2
1696,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
1697,the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
1698,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
1699,when i checked in the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
1700,i called in at the front desk is boxed with glass,2
1701,room was very old and very run down,2
1702,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
1703,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
1704,alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
1705,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
1706,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
1707,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have a room with two double beds,2
1708,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
1709,the kids enjoyed the big slide but the water in the hotel was the bottle of water available at the front door,2
1710,i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
1711,we had a room on the first floor,2
1712,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
1713,there was a roach in my room there was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
1714,the room was definitely not worth the price we paid,2
1715,non smoking room and the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
1716,thank goodness that the room was basically clean,2
1717,i would never stay at a dt again,2
1718,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had not requested it and i had to leave,2
1719,byron the live-in manager was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
1720,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the front desk of a similar incidence,2
1721,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
1722,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
1723,i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
1724,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
1725,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
1726,3rd time i have stayed here a few weeks back for a night and was promised a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
1727,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
1728,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
1729,the room was clean but very run down,2
1730,it loozed a little run down and the room was average,2
1731,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
1732,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
1733,the cleaning of the room was great for the deal but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
1734,it made it very uncomfortable there were lots of light bulbs missing from light fixtures,2
1735,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
1736,our room was supposed to be a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
1737,i called the front desk at all times,2
1738,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
1739,the website stated that the room had a very strong odor and we changed the room immediately,2
1740,due to great driving conditions my wife and i to constantly roll to the middle,2
1741,good points the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the grounds are nice,2
1742,my initial reaction when we arrived to the hotel we called to double check what time we could check-in,2
1743,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
1744,don't think i have ever seen in my life,2
1745,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
1746,was gone for the night and thought we'd try it,2
1747,it was one of the worst i have ever experienced,2
1748,not to sound knit picky but the stairs that we had to put dryer sheets in the ac vents because it smelled so bad,2
1749,was a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
1750,front staff were friendly and helpful we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
1751,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
1752,the armchair in the room was not clean,2
1753,the breakfast was nice and the breakfast was not great either,2
1754,was not aware until check that the only room available for the price that we paid,2
1755,it's a bit run down and drab,2
1756,the bed was so high i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
1757,the toilet in the restroom didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
1758,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
1759,they apologized and said it would be refunded she said 7-10 days,2
1760,do not expect much for breakfast same items everyday and not a lot of amenities the room had an unpleasant odor,2
1761,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in the disneyland resort you don't even get a mint,2
1762,hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
1763,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi was slower than dial up,2
1764,the carpet in the room was very noisy,2
1765,almost gagged when we open the door to the emergency exit was kicked out and had graffiti,2
1766,towels were stained and i did not feel safe in the dark,2
1767,not enough parking spaces for the number of guests you have,2
1768,it is close to the highway and our rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
1769,cheapest in the area if you don't have to drag my with me,2
1770,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for oatmeal was lukewarm,2
1771,the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working properly when i was there very disappointing,2
1772,we checked in found that the room was nice and comfortable,2
1773,when i called the hotel and they said it was the surrounding restaurants,2
1774,could hear tv all night in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
1775,the hotel is in renovation but in the middle of july is kind of important,2
1776,this room was small and did not have enough to give,2
1777,i understand that it is a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work,2
1778,overall if you are just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
1779,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
1780,would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
1781,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
1782,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the curtains-the carpet was wet,2
1783,the bedding was ok the towels were a little dingy and didn't seem like a room change would have been very easy,2
1784,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
1785,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
1786,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
1787,a dog did his business in the elevator and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
1788,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower and all that went down,2
1789,asked for a room upgrade and were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
1790,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
1791,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
1792,air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed,2
1793,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
1794,our first clue of how this stay was going to go back down to lobby to get bedding,2
1795,this is the very first we went to the room it did not appear to be clean,2
1796,meanwhile the sign in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front desk,2
1797,i finally called the front desk to request each thing,2
1798,was very disappointed with the room it was very outdated and heavily textured walls seemed very dirty,2
1799,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
1800,almost turned around when we got to our room the odor was awful,2
1801,i was disappointed in the size of the room was much cheaper upon check out than when i booked it,2
1802,the front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
1803,because the stay was free i don't have any it's been low for a while,2
1804,the room was pretty nice but the bathroom definitely needs to be updated just like the rest of the floor,2
1805,the soap and shampoos where horrible smelling and i had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee,2
1806,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
1807,i would only stay the hotel if it was the same place we'd stayed at a different hotel,2
1808,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
1809,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
1810,despite keeping my expectations low i was very disappointed when i'd inadvertently left a new 125,2
1811,the rooms had old decor and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were horrible,2
1812,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
1813,it's about 20 min walk to the center the hotel is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
1814,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
1815,we stayed here for 2 nights and the room was as secure as it could have been,2
1816,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
1817,i stayed at knight's inn for 3 nights while visiting my son thanksgiving,2
1818,the room was clean but very run down,2
1819,they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
1820,we stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
1821,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to sleep in it,2
1822,front desk staff somewhat aloof initially sent us to a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so dirty,2
1823,it is in desperate need of an update,2
1824,i was surprised at the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
1825,we asked for a higher level room they said they didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
1826,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
1827,the good thing was the front desk staff was good,2
1828,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
1829,i will not stay at this hotel if you are a hotel snob stay as far away from this hotel,2
1830,almost gagged when we open the door to the emergency exit was kicked out and had graffiti,2
1831,i immediately called the front desk to request each thing,2
1832,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though we booked a non smoking room,2
1833,after i returned home i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
1834,when we arrived there was no one at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
1835,but the room were clean and the bathroom was clean,2
1836,the lobby was nice and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
1837,when i got to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
1838,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
1839,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
1840,we would not stay at this property again,2
1841,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
1842,small lobby and no actual front check in desk i noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not good,2
1843,we only stayed 1 night because it was so slippery only to find out that my room had been renovated,2
1844,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
1845,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and it didn't look like it had been slept in,2
1846,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
1847,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room,2
1848,this of course is not necessarily the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
1849,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
1850,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
1851,mold in the shower and the rest of my party,2
1852,otherwise this was a 2 star hotel in a undesirable location,2
1853,staff were nice and friendly but the room was clammy,2
1854,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no place to put our head after a christmas party,2
1855,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
1856,this continued through the night so needless to say we won't be staying at this hotel again,2
1857,i reported it to the front desk and they were met at another room,2
1858,we had to ask for towels they did not have iced tea made for breakfast but whipped some up for me,2
1859,the room was okay but the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
1860,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
1861,this is not a corporate location and i could tell by the customer service when we checked in close to midnight,2
1862,the bad my reservation was messed up when i got there,2
1863,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
1864,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is the 20minute walk to arch de triomphe and champs lyses,2
1865,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
1866,bob the manager didn't want to take a shower,2
1867,there was no iron in the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
1868,the coffee maker in the room did not have a part,2
1869,booked a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
1870,could hear thepeople in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
1871,one of the rooms i was placed in looked like something out of a fun house,2
1872,00 as soon as i came in which seemed standard the lady at the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
1873,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
1874,it turns out it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
1875,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
1876,it is an older hotel but if you are just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
1877,the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
1878,i was also puzzled at the lack of control the hotel staff had hand-written our credit card number on a list,2
1879,question is it due to the fact we are japanese plus had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
1880,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
1881,the key to open the door to the non-smoking room,2
1882,the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
1883,after going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a room on the ground floor,2
1884,the room was small and old and the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that,2
1885,why couldn't they put me in a non smoking room,2
1886,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot also,2
1887,about 8:00 pm still no bed so we again asked the front desk for that on the second day,2
1888,we ordered towels early in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
1889,folks running the front desk were i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
1890,it looked like it had been slept in,2
1891,the room was warm as the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working properly when i was there,2
1892,staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
1893,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
1894,the size of the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
1895,when my husband went to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
1896,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
1897,we had to ask for towels to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
1898,outdated hotel i will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door,2
1899,the room was very small and not clean,2
1900,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
1901,if your looking for okay rates and just need a place to crash it will do but our previous stay cost less,2
1902,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly,2
1903,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
1904,we were there in july and the breakfast room was visited by one of the most inequiped and dirty places i've visited,2
1905,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
1906,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there,2
1907,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a safe in the room but it didn't work correctly,2
1908,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
1909,i should have went to front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
1910,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
1911,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be back to stay at this motel again,2
1912,the king size bed that was super hard,2
1913,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
1914,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
1915,you just have to lure an employee to the front desk and told them of the issues,2
1916,under construction had to turn off the one in the room is incorrect,2
1917,it was 6:15 in the morning and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
1918,also room was listed as smoking and when i checked out and they seemed very concerned,2
1919,we had a problem with the tub,2
1920,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
1921,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
1922,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel if you are a senior,2
1923,during the stay the room was very worn and noisy,2
1924,even the walls behind the front desk stated that check in was at 3,2
1925,3rd time i have stayed here a few times this time i was with my team traveling for a soccer tornument in west virginia,2
1926,and that the hot tub was not working,2
1927,we were able to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
1928,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in an old smelly hospice facilty,2
1929,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
1930,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
1931,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
1932,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of july is kind of important,2
1933,also the indoor pool was closed for the whole stay,2
1934,not convenient if your on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
1935,later i asked the front desk for guests,2
1936,the desk was notified and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
1937,i think the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
1938,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the dirty sheet,2
1939,no towels in the room when i come to these types of places to house their people,2
1940,the management owners are very nice the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious and smelled appeared clean we found it needs some updates,2
1941,to use the kitchen you have to ask the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot,2
1942,the walls are super thin you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
1943,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
1944,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
1945,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
1946,an average cheap hotel but if you are just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
1947,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend this hotel for this reason,2
1948,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt which is not,2
1949,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
1950,with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
1951,the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not clean and the floor were uneven and needed repairs,2
1952,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
1953,called to front desk and found that the individual in charge for the night was pretty good and the room was not very clean,2
1954,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
1955,i have stayed at this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
1956,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
1957,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and uncomfortable,2
1958,the distance was a big problem and i feel the front desk was very sweet but the room was clammy,2
1959,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
1960,we stayed at this hotel many times over the years and never cleaned,2
1961,we stayed for one night on a road trip but over priced for the condition of the hotel not,2
1962,there are maybe 4 tables in the pool area and closer to the beach area,2
1963,it might be ok for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
1964,question is it due to the fact we are japanese plus had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
1965,when i mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk to ask for an additional mattress the front desk clerk the staff was rude,2
1966,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
1967,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
1968,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
1969,the clerk was friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
1970,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
1971,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
1972,would not recommend or stay again at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone,2
1973,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk actually lied and told me it would be quiet,2
1974,we booked nonsmoking but the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
1975,there was lipstick on one of the beds were broken,2
1976,staff was courteous and room was clean and i felt like i was on an undercover program,2
1977,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
1978,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
1979,but was in a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
1980,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
1981,i have stayed here a few weeks back for a night and it was dealt with promptly,2
1982,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to ask for towels to take a shower,2
1983,bottomline i will not stay there again especially for 100,2
1984,even worse when i went to check out the clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
1985,the check-in staff was friendly and it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
1986,it's about 20 min walk to the center the hotel is in need of a remodel,2
1987,my second time staying there the location is great and with good expectations we stopped here again,2
1988,the a c was not turned on by the front desk on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
1989,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
1990,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not recommend this hotel to anyone i cared about,2
1991,the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
1992,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
1993,i was up most of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
1994,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
1995,the rooms had old decor and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible,2
1996,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
1997,they did have free breakfast and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
1998,i requested a king size bed when i booked a queen size bed,2
1999,price was the best thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
2000,the place wasn't bad for the price but don't expect much of them,2
2001,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
2002,we thought the hotel was a bit run down and could use updating,2
2003,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
2004,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
2005,the me t day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
2006,the lady at the desk said ok like it wasn't a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
2007,the view was nice i was able to buy was from a vending machine,2
2008,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
2009,i thank god that it was a place to stay if you are traveling,2
2010,for the price we paid i would not stay here with children especially with toddlers,2
2011,the bed was comfortable but i would only stay the hotel if it was the last room available,2
2012,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
2013,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
2014,i can take some wear if the place is a hotel or convention center,2
2015,when we arrived we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to get the room i asked for,2
2016,i stay at the quality inn and it is in need of an upgrade and a better quality of breakfast,2
2017,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
2018,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
2019,when we got back the room had been cleaned and the corners looked like they had never been cleaned,2
2020,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
2021,i immediately called the front desk and let them know,2
2022,reserved a room with a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
2023,hotel is outdated and in need of an upgrade and a better quality of coffee maker,2
2024,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
2025,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
2026,the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a hotel around the corner,2
2027,the room did not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
2028,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
2029,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
2030,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be staying here again,2
2031,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
2032,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
2033,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a small fridge in the rooms which we missed,2
2034,when i checked in the desk clerk told me i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2035,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
2036,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
2037,about the only nice thing i can say is the front desk staff was friendly,2
2038,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
2039,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
2040,the pool and restaurants looked great but we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the gas station to get bags of ice,2
2041,i discovered this in the first room they assigned me was an upgrade,2
2042,and it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
2043,the hotel really needs to be updated just like the rest of the guests in his charge,2
2044,the good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
2045,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
2046,over all i was very disappointed in this room for the price i expected much better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
2047,staff is very nice and friendly negative found live bedbug right next to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
2048,they want you to record your life at the front desk upon checkout and was told it was closed for a private function,2
2049,the carpet in the hall and the smoking on the other on the third floor so was not about to personally go to the desk,2
2050,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
2051,staff was very nice and the bed was so uncomfortable,2
2052,maybe if the hotel room was dirty and dilapidated,2
2053,when i went to the front desk and request more,2
2054,dont think i would stay there again,2
2055,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
2056,the hotel has appealing decor and lighting and i prefer to stay at a 5 star while only paying for a 1 star,2
2057,i stay in a lot of little ways,2
2058,we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
2059,they came and changed it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
2060,the free breakfast is good and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
2061,the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
2062,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
2063,the hotel really needs to be updated through out hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
2064,front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
2065,it has been a long time since i stayed in a hotel room that was so dirty,2
2066,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
2067,under construction had to turn off the one in the room is incorrect,2
2068,the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
2069,we stayed at this hotel because it was a pet friendly motel,2
2070,the bathroom was extremely small and the drains didn't work well nor the wi-fi would not connect,2
2071,i'm never going to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
2072,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
2073,it's ran by foreigners that have an attitude and are not happy to be there for a few days but the excitement ended there,2
2074,good points the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
2075,a c was not turned on and warm,2
2076,i was told i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
2077,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
2078,the service was very slow and struggled felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
2079,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom,2
2080,unfortunately our bed was extremely uncomfortable the hot tub didn't work then when they fix it only 2 jets worked,2
2081,we probably wont be staying here again,2
2082,the next night i got a call from the front desk to request each thing,2
2083,my concern was that it would be most convenient for me to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
2084,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
2085,front desk had me down for one room,2
2086,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front desk told her that they do not know about it,2
2087,the sheets were clean but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not change rooms,2
2088,i requested a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time,2
2089,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
2090,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
2091,was moved to another room and it wasn't horrible either,2
2092,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was very helpful for our issue,2
2093,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
2094,the girl at the desk came and briefly looked at it and it went beneath the bed,2
2095,since there was no partking available when we returned from the park at 11 pm and the office was closed,2
2096,the carpet in our room had been there,2
2097,the staff and the breakfast was nice and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
2098,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't have any it's been low for a while,2
2099,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
2100,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
2101,2 in the past the continental breakfast was donuts toast apples or cheerios,2
2102,nothing too great but ok if you just need a place to sleep this one will do,2
2103,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
2104,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
2105,the girl at the front desk and was told maint,2
2106,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
2107,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to sleep with the window open,2
2108,called to complain about the air the room was very small the room was a nonsmoking room but it stunk like smoke,2
2109,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
2110,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for one room,2
2111,only took 2 hours to get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking in it and they did nothing to fix it,2
2112,i hate the fremont street area but the price was reasonable and we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
2113,i booked through expedia and my room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged when we arrived,2
2114,she was polite but didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
2115,front desk clerk harassed me as soon as i got in the room i was in,2
2116,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even though our non smoking room was on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
2117,the second room we were put in the ac didn't work and pool was green and closed charged me incorrectly at check in etc,2
2118,upon entering the room it was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
2119,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
2120,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
2121,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
2122,the sign posted behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to fix it on our own,2
2123,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
2124,the only problem i had was that there was only one partially used roll of toilet paper,2
2125,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it had not been vacuumed and the bed was uncomfortable,2
2126,the hotel told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
2127,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
2128,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
2129,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
2130,front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even any kids meal items on the menu for room service,2
2131,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
2132,needs to be updated through out hotel is old and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
2133,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
2134,when we arrived our first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
2135,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
2136,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
2137,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were uncomfortable and each bed only had 3 little square pillows,2
2138,we checked into the hotel late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
2139,i should have went to front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
2140,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a room that's about all you get at the super 8,2
2141,room was small and old and the bed was comfortable and the correct comforter weight is in use,2
2142,there was no phone in the room was difficult to regulate,2
2143,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
2144,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
2145,the free breakfast was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to stay each time we visit,2
2146,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
2147,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for 2 hours for the room to be mildly comfortable and we had to be evacuated,2
2148,the room did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit outdated,2
2149,my non smoking room smelled like smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
2150,the room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
2151,the check in was plesnty and the staff was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
2152,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
2153,the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach breakfast was bad bed is not comfortable ac was loud,2
2154,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
2155,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
2156,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western plus kelly inn in st cloud mn on 01 30 16,2
2157,set in lush green mountains the location of this b and b was in a very convenient location,2
2158,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room as requested but clearly someone had been smoking in it and they did nothing,2
2159,near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place,2
2160,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
2161,i guess we probably would not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a hilton,2
2162,the room was decent and the breakfast was not great either,2
2163,called for the sheets and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
2164,the carpet and chair in the room had to go to the hampton inn,2
2165,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
2166,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
2167,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't able to book through the wyndham site,2
2168,i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
2169,when i checked in the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
2170,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
2171,there was a rug in front of the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
2172,i was disappointed that they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
2173,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
2174,the outside of the hotel and the neighborhood,2
2175,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours and we had to carry,2
2176,the room was decent for the price but bring ear plugs,2
2177,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
2178,it's a bit run down and drab,2
2179,do not expect much for breakfast same items everyday and not a lot of hotels in the area so not much to pick from,2
2180,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
2181,the light between the bed was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
2182,we stayed for one night on our way to dinner and they said they forgot to fix it,2
2183,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
2184,good points staff is very friendly and so was the shelf above,2
2185,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't work and the owner refused to give us one,2
2186,we were given another room for the second night but the sink wouldn't drain no microwave beds uncomfortable no free breakfast,2
2187,thank goodness that the room was very basic,2
2188,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
2189,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the room next door tv until 3 am,2
2190,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
2191,there was a long line to get into the lobby due to construction,2
2192,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to dunken donuts,2
2193,the staff was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
2194,hotel was as you would expect from a hampton at all,2
2195,the girl at the front desk were i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
2196,at about 11:30 at night when i was there very disappointing,2
2197,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out she did not ask how my stay was,2
2198,the staff was great but the place itself is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
2199,had i not had a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
2200,while i stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
2201,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
2202,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
2203,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
2204,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
2205,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
2206,a lot of casino people stay here and if you get a room at five other hotels before we were told to try here,2
2207,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
2208,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot each night,2
2209,when we arrived there was no one booked in the room above me outside and through the hallway,2
2210,booked another trip and today i was told they were fully booked and the beds were not comfortable,2
2211,they were painting the exterior of the building is inviting but the walls of the building drinking their 40's oz of beer,2
2212,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no way to control the temperature,2
2213,when you close the door to the non-smoking room but we were given a smoking room,2
2214,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
2215,after opening the door to the hallway and the room smelled of mustiness,2
2216,the only positive is the staff but i won't be staying at this hotel again,2
2217,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
2218,expedia messed up reservation booked a family of four into a room with a jet tub and we had to carry,2
2219,nothing great room was clean but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
2220,the desk was notified and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
2221,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
2222,first above all it was not until 4:20 before we could get more towels,2
2223,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for each room,2
2224,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
2225,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
2226,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
2227,to start off with good the front desk staff when we checked in so after trying to get it to lock,2
2228,can't say i would recommend this hotel to anyone,2
2229,the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
2230,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
2231,though the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
2232,at least the staff on the front desk was very sweet but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
2233,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
2234,there was notmany toliets in the room and they said they d fix it,2
2235,there breakfast was very disappointing had to take a smoking room and it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay,2
2236,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i was told it works great in all rooms,2
2237,there were stains all over the tub as well as mold around the tub is not acceptable,2
2238,also on the first night when i returned to the front desk and complain,2
2239,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
2240,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
2241,the hotel guide in the room was awful where it existed,2
2242,bath room could use some work seemed clean but there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
2243,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
2244,if you don't want to be there,2
2245,the good news is that the hotel is clean but to noisy for me and the other one for them,2
2246,our room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
2247,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 again,2
2248,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
2249,we sat in the hallway and a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
2250,i had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there we were given the wrong room,2
2251,last minute incident caused us to stay at this hotel in the summer,2
2252,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
2253,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
2254,i was at patalya last october for a business trip i have no receipt for reimbursement,2
2255,couldn't wait to get out in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
2256,room had a strange smell and it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
2257,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a room,2
2258,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
2259,it was very clear that there was no one at the desk,2
2260,sent me to the room several times i couldn't get one because i didn't give advance notice,2
2261,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
2262,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
2263,we did make management at the front desk for one room,2
2264,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
2265,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
2266,no amenities were in the room with you,2
2267,overall the room was not as clean as other hampton inns,2
2268,i was disappointed at the amount of time i had to wait for them to check if a room was clean,2
2269,bed was good was able to sleep after the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
2270,i felt discriminated at the registration desk they were very rude and i won't be staying at this hotel again,2
2271,since my room was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
2272,it actually made it very difficult for me to navigate my way to the casino lobby and eventually found someone working,2
2273,took a shower walked on the floor and the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip,2
2274,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
2275,question is it due to the fact we are japanese plus had to pay for another night but was moved to a different room,2
2276,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
2277,we had to sleep with no covers because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
2278,the room was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
2279,we probably wont be staying here again,2
2280,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
2281,the bathroom was dirty and the bathroom was even colder,2
2282,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
2283,when i arrived it was hard to get what we needed,2
2284,door handle broke inside the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
2285,the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a 30 second connection,2
2286,i asked to have it repaired nice young lady at the front desk upon checkout and was told it would be ready in the morning,2
2287,the room was not very clean and breakfast was not very good,2
2288,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
2289,the non-smoking rooms were on one side of the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
2290,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
2291,i am not sure i will stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
2292,we stayed at this hotel before a few years ago in another city,2
2293,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
2294,after that on our way to the hotel we thought it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
2295,my wife son and i stayed at this hotel before a few years ago,2
2296,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and i had no hot water,2
2297,small dim musty lobby and the room was extremely over dated,2
2298,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
2299,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
2300,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
2301,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
2302,when we booked we thought it was only for one night,2
2303,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
2304,didn't know we had to pay every time we parked in the car park when we arrived and upon departure,2
2305,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
2306,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
2307,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
2308,most best westerns i've stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
2309,there were ants crawling in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of the night,2
2310,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the place,2
2311,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
2312,everything on the bed was old the linens didn't smell clean either,2
2313,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and living room,2
2314,called for the sheets and was told to mk bed ourselves,2
2315,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
2316,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
2317,my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
2318,this place is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for what you get your paying a lot,2
2319,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
2320,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
2321,the front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
2322,i had the impression that we were given an inferiour room because it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay,2
2323,it did not show that it was an old man smell,2
2324,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
2325,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
2326,front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even any kids meal items on the menu for room service,2
2327,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they even replace the sheets,2
2328,we ended up leaving this place a night early and going to another hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
2329,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,2
2330,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
2331,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
2332,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
2333,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was clean,2
2334,if you need an elevator this is not the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
2335,will most likely not stay here again as the price was economical,2
2336,this continued through the night so needless to say i am never going to stay there again,2
2337,we then got to our room there was an odor,2
2338,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was filthy,2
2339,the hotel location was good for us but i won't stay there again being that the area was very rough at night,2
2340,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
2341,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't speak english very well so maybe that's the communication barrier,2
2342,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
2343,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
2344,i stayed in berkeley 40 just for one day and we did not ask for that,2
2345,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
2346,we had a non-smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
2347,in general the only good thing is there were no bed bugs,2
2348,i booked a room for my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and they said it wasn't ready,2
2349,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to the sawgrass mills mall,2
2350,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for the shower overall a bummer,2
2351,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
2352,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was old,2
2353,you wouldn't know this if you don't mind parking on the street,2
2354,we stayed 1 night at this hotel we only stayed three nights,2
2355,the bathroom had to be the smallest i've ever seen in my life,2
2356,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and i will not recommend to family or friends,2
2357,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
2358,you could hear everyone around you as well as the people we were visiting,2
2359,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
2360,but the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
2361,the gym had a treadmill that did not work and we were told to try here,2
2362,even though we stayed in a non-smoking room which had obviously been a smoking room recently,2
2363,staff were nice and friendly but the room was not a good deal,2
2364,the service was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
2365,i would consider going back there if it was a very quiet location with great views,2
2366,it was very cold outside and we couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to sleep in it,2
2367,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
2368,the only clean things in the hotel room with toiletries and had to call the front desk at all times,2
2369,the location was good as we were able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
2370,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
2371,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
2372,the carpets in the hallways are old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
2373,we had to sleep with no covers because it was so slippery only to find out that my room had been renovated,2
2374,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
2375,we probably wont be staying here again,2
2376,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
2377,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
2378,after going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site,2
2379,we tried to go to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and room was clean,2
2380,if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
2381,the television is one of the room amenities,2
2382,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel en route to vandalia on our way home from vacation,2
2383,by far one of the worst i have had very good meals there,2
2384,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
2385,even worse when i went to check out the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not working,2
2386,when i checked in the bed was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
2387,i felt like the room was not working no channel,2
2388,we wanted a king bed and was told there was not one mccamlyplaza amenities,2
2389,i would stay here again as there seemed to be a fire hazard,2
2390,he did not speak when we first walked into our room you can tell the queen beds were not comfortable,2
2391,everyone was nice and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
2392,the other location's pictures look nothing like the pictures the rooms are very clean and spacious,2
2393,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
2394,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
2395,the carpet in our room had been there,2
2396,location was within walking distance to downtown chico,2
2397,my initial reaction when we arrived to the hotel we called to double check what time we could check-in,2
2398,we told them again and they said they would send someone to fix it,2
2399,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the room was very small and not clean,2
2400,when we got to our room the odor was awful,2
2401,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot,2
2402,this is the first time we have used this web site we could not get any kind of refund on the room,2
2403,our room was right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
2404,however the room was so dim and when we went to check out the pool it was closed,2
2405,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the sheets the first night,2
2406,second room they moved us to a different room,2
2407,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
2408,the hotel and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
2409,i read reviews of this hotel while looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not return,2
2410,i called in advance and asked if there was something that could be done the girl at the front desk was helpfull,2
2411,this is the last time i stayed at this hotel at least 3 times this year,2
2412,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a hot weekend and all of their ice machines weren't working hmmm,2
2413,the next morning the lady at reception simply handed me a map of all of cape cod i wanted the immediate area,2
2414,they basically put a clean sheet on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
2415,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
2416,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
2417,this continued through the night so needless to say we will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future,2
2418,i called the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
2419,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't want a jacuzzi room,2
2420,so needless to say i am never going to stay in this hotel,2
2421,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
2422,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
2423,8 rating i knew it would be under my door,2
2424,family coming for vacation i would not recommend anyone to stay here until an update was completed or a thorough clean was done,2
2425,she asked if i was looking for a place to sleep this one will do,2
2426,the bathroom had hair on the floor and the room smelled,2
2427,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
2428,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
2429,still half the price of big chains so if you only want a room for one night on our way to florida and back,2
2430,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no previous disclosure,2
2431,i needed a room for the night i did not use,2
2432,so they put us in a room with no difference,2
2433,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
2434,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
2435,the staff was very friendly and polite but the room itself,2
2436,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
2437,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
2438,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
2439,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
2440,this was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
2441,charged 200 for room since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
2442,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
2443,over all i was very disappointed with the westin,2
2444,not convenient if your on the second floor was still out,2
2445,we inquired how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know and didn't have access to that information,2
2446,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the supplies were in our room and your knees hit the bathtub while sitting on the toilet,2
2447,the best i can say about the hotel,2
2448,i didn't like that the room had a gas smell to me that never went away,2
2449,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be a motel where people live there not just stay overnight,2
2450,i made a reservation for 2 adults 3 children for a suite with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
2451,also the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have an over funky smell that permeated throughout the lobby and elevator,2
2452,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache,2
2453,there is no one at the front desk were very nice the guy in the next room and there was hair in my bath tub,2
2454,i paid for a rollout and when i returned to the front desk and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
2455,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
2456,the sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been really nice but the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to care much,2
2457,she asked if i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
2458,i guess you get what you pay for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
2459,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to everything,2
2460,i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing,2
2461,room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
2462,it loozed a little run down and the room was still warm,2
2463,i called in at the front desk i called the hotel and they said it was expedia's fault,2
2464,the bathroom in the shower and the rest of my party,2
2465,the shower in hotel room had no hot water for hot cocoa or hot cereal,2
2466,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
2467,the hotel made minority's feel uncomfortable when we walked into the hotel the lobby reeked of smoke though there were no smoking signs posted,2
2468,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
2469,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
2470,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
2471,we were unlucky first of all being woken up in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
2472,i have stayed here multiple times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
2473,we stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
2474,my first impression was that it is great compared to a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
2475,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
2476,and the patio do didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
2477,disappointed in the price we paid in hotel and the price the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected,2
2478,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a big centipede in our room,2
2479,but it was close to the superman museum about 10-15 minutes just to get to the elevator,2
2480,when we got into our room there was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
2481,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
2482,the room was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
2483,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid the level was not there,2
2484,i had decided to give it another try but sincerely doubt it,2
2485,hot tub pool area was very nice but the rest of the hotel,2
2486,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
2487,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
2488,tried staying here twice both times there was a problem with the stoe so no hot foods,2
2489,i definitely will not be staying here again,2
2490,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the walls,2
2491,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
2492,the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
2493,the comforter on the bed was old the linens didn't fit the large closet,2
2494,i would probably stay there again if it was the last hotel in the city,2
2495,the pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of october for a one night stay but we won't return,2
2496,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the hotel,2
2497,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm,2
2498,i am not pleased with how the maids cleaned up the room during the middle of the night sweating and wheezing,2
2499,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
2500,i would say this hotel was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
2501,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
2502,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
2503,i travel frequently and i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
2504,also front desk staff was great and friendly,2
2505,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
2506,when i complained to the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot,2
2507,finally got a room in the same building,2
2508,the tv wasn't even plugged in we had to figure out how to get our credit card read took forever to check in,2
2509,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one large towel the one for the floor and two face towels,2
2510,night one went out for dinner and had to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
2511,hotel was as you would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
2512,noise was terrible and room had a musty smell to it,2
2513,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was down for repairs,2
2514,the hotel was very empty and our room was on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
2515,overall ok experience for the price you pay,2
2516,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times in the past,2
2517,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
2518,when i arrived they didn't have a room for someone with a bad back,2
2519,the view was nice i was able to get a refund from hotels,2
2520,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
2521,hotel room was as clean as it should have been,2
2522,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
2523,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
2524,the outside of the hotel and the neighborhood,2
2525,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
2526,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean on arrival,2
2527,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
2528,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at the courtyard down the street and love it here,2
2529,if all you need is a place to stay if you are traveling,2
2530,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the water,2
2531,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
2532,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
2533,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
2534,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
2535,we ordered a room with a view of morro rock and within walking distance of this hotel,2
2536,however room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to get the room i asked for,2
2537,we ordered towels early in the morning which was annoying,2
2538,check-in took about 45 minutes to check in,2
2539,the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
2540,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
2541,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for each room,2
2542,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean,2
2543,i called the front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
2544,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
2545,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
2546,staff was nice nice location but the room was generally in bad shape,2
2547,the non-smoking rooms were on one side of the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
2548,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is old and tired,2
2549,we stopped at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
2550,i think this will be the first and last time i will go in this hotel,2
2551,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
2552,when i pay for a hotel room that was so dirty,2
2553,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
2554,the motel is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
2555,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
2556,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
2557,we did get a different room or gave us a heater,2
2558,there was half a roll of toilet paper the person at the front desk upon checkout and was told it would be fixed,2
2559,the shower was so low we had to bend down to talk to the not,2
2560,ok for a one night stay as part of a belated honeymoon and rented the suite on the top floor no elevator,2
2561,we were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was nice,2
2562,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
2563,even worse when i went to check out the front desk is very kind,2
2564,i call the front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
2565,the room was clean that's the best i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
2566,we spent one night then went a few doors down to a much better hotel for the price staff isn't rude,2
2567,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
2568,room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
2569,the continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor was still out,2
2570,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
2571,my room was on the 2nd floor didn't work,2
2572,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
2573,alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
2574,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
2575,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
2576,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
2577,the room i was told i couldn't have been charged,2
2578,however when we arrived the swimming pool was out of order,2
2579,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
2580,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the room that someone booked over a month ago,2
2581,i can take some wear if the place is a hotel or convention center,2
2582,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
2583,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
2584,not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
2585,i booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
2586,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
2587,walls were paper thin we could hear the guests in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
2588,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night,2
2589,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back the room had been cleaned,2
2590,although the rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
2591,given the low price point i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
2592,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel weeks in advance for a wrestling tournament with my son,2
2593,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
2594,took all night to warm up even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
2595,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
2596,it's a place to stay if you are traveling,2
2597,but it was a cheap hotel with shared bath and toilet but it is not that either since the kitchen facilities are limited to,2
2598,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
2599,they charge for parking which i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
2600,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
2601,the pillows on the bed the tv was an old box with horrible sound and color,2
2602,positives sleeper sofa in the room was very simple and plain and completely outdated,2
2603,breakfast was a nice addition but it was not a great stay for the price i paid,2
2604,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took forever to get me my room key and take care of the paperwork,2
2605,our toilet overflowed also and it took awhile for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
2606,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
2607,there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
2608,i will never use them again and i most certainly will never stay at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
2609,only good thing was that it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
2610,i looked at it and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
2611,also the room fan wouldn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
2612,i classify this as you get what you pay for a place to sleep and shower,2
2613,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
2614,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
2615,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
2616,the room was dingy outdated and not as clean as it could be but the mattresses were extremely stained and dirty,2
2617,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
2618,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
2619,walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
2620,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
2621,i don't expect miracles for the price but don't expect much,2
2622,our view out the window was of the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
2623,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to par,2
2624,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
2625,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
2626,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
2627,one word awful and the pool was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
2628,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
2629,the desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the second floor,2
2630,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk i called the hotel from my phone,2
2631,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't family friendly,2
2632,the room is not the same as explained by hotels,2
2633,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
2634,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
2635,the sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been really nice but the paint on the walls and sheets,2
2636,we went to the coast and i didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
2637,they were nice enough to remember to give it to me when i checked in manager informed me all the rooms were non smoking,2
2638,the room was small and did not have enough to give,2
2639,my family and i were in town for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed,2
2640,lighting in the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
2641,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
2642,he said he would call me back after they said they would put us in another room,2
2643,this time the room smelled of pine sole,2
2644,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff were super friendly,2
2645,i booked two rooms and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
2646,front desk didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
2647,i don't know who added the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible,2
2648,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
2649,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
2650,the fire detector was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
2651,we were booked for 3 nights but the room wasn't suppose to be in use they moved me into another room,2
2652,when i tried to get another room i was told i could upgrade when i got there for my week stay,2
2653,the bedding was ok the towels were a little dingy and the furniture was very sparse,2
2654,easy to get to location but this is not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
2655,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything,2
2656,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
2657,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
2658,i will only stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
2659,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
2660,the chair in the room we were in a handicap room,2
2661,staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
2662,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
2663,lobby breakfast area nice but the room is so outdated,2
2664,needless to say we won't be using them again,2
2665,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
2666,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
2667,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot,2
2668,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay,2
2669,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
2670,requested refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
2671,needed a hotel for one night and this was through,2
2672,they charge for parking which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
2673,when we entered the lobby to check out the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
2674,staff were nice and friendly but the room was clean and tidy tho,2
2675,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
2676,however the room didn't have a reservation,2
2677,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
2678,we booked it because it wasn't a big deal,2
2679,there is an odor upon entering the room part of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
2680,location was nice to be within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
2681,last the paint on the walls and sheets,2
2682,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
2683,the good news is that the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
2684,ours was a non smoking room and hall smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
2685,the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
2686,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
2687,the bed was covered in hair as soon as i got in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
2688,front desk worker was really rude when we checked in and kids couldn't use it,2
2689,hot tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
2690,there was no phone in the room was more than filthy,2
2691,no need to book a room here again,2
2692,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come,2
2693,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of october for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
2694,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old the sheets are old and rough nubby,2
2695,upon checking the front desk person about it,2
2696,you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room had to go to the front desk,2
2697,the tv was broken there was a hole in the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
2698,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
2699,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
2700,i called the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
2701,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the gas station to get bags of ice,2
2702,i chose this hotel for as much money as it was it was close to the event we were attending,2
2703,the front facade looks great but the hotel is in a desperate need for refurbishment,2
2704,i was very disappointed in this room for the night i did not use,2
2705,this is the last time i will stay at this hotel,2
2706,almost gagged when we open the door to our room had a terrible odor and floors were dirty,2
2707,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower and all that went down,2
2708,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
2709,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was by far the worst,2
2710,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was clean,2
2711,overall the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to negotiate stairs,2
2712,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times in the past but probably not again,2
2713,however in my reservation i was put into one of the villas at montechristo,2
2714,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
2715,when we called the front desk to see if we were willing to switch to a king size bed on the 1st floor,2
2716,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
2717,i was moved to this hotel because of proximity to st,2
2718,that's one reason why i stayed in this hotel chain before and it was nice,2
2719,we went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
2720,it was awful and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us one,2
2721,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
2722,i have to go to the front desk of this,2
2723,the me t day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
2724,so we stopped by the front desk on our way to texas and the room was as well,2
2725,it was not the worst place we could have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
2726,if you just need a place to lay my head after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
2727,the room was not at all clean the air conditioner didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
2728,i had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
2729,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't stay in this place again,2
2730,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
2731,dont think i would stay there again,2
2732,phones in the room didn't have a microwave in the room,2
2733,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
2734,we got the room keys and the room was clean and some renovations were done lately,2
2735,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
2736,i booked prior to arriving and requested a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
2737,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
2738,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
2739,i paid for a rollout and when i returned to the front desk for that on the second day,2
2740,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western downtown nashville on our way back north,2
2741,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
2742,the room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
2743,room was in good condition the bed was very uncomfortable for the first two nights,2
2744,ice machine didn't work i had to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
2745,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
2746,this time the room smelled of pine sole,2
2747,at 5:00 am i called the front desk and told them of the issues,2
2748,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
2749,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
2750,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
2751,they came into my room we called front desk and they told us they would get going on finishing it up,2
2752,hotel staff was friendly and room was clean though,2
2753,when we got into the room and the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
2754,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
2755,it was my girl birthday so i call them to make sure that there would be a refrigerator and microwave,2
2756,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
2757,there was no electrical outlets with the cord dangling ridiculous we had to set it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
2758,we were disappointed that we didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
2759,for 90 a night the room was small and old and the bed was comfortable and the staff was nice,2
2760,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
2761,we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
2762,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall and the carpet was worn out and filthy,2
2763,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
2764,later i asked if we had to pay for one night for a wedding,2
2765,on this stay there seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
2766,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
2767,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
2768,i definitely will not be staying at this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
2769,the tub and bathroom were very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
2770,could use some work seemed clean but there were a few small maintenance issues,2
2771,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
2772,this was one of the worst i have stayed at this hotel in the future,2
2773,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
2774,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
2775,next morning the breakfast was good but this hotel is not worth the money,2
2776,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
2777,had driven all day and wanted a place to sleep and a quick shower i guess for the price this place is great,2
2778,the young lady at the front desk and request more,2
2779,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2
2780,only a few rooms are available but then you find out that the water pressure was very poor,2
2781,the pillows on the bed the next morning,2
2782,i suppose this was not a bad hotel but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
2783,good all over the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
2784,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
2785,tried to call downstairs and the phone didn't work and pool was green and dirty,2
2786,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and looked like it needed to be vacuumed,2
2787,received a call from chase and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
2788,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
2789,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
2790,juice machine broken had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
2791,told us when we checked in we were told although we requested a king size bed on the 1st floor,2
2792,also the next morning i noticed a used wash cloth hanging on the shower from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
2793,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were helpful,2
2794,would never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel works we won't be back here,2
2795,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
2796,i told the staff they said they would call me back never did,2
2797,on arrival to our room it had not been cleaned and the diaper removed,2
2798,needless to say we were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn for 2 days on business,2
2799,we stayed here for one night on our way back to our room upset,2
2800,couldn't wait to get out in the morning i woke up to 20 worth of spoiled food,2
2801,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
2802,very disappointed and would not stay there again,2
2803,after that on our way to texas and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
2804,it is hard on the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to keep the room cool it was warm,2
2805,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
2806,hotel outside look nice but inside hallway is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
2807,arrived and heater in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
2808,we did not want to take a shower and all that went down,2
2809,upon arrival we asked the front desk and let them know,2
2810,disappointed in that we did not have the information required,2
2811,arrived and heater in the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
2812,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the front desk for one room,2
2813,the water was brown but that may have been due to the color of the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
2814,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
2815,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was worn out and filthy,2
2816,my sister brother-in-law didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me,2
2817,other people told me that they were going to send someone up to check the dogs owners had been called,2
2818,when i was finally greeted i began the check-in staff was friendly and helpful but they seemed very harried all the time,2
2819,really for 135 a night needless to say i have frozen that card and will be replacing it,2
2820,folks running the front desk were i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
2821,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
2822,one of those days that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there,2
2823,the people in the front office and when i went to do my morning push ups and got close to the floor,2
2824,there was food in it still and the front desk was very sweet but the room was not helpful at all,2
2825,my beef is with the front desk staff were very nice and attentive,2
2826,even the walls behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to get into the lobby,2
2827,the best i can say about the hotel,2
2828,we were there for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
2829,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're looking for the better rate it's fine,2
2830,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for one room,2
2831,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
2832,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
2833,checked in had to call for a remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
2834,the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests staying,2
2835,i needed a room for one night on our return,2
2836,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
2837,other parts of the hotel did not provide facial tissues,2
2838,the free breakfast is good and the staff is superior and customer focused,2
2839,we rented fire in the sky for christmas vacation and when we arrived there was no one to check us in,2
2840,had to switch rooms front desk was very sweet but the room was clammy,2
2841,my flight landed around 7 pm and i was leaving the next morning it was a clean but very tight space,2
2842,i was disappointed at the amount of time i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
2843,in the middle of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
2844,when we got to our room the odor was awful,2
2845,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
2846,the rooms where dated it smelled one tv did not work properly door stuck making it hard to fall asleep,2
2847,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
2848,everything in room was nice and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
2849,the bathroom was small and have a roach in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
2850,the location is reliant on a car if you want to walk to any of it's main locations,2
2851,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
2852,our room was listed as smoking and when i checked out she did not ask how my stay was,2
2853,this is the last time i stayed at this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
2854,great location to everything and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
2855,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
2856,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
2857,we needed a place to shower and sleep,2
2858,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room,2
2859,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend it ever stay there again,2
2860,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
2861,when we got to the room it was extremely warm,2
2862,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep i was going to jail,2
2863,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
2864,please do not stay at this property again,2
2865,they were very rude and i won't be staying here again,2
2866,we asked for a room upgrade and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not,2
2867,the wi-fi also doesn't support ssl so it's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming,2
2868,when i checked in the desk clerk told me i could use the computer that is for guest use,2
2869,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
2870,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
2871,the shower floor needed new tile and the toilet had urine and other unidentifiable things around it was ok for the price,2
2872,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
2873,also the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
2874,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
2875,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
2876,rooms also too close and walls so thin you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the door shut and locked,2
2877,for the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
2878,when we got to our room there was only one person on at one time,2
2879,not that nice asked for a non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and it wasn't much better,2
2880,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
2881,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
2882,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
2883,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
2884,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
2885,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
2886,all of the signs indicated it was a non-smoking room which had obviously been a smoking room,2
2887,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the windows,2
2888,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
2889,hot tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
2890,the breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
2891,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff is superior and customer focused,2
2892,i found that our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
2893,the hotel was not full when we were there in the middle of july is kind of important,2
2894,front desk staff were very nice abs helpful,2
2895,we got in late around 10:30p and by the time we were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
2896,this hotel is much in need of a lot of attention,2
2897,front staff were friendly and helpful we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
2898,the view was nice i was up early the next morning to take a shower and the shower head is lo flow,2
2899,it was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and prepare for your socks to look like you were walking outside,2
2900,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
2901,not convenient if your on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
2902,overall the hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
2903,finally it was twice the price it was ok i would give it a c-,2
2904,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to care much,2
2905,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
2906,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
2907,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
2908,our room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks,2
2909,the floor had not been cleaned in weeks,2
2910,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
2911,the hotel location was good for the money,2
2912,was i supprised when i checked in the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
2913,i am not a finicky person when it comes to a place to sleep coming in late in the evening,2
2914,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
2915,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is very close within walking distance of the boardwalk which is great,2
2916,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
2917,this hotel was very outdated and the room was dirty,2
2918,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
2919,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
2920,it's ran by foreigners that have an attitude and are not happy to be there for a few days after you check out,2
2921,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
2922,it's not the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
2923,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
2924,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days although is in a very convenient location,2
2925,the walls are paper thin and the beds were uncomfortable,2
2926,it was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
2927,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned,2
2928,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
2929,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep this will suffice,2
2930,and it did not help to have a room for the night and thought we'd try the newer cambria suites,2
2931,the management owners are very nice the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious and smelled appeared clean we found it needs some updates,2
2932,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything going on next door to you,2
2933,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
2934,i don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
2935,my wife son and i stayed at this hotel because it had a full size fridge small stove microwave etc,2
2936,there was a strong smell of cheap disinfectant and there was no one at the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
2937,visible black mold in the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
2938,when i told these issues to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
2939,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
2940,if you are staying for a few hours,2
2941,when we immediately called the front desk to change rooms and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
2942,the water stunk and the hotel is very conveniently located,2
2943,we were there in july and the breakfast room was so hot it was almost to much to stay to eat,2
2944,the first peculiar thing about this hotel is the the front desk staff was good,2
2945,during my time there i was either taking the exam or in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
2946,the wi-fi also doesn't support ssl so it's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming,2
2947,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
2948,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
2949,the rate for the value is way out of line and have stayed in alot of different places,2
2950,rooms need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
2951,sorry but we will not be back to stay at this hotel again,2
2952,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
2953,the room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
2954,this property is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
2955,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
2956,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
2957,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
2958,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
2959,the desk chair was tore up there were no hangers did not have a dishwasher so i asked for a quiet room,2
2960,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
2961,my other issue was the free breakfast was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
2962,when we booked we thought it was an abandoned building,2
2963,if you only need a place to stay each time we visit,2
2964,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
2965,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
2966,i was forced to upgrade back to the original queen size bed and was told we had a room with 2 queens,2
2967,once i got in the room i was in and hot tub yet again remains out of service,2
2968,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
2969,however i was really disappointed with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect of their standards,2
2970,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2
2971,the third night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the pool was closed for repair,2
2972,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
2973,unfortunately our bed was extremely uncomfortable the hot tub didn't work then when they fix it only 2 jets worked,2
2974,there was no electrical outlets with the cord dangling ridiculous we had to set it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
2975,the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the guy at the reception desk,2
2976,i had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to the front desk for one room,2
2977,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
2978,by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
2979,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head was broken off and was unusable,2
2980,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
2981,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
2982,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back to the hotel on your own,2
2983,breakfast was free but not worth the cost they charged,2
2984,we found cockroaches on the bed the tv was an old box with horrible sound and color,2
2985,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
2986,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
2987,other than that the room was nice and the kitchen clean,2
2988,after opening the door to the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
2989,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
2990,the staff was great but the room was clean the staff were helpful,2
2991,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
2992,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
2993,we were there in july and the breakfast room was so hot it was almost to much to stay to eat,2
2994,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
2995,the coffee maker in the room didn't match the room,2
2996,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for one night on a road trip,2
2997,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
2998,when you close the door to the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
2999,when i tried to express this to the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one,2
3000,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
3001,also there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
3002,the hotel is ridiculously overpriced and is no better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
3003,then next day the staff didn't come to fix it until 10 am the next day,2
3004,the sign posted behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to get our credit card read took forever to check in,2
3005,but if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate lesser hotel,2
3006,i received no sleep at all and we were there for 2 nights and the room was dirty,2
3007,the best thing about this hotel was positive,2
3008,it stated that it was a place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
3009,we needed a place to sleep and shower,2
3010,when you close the door to the hallway and the hotel smelled similar to a hockey locker room,2
3011,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
3012,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no elevator in the hotel,2
3013,one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
3014,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
3015,we needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
3016,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a best western so my expectations shouldn't be high,2
3017,the bed was ok but 2 of the four light fixtures didn't work and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
3018,the staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
3019,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
3020,wasn't able to check in early but the hotel was under repair,2
3021,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but very heavy bleach smell,2
3022,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
3023,the room i was told they would call when a room was ready well,2
3024,because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
3025,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
3026,there were ants in the room which was fine,2
3027,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
3028,pretty clean except i don't think the sheets were clean if you need a cheap place,2
3029,room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
3030,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
3031,our room looked like it had not been cleaned in a long time,2
3032,but it's a property in need of a good update in the general areas,2
3033,i requested a non smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
3034,there was mold everywhere and one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
3035,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
3036,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't know that which is about 28 a day,2
3037,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
3038,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
3039,i chose this hotel for as much money as it was it was close to the superman museum about 10-15 minutes away,2
3040,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
3041,room smelled of smoke even though we booked a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
3042,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was acceptable and as described,2
3043,the second room was a bit run down,2
3044,the receptionist said they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in a room on the 3rd floor,2
3045,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
3046,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
3047,after that on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
3048,we came back to the room for the price i paid,2
3049,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
3050,was a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
3051,i stay in a lot of little ways,2
3052,why couldn't they put me in a room that was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
3053,hotel was as you would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
3054,staying in winston-salem was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
3055,the room was so dim and when we went to check out the pool it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
3056,i will say lady at front desk was very nice but the ownership is clearly not trying to present a quality product,2
3057,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
3058,so they put us in a room with a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
3059,the front desk person was nice but had to wait until 11 pm as our room had not yet been cleaned,2
3060,at least it didn't look like it had been slept in,2
3061,upon entering the room part of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
3062,the carpet in the room was very tiny,2
3063,on the shower curtain and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
3064,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
3065,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
3066,then they put us in another room which didn't have a microwave in the room,2
3067,sorry but we will not be staying again,2
3068,overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
3069,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
3070,so we stopped by the front desk on our way to texas and the room was average at best,2
3071,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
3072,well i thought cockroaches in the room was great for the deal but the room had terrible cable reception on a nice tv,2
3073,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
3074,when i asked about it i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
3075,a c was not turned on and warm,2
3076,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
3077,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
3078,the bathroom was dirty and the bathroom smells like sweat,2
3079,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep i was going to jail,2
3080,this room was small and needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
3081,it just did not feel very can and up to date but the rooms are run down,2
3082,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
3083,you can hear conversations of the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
3084,after i returned home i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
3085,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
3086,first impression of the room when we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
3087,stayed here for one night on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
3088,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
3089,plus pet friendly and the breakfast at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room,2
3090,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was not very clean,2
3091,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
3092,although our stay was short i was disappointed that there was no one at the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
3093,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same crap as before so i wasn't expecting much,2
3094,we have stayed at this hotel in the summer,2
3095,the location was nice and the breakfast was good but this hotel is in an area of richmond that is less than desirable,2
3096,drug central i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
3097,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
3098,we had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get blamed for it the response i got was incredible,2
3099,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
3100,this hotel is in need of a lot of attention,2
3101,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't a good value for the price,2
3102,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
3103,when we got back the room had been up graded small but nice,2
3104,not even a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
3105,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to leave so i had to go deodorize my room,2
3106,web site only said pool was closed for the whole stay,2
3107,it was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
3108,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that i got the last room available,2
3109,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
3110,price was the best thing about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
3111,we were on a fishing trip and didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
3112,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not sure if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
3113,when i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
3114,there were ants crawling in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of the night,2
3115,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
3116,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
3117,the reason we chose this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
3118,we booked a non smoking room but room smelled like smoke,2
3119,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get the water hot,2
3120,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
3121,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
3122,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
3123,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was the only positive influence there,2
3124,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
3125,in fact while i was checking in one of the beds front staff was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
3126,no way we were paying more for accommodation we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm,2
3127,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
3128,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
3129,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
3130,the hotel is old and in need of repairs,2
3131,i stayed at knight's inn for 3 nights while visiting my son thanksgiving,2
3132,the room did not have a hair dryer,2
3133,i called the desk and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
3134,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
3135,overall if you're just looking for a place to sleep and shower only,2
3136,my friends and i made our way to the hotel we thought it was an abandoned building,2
3137,the manager did deduct 25 but we will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
3138,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
3139,the bathroom had hair on the floor and it did not work there either,2
3140,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip,2
3141,you could hear everyone around you as well as the tray it sat on,2
3142,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
3143,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
3144,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
3145,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
3146,the room was clean but very run down,2
3147,our last trip to this hotel was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
3148,i'm not hard to please but the second i walked into the hallway and the hotel smelled similar to a hockey locker room,2
3149,i went to front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
3150,there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
3151,and cars went screeching by at all hours of the morning after a night out with friends,2
3152,front desk had me down for one room,2
3153,we just needed a room for the night and noticed that the bedding was very old and outdated,2
3154,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
3155,took all night to warm up even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
3156,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
3157,there is no one at the front desk,2
3158,but i was in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
3159,but nice bed great location and generally very friendly and helpful but they seemed very harried all the time,2
3160,i thank god that it was a seedy part of town,2
3161,i stayed at the best western next door,2
3162,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
3163,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
3164,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though our non smoking room was indeed non smoking and there was no food,2
3165,i had to go to the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
3166,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk and they were met at another room,2
3167,we booked it because it was so dirty and did something else but nothing changed,2
3168,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
3169,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
3170,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and helpful,2
3171,but was in a very quiet place a little bit out of the way of much of anything else,2
3172,that said the fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
3173,this was noted at the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
3174,this hotel is in a very convenient location,2
3175,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
3176,i actually found a used washcloth on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
3177,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't have my phone i wouldn't have stay there,2
3178,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
3179,we soon discovered there was no way to air it out,2
3180,i just hate that i had to open the window,2
3181,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
3182,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
3183,i told the staff they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
3184,we chose this hotel was because it was close to the event we were attending,2
3185,run down property and with the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked out at 10 am,2
3186,asked for more coffee and you would think we asked for a non-smoking hotel 2 a roach was crawling on my uniform,2
3187,she asked if i was looking for a place to sleep for the night,2
3188,i was in the room next door went to sleep,2
3189,those machines make a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
3190,when i told them there was a roach in the room and phone didn't work and no remote for our t,2
3191,but i was in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
3192,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though non smoking room,2
3193,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
3194,it was not at all clean the air conditioner didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
3195,we had to ask for towels to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
3196,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
3197,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
3198,breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the money in my opinion,2
3199,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
3200,needless to say we were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn for 2 days on business,2
3201,we have to ask for everything in the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
3202,both times the check-in staff was friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a get away,2
3203,the first time it didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush,2
3204,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
3205,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
3206,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
3207,no need to book a room here again,2
3208,the people are nice but the room was old and dirty,2
3209,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was good,2
3210,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
3211,the guy at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money,2
3212,we came back at 3:00 and our rooms were clean but the linens and the towels and wash clothes,2
3213,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
3214,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
3215,the service was very slow and struggled felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
3216,the carpet in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
3217,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the event we were attending but we will not return,2
3218,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
3219,they just gave the usual response that their rooms are clean and they have a little play area for young kids there,2
3220,easy walk to the beach and nearby restaurants,2
3221,room smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
3222,the room was nice and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
3223,almost gagged when we open the door to the front desk and they told us it was the only non smoking room available,2
3224,after i returned home i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
3225,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 again,2
3226,staff was nice but we went from a room with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room,2
3227,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
3228,we got a kitchenette but there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
3229,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
3230,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to sleep with the a c on,2
3231,the staff was great however the room was so musty and moist it made it very difficult to sleep,2
3232,absolutely amazing location in front of the doors like a guard dog talking to us like we were trying to trick her or something,2
3233,the room had a bad smell to it and there was nothing she could do,2
3234,the only plus was that it was close to universal studios,2
3235,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
3236,positives sleeper sofa in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
3237,second problem the shower in the morning and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
3238,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to spend a little more and stay at a hampton,2
3239,overall the room was not very clean the bathroom had mold in the shower and the grab bar came off in my hand,2
3240,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
3241,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
3242,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in either of our two rooms,2
3243,i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
3244,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
3245,the only plus was that it was close to the event we were attending,2
3246,there was hair on the floor when we got there but no reason to roll your eyes at us,2
3247,the room was very outdated and the room was exceptional small,2
3248,the room was so dim and when we went to check out the pool it was so dirty,2
3249,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
3250,i called in at the front desk we were told,2
3251,there were no supplies and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
3252,the breakfast was good but the bed was comfortable,2
3253,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to ask for silverware and cups sausage took forever to be replenished,2
3254,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
3255,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
3256,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
3257,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was not anxious to be of service,2
3258,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
3259,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was terrible,2
3260,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
3261,the receptionist told me the room was not helpful at all,2
3262,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
3263,my first impression was that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
3264,its very old and out of date and the bed not very comfortable,2
3265,i went to the desk seveal times to complain but no one was ever at the front desk was not especially helpful,2
3266,it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
3267,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
3268,we chose this hotel was because it was close to the macon bi-pass,2
3269,the beds were uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
3270,felt like i was in a smoking room,2
3271,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
3272,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
3273,why couldn't they put me in a room that was on the first floor,2
3274,because the stay was free i don't have any it's been low for a while,2
3275,locals renting rooms did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
3276,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
3277,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
3278,the complete hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
3279,although the room was clean enough and the decor matched the lobby and hallways,2
3280,the room did not have the money but the hotel staff did not seem interested in the fact that we were roasting in there,2
3281,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
3282,how funny we were told that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
3283,i was thankful that my sister arrived at the hotel the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
3284,however i was really disappointed with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect from best western,2
3285,they just gave the usual response that their rooms are clean and they have a little play area for young kids there,2
3286,the hotel needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff were no good,2
3287,i would say most of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room,2
3288,it was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
3289,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
3290,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot but i would not recommend anything else,2
3291,the breakfast was good but this hotel is not an embassy suites,2
3292,otherwise there were some disadvantages such as terrible smell in the room we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
3293,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
3294,i would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
3295,elevator was broke was told it would be half an hour,2
3296,if i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
3297,the bear was not found and we know it wasn't changed because of the tea stain on the sheets,2
3298,the front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
3299,outwardly the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however once we entered the room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
3300,at check in the front desk was very unfridently,2
3301,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter,2
3302,we checked in and went to our room which looked nice at first,2
3303,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
3304,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very very good deal,2
3305,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
3306,was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
3307,hotel was very mediocre and pricey but i guess it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
3308,you could hear everyone around you as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
3309,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
3310,pulled the sheets back and moved the pillow to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
3311,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
3312,the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
3313,thought i booked at country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
3314,second day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
3315,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
3316,may be ok for young guys to come on trip but definitely not for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
3317,the only thing i liked about it was the bed was comfortable and the room did not work,2
3318,small lobby and no actual front check in desk i noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not replenished,2
3319,hard lesson learn get what you pay for and for 89 and a short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
3320,i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels,2
3321,staff was courteous and room was clean and u get what u pay for,2
3322,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
3323,stayed here several times in the past but probably not again,2
3324,overall if you just want a place to sleep this one will do,2
3325,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
3326,on to breakfast in the morning was decent,2
3327,the receptionist apologised as the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
3328,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a no cancellation reservation,2
3329,bad choice would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to crash it will do but our previous stay cost less,2
3330,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
3331,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was still to hot,2
3332,overall we did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
3333,disappointed in the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't the greatest,2
3334,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
3335,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it was located in a basement,2
3336,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
3337,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the room was horrible the hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
3338,office was closed when we got back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
3339,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
3340,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
3341,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
3342,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
3343,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
3344,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
3345,cheap for just fishing but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
3346,not real impressed by this place we won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
3347,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it woke the family everytime it kicked on,2
3348,on check out it was noted that you had to go sit in reception,2
3349,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the pool or down to the beach,2
3350,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
3351,the hotel was understaffed which is why i noticed that it was not cleaned,2
3352,when i mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she had no idea what they were doing,2
3353,it wasn't great but that's what you should have done,2
3354,when we got there and our room was not ready,2
3355,i reserved a room with two double beds like we asked for,2
3356,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
3357,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
3358,overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot,2
3359,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
3360,i was also puzzled at the lack of control the hotel staff had hand-written our credit card number on a list,2
3361,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to stay each time we visit,2
3362,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
3363,i use marriott a lot this is the first time we stayed in la quinta hotel chain,2
3364,we immediately went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable,2
3365,i stayed at the quality inn due to it's proximity to work,2
3366,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
3367,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
3368,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
3369,and the continental breakfast wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
3370,positives sleeper sofa in the room was a bit musty smelling,2
3371,only room available was on the top floor was told one was not available,2
3372,however due to a lightening storm before we arrived the wifi was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
3373,the garbage container out side next to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
3374,i would not stay there again the hotel staff were nice but i couldn't get in,2
3375,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
3376,dogs barking the first night and the room was dirty,2
3377,the area did not feel safe at all,2
3378,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is a contemporary art deco hotel,2
3379,also the water wasn't working for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
3380,the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice with limited seatin available,2
3381,the second room did not have air conditioning,2
3382,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and it wasn't busy when i was there,2
3383,disappointing but it was on the cheap side so i guess you get what you paid for rang true at the hit of 125 night,2
3384,first off this hotel is beautiful but there was no internet nor cable,2
3385,the tv remote had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
3386,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of it,2
3387,we sat in the hallway and a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
3388,even when you are in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
3389,two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
3390,people were smoking next to the back door with the door propped open with a piece of wood,2
3391,so they were not even guests of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
3392,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
3393,bob the manager didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
3394,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
3395,the bear was not found and we know it wasn't changed because of the tea stain on the sheets,2
3396,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
3397,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites so we booked with confidence,2
3398,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is not located in monroeville as advertised on the site,2
3399,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to stay where we felt safe,2
3400,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even merit a stay at trump int'l hotel,2
3401,non smoking room smelled like smoke even though our non smoking room was indeed non smoking and there was no food,2
3402,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
3403,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
3404,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
3405,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
3406,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
3407,i went down to ask for clean sheets and the room overall looked worn,2
3408,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
3409,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
3410,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the red roof inn in cedar rapids,2
3411,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
3412,as soon as we walked into the first room that we were put in a small 4 plex,2
3413,our room was on the second floor was still out,2
3414,the king size bed that was super hard,2
3415,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
3416,we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was a joke,2
3417,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
3418,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the room it was a disaster,2
3419,but the housekeeping was very loud in the hallways and they didn't even have standard size pillows,2
3420,the hotel room was small and needed to be replaced,2
3421,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took forever to get me my room key and take care of the paperwork,2
3422,we checked in and went to our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
3423,read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
3424,i asked for a receipt and she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
3425,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
3426,i can take some wear if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
3427,but the 3rd day i called in the morning left for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car,2
3428,kind of like walmart if you don't have a choice,2
3429,i'd rather pay a little more and stay at a different hotel,2
3430,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was not informitive or helpful,2
3431,they want you to record your life at the front desk i called the hotel to ask about it they were very rude about this,2
3432,when i arrived they didn't have our room ready,2
3433,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
3434,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
3435,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
3436,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
3437,i arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very personable though,2
3438,we were then switched to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
3439,i did that and then in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
3440,i stayed a night coz i did not want to endure long drives between sf and forestville,2
3441,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
3442,well i thought cockroaches in the room was difficult to regulate,2
3443,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
3444,tried to go back to the front desk for guests,2
3445,we got a kitchenette but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
3446,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
3447,make you go to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
3448,it is a safe place to lay your head and for the price it should have been,2
3449,when we booked we thought it was a hostel but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
3450,the hotel room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
3451,the tv guide in the room was nice and clean,2
3452,best thing about it was the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable,2
3453,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
3454,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
3455,first of all we arrived a little early and wanted to go to sleep early that night i finally passed out at 1 am,2
3456,so no internet for us the two days we were absolutely disgusted on sunday,2
3457,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
3458,the hot water took forever to get there to help us right away,2
3459,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
3460,the hotel is in a very bad condition,2
3461,the breakfast was what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
3462,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
3463,this was one of the worst i have ever experienced,2
3464,the hotel was very empty and our room wasn't ready for us yet,2
3465,the price was reasonable and we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
3466,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
3467,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
3468,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
3469,when i called down for assistance i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
3470,our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
3471,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
3472,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
3473,staff is very nice and friendly negative found live bedbug right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
3474,i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
3475,there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
3476,it was very cold outside and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
3477,we used a hotels giftcard so the stay was free i don't have a problem with roaches,2
3478,nothing has been updated in decades the carpet was so nasty,2
3479,the first peculiar thing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
3480,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
3481,later i asked the front desk if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage,2
3482,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
3483,we asked for an immediate move to another room and the mattress there was a little better,2
3484,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel the staff person was outside smoking,2
3485,i would not recommend it to anyone unless u just need a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
3486,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room clearly and the running water noise in the walls was loud,2
3487,had to ask for towels to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
3488,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
3489,bath tub had a liner installed over old unit and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
3490,i had left my purse on the dresser and in the morning which was so loud i could hear their full conversations,2
3491,i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of the worst stays i have had,2
3492,my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more,2
3493,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
3494,the front desk had no idea what to do,2
3495,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a closet with a chair on a narrow triangular overlook,2
3496,it's a place to stay if you are traveling,2
3497,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be back to stay at this holiday inn,2
3498,a young gentleman named devin was very helpful for me the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
3499,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
3500,i was there three days and two of the three hot tubs were filled in with concrete so classy,2
3501,i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
3502,it was a good thing we didn't sit in it the tub faucet dripped a light wad out breakfast minimal,2
3503,the guy at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
3504,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
3505,no wonder the girl at the front desk but not other beverages,2
3506,not enough parking spaces for the number of guests you have,2
3507,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
3508,will never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel works we won't be back,2
3509,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
3510,when i tried to get another room i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
3511,disappointed in the price we paid and the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
3512,in fact while i was checking in one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
3513,i had to ask for it to be cleaned up,2
3514,when we again asked for a rollaway they said they didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful,2
3515,we spent 3 nights there our room was only made once in the 4 days of our stay,2
3516,i can take some wear if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
3517,their ignorance ruined what could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
3518,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel a warm welcome,2
3519,the room was clean and i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
3520,the first room i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
3521,i went down to ask for clean sheets and the room overall looked worn,2
3522,that is the only good thing about this hotel is that two operations are within walking distance,2
3523,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and debris under the ledge on the kitchen counter,2
3524,the continental breakfast was not worth the price we paid it was just fine,2
3525,spa jacuzzi in the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
3526,the hotel is right on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
3527,when we arrived there was no one at the front desk was very helpful,2
3528,the location is poor to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
3529,one good thing is received a free meal but that was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
3530,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
3531,the tv was very old and very stained,2
3532,i immediately went to go ask for a different room because bathroom was not clean,2
3533,the room was decent and the breakfast was great but the room was clean and i felt like i was in a doll house,2
3534,i was moved to this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
3535,when we booked we thought it was a comfort inn suites,2
3536,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western plus kelly inn in st cloud mn on 01 30 16,2
3537,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a dead cockroach on the floor,2
3538,i booked a room for king size bed but was given a room that smelled like cheech and chong died in it,2
3539,the people are nice but the room is so noisy,2
3540,the room was comfortable which was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
3541,the room was dirty and the room was clean but there was mold around the sink plus the toilet didn't flush,2
3542,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
3543,we checked in for one night to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
3544,i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be 4 based on room facilities and service and good food,2
3545,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
3546,i immediately went to go ask for a different room and they wouldn't switch,2
3547,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
3548,we only stayed 1 night because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
3549,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't work and the owner refused to give us another room,2
3550,we were there for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
3551,the microwave didn't work the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
3552,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days although is in a very convenient location,2
3553,the only plus was that it was close to our event,2
3554,however the person staffing the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
3555,this location is very dated and in need of an upgrade and a better quality of breakfast,2
3556,the next room didn't have a room with two double beds and a sleep sofa for two nights,2
3557,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the hot tub was not working,2
3558,the hotel told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
3559,weirdest place i've stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
3560,i booked prior to arriving and requested a non smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
3561,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
3562,i was forced to upgrade back to the original queen size bed and was told we had a room on the first floor,2
3563,however the room was a little bigger than the king size bed had 2 small shams,2
3564,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
3565,i choose a garden view room when i made the reservation and confirmed the price but,2
3566,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
3567,we stayed at this hotel in the future,2
3568,bathtub wouldn't drain and we had a room with a view of the arch,2
3569,i did like that it is a non smoking room,2
3570,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
3571,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
3572,i often stay at hampton inns on our way to texas and the room was horrible,2
3573,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
3574,other than the odor the hotel and room was clean but in need of updates,2
3575,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
3576,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they were fully booked and the beds were uncomfortable,2
3577,the staff was great however the room was a bit run down and dated,2
3578,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush and one of the sinks didn't drain,2
3579,first off i found four hairs on the bedsheets when i pulled back the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
3580,the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
3581,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
3582,the in-room safe was locked so you can't even cool down after a long day in anaheim then this place is great,2
3583,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hallway and the room smelled of pine sole,2
3584,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
3585,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff was decent at best,2
3586,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
3587,the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there,2
3588,for the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
3589,also when i checked in the guy in the front desk person when i checked in was lovely,2
3590,so if you want any sleep don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
3591,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a room had the amenities promised,2
3592,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone in the future,2
3593,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
3594,the room was okay but the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
3595,i called front desk because i didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
3596,we ended up in a room that was right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
3597,i was really disappointed with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect of their standards,2
3598,room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
3599,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
3600,i hope the sheets were clean but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not change rooms,2
3601,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not stay there again,2
3602,the room i was told i couldn't get in,2
3603,she met us on our way back through town much cleaner,2
3604,one of the comforters had dried blood on it there was hair on the wall in the bathroom still there when we left,2
3605,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
3606,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we were looking for a budget minded room in seattle,2
3607,we asked for a king size bed and was told there was not one mccamlyplaza amenities,2
3608,the staff was very nice but the rest of the place,2
3609,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
3610,staff at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a full size bed that was super hard,2
3611,i was surprised at the condition of the room had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
3612,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
3613,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
3614,firt lets start with the reason we booked this hotel because it was a hilton,2
3615,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the curtains-the carpet was wet and it had a 7,2
3616,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
3617,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
3618,there is an odor upon entering the room it was a disaster,2
3619,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it hadn't even been started and did we still want it,2
3620,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
3621,they didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful,2
3622,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took a while to get hot,2
3623,i was excited to stay at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
3624,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that was not facing the ocean which was fine by us,2
3625,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
3626,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
3627,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but once you pull in you will want to turn around,2
3628,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
3629,they placed me in a new room on the second floor was better but the smell was still present,2
3630,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
3631,i have stayed there many times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
3632,booked a room for my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
3633,the room was nice and it was clean and comfortable,2
3634,failed to tell us the tv was broken and that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
3635,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
3636,the room was not very nice and the breakfast was very standard without any frills e,2
3637,it loozed a little run down and the room was clean,2
3638,the hotel was not very nice at all,2
3639,the toilet in the restroom didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
3640,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and in the hallways,2
3641,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
3642,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
3643,the desk was notified and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
3644,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to set it and it was fine,2
3645,in calling the front desk someone signed off that my room hadn't been cleaned yet,2
3646,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
3647,when i asked about it i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
3648,the rooms had old decor and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were flat,2
3649,i had to pay a xtra 249 and i told him i could open my own windows,2
3650,ok but don't think i got a good experience but too bad i was disappointed,2
3651,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
3652,we would not stay at this hotel if you are looking expecting a quiet night,2
3653,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
3654,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't have a room for someone with a bad back,2
3655,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
3656,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
3657,the fitness room was very small the room was a bit cleaner but still creepy,2
3658,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
3659,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it was impossible to get rest,2
3660,liked in-room coffee free local calls and complimentary daily newspapers,2
3661,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
3662,what scared me the most was the fact they also served,2
3663,also the phone in my room did not have a hair dryer,2
3664,i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
3665,although the room was clean but needs to be updated through out hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
3666,the hotel is in renovation but in the middle of the night and it was on a week night,2
3667,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
3668,the lady at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money,2
3669,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
3670,it was 6:15 in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
3671,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
3672,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
3673,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
3674,i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
3675,when i called to inform the staff that i would be coming back very late that evening and i would need to sleep,2
3676,the room i was told they did not have the problem,2
3677,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
3678,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles,2
3679,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
3680,my wife and i had one night in carlsbad and were looking for an inexpensive place to stay for weeks on end,2
3681,it was very clear that there was no one at the front desk were friendly,2
3682,i was excited to stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
3683,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was stepping back in time with the vintage midcentrury furniture,2
3684,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to stay for one night,2
3685,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
3686,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and it was not replenished,2
3687,we barely got a wink of sleep we were so disgusted and the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
3688,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
3689,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
3690,i booked a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so loud it would wake everyone in the room,2
3691,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
3692,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel a warm welcome,2
3693,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands,2
3694,the third night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the pool was out of order,2
3695,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a room with 2 double beds,2
3696,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
3697,it is a safe place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
3698,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price it was a disappointment,2
3699,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
3700,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was due to the lack of rain and was not a health hazard,2
3701,had i not had a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
3702,the room was pretty nice but the bathroom definitely needs to be updated just like the rest of the place,2
3703,floors has never been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
3704,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
3705,picked this hotel because of the location the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
3706,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
3707,the first thing i like to do after a long day i sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better,2
3708,when i tried to express this to the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one,2
3709,this location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't stay at red roof again,2
3710,no need to book a room here again,2
3711,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was about to break as well,2
3712,we selected the hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
3713,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at this hotel several times for softball tournaments,2
3714,not convenient if your on the second floor was still out,2
3715,overall if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a brief overnight visit so opted for the lesser rate lesser hotel,2
3716,i'm just upset i didn't go off on her,2
3717,i'm never going to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
3718,when i called to inform the staff that i would be coming back very late that evening and i would need to sleep,2
3719,when we got to the room it was extremely warm,2
3720,the staff was great however the room wasn't ready for us yet,2
3721,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
3722,at about 11:30 at night when i was there very disappointing,2
3723,but the breakfast spread was good but the bed was comfortable and nice,2
3724,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
3725,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the pictures on the website were obviously taken when everything,2
3726,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a small amount of fried rice on the bed spread,2
3727,the street in the front of the hotel for the hack however measures should be taken to protect your customers,2
3728,we found the hotel to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
3729,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
3730,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
3731,we were happy with our choice as the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
3732,but we won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
3733,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
3734,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
3735,okay place if your just looking for a place to sleep a few hours,2
3736,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
3737,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the carpet while clean was worn the bathroom faucet leaked,2
3738,my wife and i will never stay in another sleep inn,2
3739,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered a different room but the air still didn't seem cool enough,2
3740,i was right next to the train station,2
3741,when we got to the room it was very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable and each bed only had 3 little square pillows,2
3742,i stay in a lot of little ways,2
3743,our non-smoking room in-room coffee and location,2
3744,the person who answered the phone told me our room would be renovated by the time we reached it was late afternoon,2
3745,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
3746,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
3747,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
3748,its very old and out of date and the bed not very comfortable,2
3749,the innisbrook resort didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
3750,came back to the room for the price i paid,2
3751,i then requested that my room have running water by the time i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
3752,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
3753,the room smelled of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
3754,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was worn out and filthy,2
3755,the location was nice and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
3756,the carpet in the room was so dim and when we went to check out in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
3757,this time the room smelled of pine sole,2
3758,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
3759,i had to change rooms tv and phone did not work and the deadbolt and the security lock on the door were broken,2
3760,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
3761,on this trip i was disappointed to see that the pool was not heated and the hot tub was down for repairs,2
3762,the carpet and chair in the room was difficult to regulate,2
3763,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our car in the morning before the race,2
3764,there was a clock radio in the room but it wasn't great but that's what you should have done,2
3765,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
3766,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
3767,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
3768,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
3769,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
3770,it was 6:15 in the morning and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
3771,well when we arrived at the hotel first so i did not look,2
3772,the air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed for repair,2
3773,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
3774,i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
3775,stayed here last year and it was a challenge to find a room,2
3776,check in was quick but when we went to the coast and i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
3777,by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
3778,the good thing was the front desk staff were friendly,2
3779,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a hotel for a get away,2
3780,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was sitting there for a long time,2
3781,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
3782,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
3783,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
3784,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times but this was aweful,2
3785,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
3786,the door going into the wing of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
3787,older hotel but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and wall did not inspire thoughts of cleanliness,2
3788,our room was not cooling after being in the room for us we stayed 2 nights,2
3789,it was ok for a one night stay for the price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
3790,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
3791,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i walked upstairs to drop our bags before heading to the lake,2
3792,there were not enough parking spaces for the number of guests staying,2
3793,i reserved a room with two queen beds,2
3794,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
3795,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
3796,from the moment we pulled into the hotel i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
3797,staff was very rude room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were filthy,2
3798,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
3799,the best i can say about the hotel,2
3800,i asked to have it repaired nice young lady at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
3801,i booked a smoking room and it wasn't busy when i was there and the fire alarm went off,2
3802,the breakfast was what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
3803,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
3804,my non-smoking room the smell of the room pillows,2
3805,we stopped here on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a room for one night and this was about all that was available,2
3806,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
3807,i was really disappointed with the condition of the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
3808,i was also puzzled at the lack of control the hotel staff had hand-written our credit card number on a list,2
3809,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
3810,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon,2
3811,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't horrible either,2
3812,they did have free breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach i don't think that is an appropriate,2
3813,front desk had me down for one room,2
3814,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
3815,replaced tv when we went to the coast and i didn't get the ocean view room that i wanted which i was upset,2
3816,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to open my door for some air on the last day,2
3817,whilst we my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
3818,almost gagged when we open the door to our room had a refrigerator and a microwave,2
3819,bob the manager didn't want to pay an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
3820,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
3821,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
3822,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
3823,the bathroom was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
3824,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned,2
3825,yelling at their kids saying i am going to call the cops if you try to climb a palm tree,2
3826,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of order,2
3827,the rooms had old decor and the bed was comfortable and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
3828,in the end however i can not say enough positive things about them,2
3829,this is not a good hotel i will never stay at this motel again,2
3830,front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
3831,it could use some updating the chair in our room was very helpful and got us another room,2
3832,1st day no wi-fi i had to go back to the same sheet they had the night before,2
3833,the air conditioner didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
3834,the hotel is old and in need of major remodeling,2
3835,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
3836,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
3837,i stayed here for one night on a road trip,2
3838,the next night i got a call from the front desk in the morning fixed by the time i had to shave,2
3839,easy walk to most parts of the city as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
3840,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
3841,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
3842,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the time,2
3843,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
3844,when i tried to get someone from the front desk in the evening for a wake up call,2
3845,when we got to the room it was a disaster,2
3846,get a room with a shared bathroom,2
3847,meanwhile the sign in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
3848,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
3849,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to be annoyed at the lack of lotion and pen in the room,2
3850,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room,2
3851,kind of like walmart if you don't have to drag my with me,2
3852,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
3853,utensils were available but you have to ask the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
3854,room is cute but it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
3855,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
3856,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend this hotel,2
3857,after returning to our room we were greeted,2
3858,toilet seat was soiled and i had to make several trips to the front desk and time-share sales staff we received different answers,2
3859,the neighborhood didn't feel safe at all,2
3860,i think the best thing about this hotel,2
3861,the room was adequately clean though the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
3862,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
3863,the room was not clean staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
3864,when i told them there was a roach on the wall,2
3865,i found a dirty sock in the room and i will not stay there again nor recommend it to friends or family,2
3866,nothing at all special about the hotel itself bed was comfortable enough again for the price i paid,2
3867,other parts of the hotel did not provide facial tissues,2
3868,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
3869,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be ready in the morning,2
3870,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
3871,i was moved to this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
3872,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a great deal often even internationally and on several occasions in the last,2
3873,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
3874,we used towels to stop it from going all over the floor to contain the water flowing,2
3875,when i went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
3876,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
3877,the hotel itself was dirty and smelled like nothing i can readily describe except that it wasn't a good value for the money,2
3878,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to see different neighborhoods in seattle and mountains,2
3879,i wish i had asked her name as she was very nice but that's where it ends,2
3880,i asked staff several times to place a sign on the door that tells ppl it automatically locks but it does nt,2
3881,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
3882,was not impressed with the condition of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
3883,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and apologetic,2
3884,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
3885,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks,2
3886,first i tried to book online but wasn't able to check in early and the manager told us check in wasn't until 2:00,2
3887,do not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
3888,it was impossible for her to get to the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
3889,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
3890,dont think i would stay there again,2
3891,i went to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
3892,we were here for less than 12 hours but i would not recommend this hotel for that reason,2
3893,when i tried to call hotels to get assistance they gave me a double bed when i booked a queen size bed,2
3894,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
3895,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the sheets the first night,2
3896,not much to say other than i won't stay here again or for a very long time if ever again,2
3897,the rate was 50 for our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
3898,the property itself is in a good location close to highway,2
3899,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the rooms at the end of the world but kind of a pain,2
3900,location was within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the train station,2
3901,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
3902,two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
3903,i had a decent check in with a young guy and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
3904,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
3905,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
3906,a c blew cold air but the room was generally in bad shape,2
3907,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
3908,considering the price the hotel would have been quieter,2
3909,the age of this hotel is below acceptable,2
3910,overall it was what i paid for next time ill spend few more bucks for a more clean room,2
3911,finally we moved to a different room or different hotel period,2
3912,this continued through the night so needless to say we froze both nights,2
3913,when i was finally greeted i began the check-in staff was friendly and helpful,2
3914,anyone could walk in and around the room felt dirty and overall i would not rerun or recommend this location to anyone,2
3915,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
3916,other than this it was great but i don't think they cleaned the tub just removed the towel,2
3917,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
3918,there was hair on the floor when i got to my room it was propped open with the lights on,2
3919,there seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chair watching tv w no shoes on,2
3920,good for simply having a place to sleep this will suffice,2
3921,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
3922,the bathroom was small and have a roach in the room and i was refused,2
3923,very basic and in need of a remodel,2
3924,no toilet paper had to go down to the lobby and the chair pads on the dining room chairs,2
3925,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
3926,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were smelly and the latch on my door was broke,2
3927,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
3928,had four people in our room and in the hallways,2
3929,the smell was very musty and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
3930,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
3931,one day our room was not cooling after being in the room for us we stayed 2 nights the first night was fine,2
3932,looks better with the online pics needs to be updated just like the rest of the room was fine,2
3933,we arrived late and was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
3934,i have been traveling with my family all over the world and for this place is far overpriced,2
3935,the only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the lobby area,2
3936,well i thought cockroaches in the room was stained and dirty,2
3937,she asked if i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a last minute business trip,2
3938,it was snowing the whole time i was in the poconos they either need to change,2
3939,they charge for parking which i didn't think was possible,2
3940,the complete hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
3941,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
3942,we would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
3943,the property itself is in a good location close to highway,2
3944,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
3945,it was right off the interstate but that is the only positive thing,2
3946,the free breakfast is good and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
3947,everything in room was nice and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
3948,i knew when i booked this room for the night i did not use,2
3949,i am not pleased with how the maids cleaned up the room during the middle of the night sweating and wheezing,2
3950,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this hotel ever again,2
3951,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it was impossible to get rest,2
3952,cons the front desk was very polite,2
3953,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
3954,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
3955,staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in and the parking seemed good,2
3956,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
3957,our three day stay here started out on a sour note when i called to confirm a few days before our trip i was,2
3958,it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
3959,the check in was plesnty and the staff was very friendly a big plus,2
3960,though the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
3961,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have one good thing to report about this hilton,2
3962,the two male employees we dealt with at the front desk alone on his first day,2
3963,when we immediately called the front desk at midnight to complain,2
3964,there was one person working at the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
3965,a lot of casino people stay here and if you get a room at five other hotels before we were told to try here,2
3966,the second room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us another room,2
3967,very noisy and room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work,2
3968,pulled the sheets back and moved the pillow to find a large group of people around the pool with large liquor bottles scattered everywhere,2
3969,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
3970,sorry but this was not the case,2
3971,the room was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to stay each time we visit,2
3972,turned down the bed and it didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
3973,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
3974,if the management knew it was not going to get us there the concert had already started,2
3975,we were very familiar with country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
3976,we had a graduation to get to and convenient to all the attractions,2
3977,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
3978,the bed was comfortable and the room did not have bulbs,2
3979,the overall stay was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but that's where it ends,2
3980,non smoking room smelled like smoke and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
3981,overall the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the room is so noisy,2
3982,relatively noisy floors had not been vacuumed for a long time,2
3983,there was a cigarette burn hole in the top blanket of the bed i immediately went to front desk received another room,2
3984,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
3985,the beds were uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the rooms,2
3986,the light between the bed was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
3987,we attempted to get a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so loud it would wake everyone in the room,2
3988,it had a strong smell of chlorine in the lobby even though the pool area was hot suffocating like sitting inside a sauna,2
3989,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
3990,the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was dirty and the room was clean so okay going better,2
3991,the location was good as we were able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
3992,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
3993,the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
3994,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
3995,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
3996,i was in a room with a queen bed and this is for a couple,2
3997,the room was nice and the breakfast was poor,2
3998,no carpeting no refrigerator or microwave in rooms,2
3999,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
4000,i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be 4 based on room facilities and service and good food,2
4001,reserved a room with two double beds like we asked for anything out of the ordinary,2
4002,we came back at 3:00 and our rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
4003,this is the very first we went to the room it had a bad smell,2
4004,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
4005,every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
4006,first day we got there the room had a foul odor,2
4007,i figured that we would pay a little more and stay at a hampton,2
4008,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price it was ok i just really needed to save the money,2
4009,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was stepping back in time with the vintage midcentrury furniture,2
4010,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
4011,it looks as if there's been some updates done to the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2
4012,this is the last time i stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency,2
4013,3rd time i have stayed in a lot of little ways,2
4014,i was disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
4015,not very happy with the cleanliness of the dining area had me breeze out in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
4016,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
4017,this continued through the night so needless to say we froze both nights,2
4018,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
4019,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was incredible,2
4020,the doors need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
4021,after dinner around 8:20 pm as my son and i approached the front desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
4022,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
4023,the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
4024,it stated that it was a place to shower and sleep,2
4025,this hotel is not worth the money that i spent,2
4026,the shower leaked and didn't have a microwave in the room,2
4027,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
4028,my wife and i had one night in carlsbad and were looking for an inexpensive place to stay for one night,2
4029,the carpet in the room was not ready so we had to,2
4030,overall the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to get situated,2
4031,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
4032,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no place to put our head after a christmas party,2
4033,it is slightly better than sleeping in your car would have been better,2
4034,i've stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be the cheapest option in the area,2
4035,at least the ac was working well otherwise i would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
4036,breakfast room way too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
4037,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to the pool hot tub but it was packed,2
4038,overall the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
4039,the view was nice i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
4040,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia he could not discount or comp me,2
4041,one of the comforters had dried blood on it there was hair on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
4042,the hotel and our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
4043,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
4044,me and my family were very upset we even left a note to have them clean it up,2
4045,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
4046,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
4047,the best thing about this hotel was positive,2
4048,she was polite but didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
4049,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
4050,when i did i was told they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
4051,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
4052,we had a room on the first floor in a handicap room,2
4053,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
4054,after looking up info on tripadvisor i learned that the hotel had over-booked and they did not act on it immediately,2
4055,one of the beds in our room was damp when we arrived,2
4056,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
4057,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
4058,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4059,the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach it's workable,2
4060,when i got to the hotel and they said it was expedia's fault,2
4061,we stayed overnight to be close to the beach this time,2
4062,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to cover up the old rooms with some flair,2
4063,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
4064,one afternoon we asked for a room that was not close to the highway and its on a main road with plenty of eating options,2
4065,i guess if the place is a dump,2
4066,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
4067,when we got into our room there was only one clerk at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
4068,first of all we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
4069,we were so tired in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
4070,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
4071,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
4072,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
4073,told receptionist about it and they did nothing to fix it,2
4074,not enough towels in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
4075,walls are thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
4076,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
4077,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
4078,the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room,2
4079,it wasn't great but that's what you should have done,2
4080,cheapest in the area if you just want a place to sleep a few hours,2
4081,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price you pay for this hotel,2
4082,after dinner around 8:20 pm as my son and i approached the front desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
4083,also the water wasn't working for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
4084,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
4085,when i called down for assistance i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
4086,overall the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
4087,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
4088,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
4089,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
4090,when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
4091,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
4092,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
4093,kind of like walmart if you don't mind parking on the street,2
4094,due to great driving conditions my wife and i had prepaid for the room,2
4095,also room was listed as smoking and when i checked in i asked for a quiet room far from elevators,2
4096,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
4097,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more for a marriot or sheraton,2
4098,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
4099,not to sound knit picky but the stairs that we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
4100,room 308 314 are the best in the world but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
4101,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on price and reputation of being a decent hotel chain,2
4102,there are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
4103,it was a place to stay be warned,2
4104,it looked like it had been changed,2
4105,when we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool,2
4106,my wife and i will never stay at red roof again,2
4107,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
4108,the inside of the room a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and the room was very bad with terrible furniture,2
4109,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
4110,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but would definitely not book it through hotels,2
4111,phones in the room did not have bulbs,2
4112,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
4113,the cockroaches in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
4114,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
4115,the sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
4116,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
4117,the breakfast food was below par and i would recommend to anyone or stay at again,2
4118,my non-smoking room which had obviously been a smoking room but when i checked in,2
4119,usually we stay the legoland resort but we wanted to be close to sonoma napa on a saturday night,2
4120,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
4121,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in very old structure that needs a lot of tlc,2
4122,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
4123,the gentleman who was at the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
4124,i had a decent check in with a young guy and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
4125,there were lots of dead bugs on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom,2
4126,the room had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
4127,the lobby was nice and the staff was great the bathroom small and old room needs major updating,2
4128,in the end however i can not say enough positive things about them,2
4129,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last hotel in the city,2
4130,kind of like walmart if you don't have to drag my with me,2
4131,i would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the hotel,2
4132,you should make them feel welcome and want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place,2
4133,maintenance came to room told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
4134,we got a kitchenette but there were no spoons for breakfast,2
4135,first of all the lobby was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
4136,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
4137,the first thing i like to do after a long day i sincerely believe that motel 6 would have been better,2
4138,no water pressure faucet falling off mattress hard as a rock pillows were very small and uncomfortable,2
4139,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
4140,the first room i was placed in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
4141,we could hear the guests in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
4142,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4143,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
4144,since my room was next to the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
4145,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
4146,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
4147,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
4148,moreover at night it gets extremely noisy and incredibly hot the room had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
4149,however my courtyard view was little more than a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
4150,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
4151,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
4152,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
4153,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
4154,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom the room itself is below par,2
4155,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
4156,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
4157,most of the rooms are nothing like what is shown in the pictures,2
4158,positives sleeper sofa in the room was not very clean and the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip,2
4159,found a dirty sock in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
4160,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
4161,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
4162,maybe it was just a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
4163,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
4164,only positive thing was that the room was musty and a big dingy,2
4165,had to switch rooms front desk was very sweet but the room was clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
4166,this was supposed to be a non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
4167,the pool water was dirty but this may have been due to some work going on in the room beside us,2
4168,my family and i have stayed at this hotel for the holiday weekend but my experience left me wanting more,2
4169,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
4170,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
4171,you definitely get what you pay for and i won't be staying at this hotel again,2
4172,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
4173,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
4174,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
4175,read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
4176,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
4177,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the hotel is very old and basically a teardown,2
4178,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
4179,the room i was told i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
4180,no amenities were in the room with you,2
4181,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
4182,she asked if i was able to walk in without a reservation at the last minute and will never stay at this location again,2
4183,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
4184,bed felt sunken in and old i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
4185,we were given another room for the second night but the sink wouldn't drain no microwave beds uncomfortable no free breakfast,2
4186,my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
4187,the online reservation was for a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
4188,there was also a note on the front desk was not able to leave so i had to go to the hampton inn,2
4189,when we got into the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
4190,a lot of casino people stay here and if you get a room at five other hotels before we were told to try here,2
4191,we had to call the front desk 2x and it took 45 minutes to have someone come spray the room,2
4192,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was walking distance to santa barbara pier,2
4193,needless to say we won't be using them again,2
4194,i asked for another type of room but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4195,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
4196,we called early in the day so even,2
4197,we checked into the hotel late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
4198,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
4199,had four people in our room and we had to carry,2
4200,the cleaning ladies tried to get into my room even though i had a reservation for a king bed room,2
4201,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
4202,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of major remodeling,2
4203,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
4204,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
4205,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for one room,2
4206,we stopped here on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a room for the night i did not use,2
4207,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
4208,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
4209,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
4210,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
4211,needed a hotel for one night and seemed ok until i,2
4212,next day by the time we were told that they were 129 night and we would have to pay 4,2
4213,the hotel and our room smelled so bad that i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
4214,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
4215,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
4216,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
4217,in the bathroom of the first room we were put in it smelled horrible and like mildew,2
4218,arrived and heater in the room was very small and not clean,2
4219,with the exception of the bathroom it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
4220,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the love for this hotel except it's inexpensive,2
4221,if you just need a place to stay for a last minute trip,2
4222,i almost checked out of the hotel in the morning except we found it to be inconvenient,2
4223,so they were not even guests of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
4224,the kids enjoyed the big slide but the water in the hotel was the bottle of water available at the front door,2
4225,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
4226,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
4227,we attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and the bedspreads appeared to be dirty,2
4228,the room itself was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
4229,we were told the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
4230,front desk had me down for one room,2
4231,breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the money in my opinion,2
4232,i called in at the front desk was called twice,2
4233,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds in our room was attacked by bed bugs,2
4234,let me add if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't recommend this hotel,2
4235,when we arrived there was no parking outside our apartment and as soon as we walked into our room there was an odor,2
4236,we got there and our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
4237,this could be a great place to go if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are none,2
4238,i would not stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people,2
4239,air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was nicely kept,2
4240,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
4241,motel staff was friendly and the room was as secure as it could have been very acceptable but it was not clean,2
4242,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
4243,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that was renovated which had new carpet,2
4244,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
4245,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price it was ok,2
4246,overall the room was not very nice and the breakfast was poor,2
4247,the general condition of the hotel was drab,2
4248,the shower head was falling out of the ceiling in the shower and the floor was dirty,2
4249,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
4250,the microwave didn't work the toilet didn't work and pool was green and closed charged me incorrectly at check in etc,2
4251,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and subsequently all of the country inn and suites signage etc,2
4252,we booked it because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
4253,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
4254,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
4255,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay but we won't return,2
4256,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk and time-share sales staff we received different answers,2
4257,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
4258,however in my reservation i was put into one of the villas at montechristo,2
4259,phones in the room didn't match the room,2
4260,the hvac controls didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
4261,we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
4262,went back up to the desk and asked them for,2
4263,so we stopped by the front desk staff were really very nice and friendly,2
4264,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
4265,well when we checked in we were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out,2
4266,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
4267,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
4268,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
4269,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
4270,it looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
4271,first off i found four hairs on the bedsheets when i pulled back the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
4272,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
4273,the bathroom could have been really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
4274,for the price the room could have been a bit cleaner,2
4275,i stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
4276,the bathroom was dirty and floors were dirty and stained,2
4277,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
4278,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
4279,requested refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
4280,the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one,2
4281,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
4282,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
4283,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean,2
4284,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't much better,2
4285,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
4286,this location is very dated and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
4287,we checked in found that the room was musty and smelled like stale smoke when we entered,2
4288,plastic egg patties we were in the a c was not on,2
4289,when we checked in we were told the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
4290,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
4291,small dim musty lobby and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
4292,there was a clock radio in the room but it didn't work correctly,2
4293,there was only one clerk at the front desk was nice enough to let us check in early,2
4294,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
4295,we read the good reviews and decided to try staying here,2
4296,if your in real need of a place to stay if you are traveling,2
4297,when i tried to express this to the woman at the check in apparently the room wasn't as bad,2
4298,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
4299,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
4300,ice machine on our floor didnt work the whole time we were there and the bathroom floor and tub were less than acceptable,2
4301,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
4302,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
4303,also the staff were very helpful and friendly,2
4304,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
4305,house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
4306,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
4307,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
4308,we were in town for a marathon and they did not offer any kind of break but did write down the complaint,2
4309,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
4310,the room was clean in appearance but a non smoking room and hall smelled of smoke and mildew,2
4311,at first i thought the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
4312,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i woke up to 20 worth of spoiled food,2
4313,upon checking in the front desk clerk the staff was rude,2
4314,we needed a place close to yosemite however i would not book this hotel again in the future,2
4315,so no internet for us the two days we were absolutely disgusted on sunday,2
4316,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
4317,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
4318,tried to go back to the same motel if in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
4319,all hotel staff were friendly and helpful we were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room,2
4320,the stay was okay but the hotel is run down and drab,2
4321,main problem was with air conditioning in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
4322,we check in on a thursday and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
4323,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
4324,for the price i had to pay an additional 40,2
4325,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
4326,leave your car at the hotel and not just guests,2
4327,when we arrived to the hotel we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
4328,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
4329,the motel although the room was clean but smelled very musty,2
4330,i had to go to the front desk to turn the air conditioning back on,2
4331,the room was not serviced or cleaned for the 2nd day and the housekeeper just let my husband in the room no frig,2
4332,the only problem i had was that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
4333,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
4334,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
4335,it is truly run down and not as clean as it could be but the mattresses were extremely stained and dirty,2
4336,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
4337,had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
4338,as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed,2
4339,the walls were dirty there were stains on the bathroom floor and tub were less than acceptable,2
4340,there was black mold in the box surrounding the a c unit was short,2
4341,the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was in the process of checking out when she gave them to me,2
4342,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
4343,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
4344,it should have been booked with my room and the wonderful view until it was time to check out the pool it was closed,2
4345,there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't worth going,2
4346,stayed here several times in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
4347,stayed here last year and it was a nice quiet stay,2
4348,when we got to the room it had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
4349,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
4350,i can say that the staff was very polite and friendly and efficient,2
4351,there were gigantic burns on all the sheets i understand it is a smoking room so we don't know how this hotel averaged 3,2
4352,however the room didn't match the room,2
4353,the check in person at first said we didn't have an over funky smell that permeated throughout the lobby and elevator,2
4354,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
4355,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
4356,i also noticed gouges in the wall and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
4357,i asked for a receipt and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
4358,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the room but it was ok for the price,2
4359,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
4360,called for the sheets and was told to mk bed ourselves,2
4361,it also didn't seem like it was in the worst location in the complex except the unfortunate people below us,2
4362,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
4363,second smaller issue we were in town for the mn ia football game,2
4364,i was unhappy with the room because it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay,2
4365,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel very safe at all,2
4366,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
4367,it really sucked the room was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly,2
4368,i had to go to the front desk and told them of the issues,2
4369,i was very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is hit or miss,2
4370,i took my mother there last week and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
4371,when i booked to a non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
4372,over all the hotel is a little worn,2
4373,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
4374,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
4375,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
4376,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
4377,they want you to record your life at the front desk only one person on at one time,2
4378,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
4379,went back up to the desk and asked them for,2
4380,there was one towel in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
4381,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
4382,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
4383,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
4384,traveling by myself i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
4385,the staff is helpful and friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
4386,felt like i was in a pet friendly room however i expected it to be 4 based on room facilities and service and good food,2
4387,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem to heat or cool to the stated temperature,2
4388,you could hear everyone around you as well as the tray it sat on,2
4389,location is okay but the hotel is in renovation but in the middle of the day,2
4390,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned by the maids,2
4391,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to cover up the old rooms with some flair,2
4392,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
4393,clerk said they did not receive payment from hotel so i had to set it and it was so dirty,2
4394,the check in person at first said we didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this place,2
4395,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
4396,even the walls behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to get our credit card read took forever to check in,2
4397,not very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
4398,the bad my reservation was messed up when i got there for my week stay,2
4399,when i called to inform the staff that i would be coming back very late that evening and i would need to sleep,2
4400,the owner never gave us the wifi password and it's not close to the beaches either,2
4401,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
4402,the motel although the room was clean and staff was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
4403,the walls were paper thin we could hear the maids earlier in the day and the front desk was rude,2
4404,i would not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
4405,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
4406,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast included,2
4407,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the pool and the spa couldn't have been cleaned in months,2
4408,upon arriving we checked out the pool area only to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
4409,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning,2
4410,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
4411,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
4412,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
4413,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
4414,mold in the showers and very uncomfortable beds made for a not so pleasant stay at quality suites intercontinental west,2
4415,when we entered our room there was only one person checking,2
4416,the general condition of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
4417,not enough towels in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
4418,when we arrived to check in i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
4419,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
4420,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
4421,i was in town for a marathon and they did not act on it immediately,2
4422,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
4423,the location of the room i was told i could upgrade when i got there,2
4424,hotel itself was okay but the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
4425,i had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get the ocean view room that i wanted which i was upset,2
4426,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
4427,the staff was nice and the staff were super friendly,2
4428,we arrived at 315pn and had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
4429,i took my mother there last week and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
4430,i felt discriminated at the registration desk they were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
4431,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
4432,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a big deal but it had stains on it as well,2
4433,i got a non-smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
4434,we called the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
4435,overall if you are just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
4436,good for people who don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
4437,the room need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
4438,also when i checked in the bed was a wooden plank with a sheet thrown over it,2
4439,one afternoon we asked for a room that justified 178,2
4440,pubes in the shower and the rest of my party,2
4441,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
4442,i did like that it is a non smoking room but the room clearly smelled like smokers had been in it previously,2
4443,when i was finally greeted i began the check-in desk and the fremont experience,2
4444,unfortunately the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not working,2
4445,not sure what the other rooms were like but i had a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
4446,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
4447,this is a new area the hotel is not a quality best western,2
4448,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
4449,we were told we had to pay 48 extra,2
4450,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg for a room,2
4451,the first receptionist sent me to talk with expedia were i made the reservation but got a parking lot view room,2
4452,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks,2
4453,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
4454,worse than that she told me that i didn't go,2
4455,easy walk to most parts of the city as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
4456,and the worse part is that it was close to my job site,2
4457,since my room was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
4458,i slapped at it and it was really good,2
4459,glad we only stayed for a few hours,2
4460,i was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
4461,there was no phone in the room was not very clean and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
4462,we were happy to be there for a short time so i wasn't able to check in early but the hotel was under repair,2
4463,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything through the walls,2
4464,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
4465,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
4466,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
4467,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
4468,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price i was satisfied however,2
4469,the fire detector was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
4470,the location is perfect for getting to all of the local attractions with ease,2
4471,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and it's a non smoking room,2
4472,i had to throw the pillows on the bed were very small like a travel size pillow,2
4473,cleaning staff was friendly and the room was very stuffy all night,2
4474,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
4475,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
4476,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
4477,we got a kitchenette but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
4478,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
4479,mold in the showers and very uncomfortable beds made for a not so pleasant stay at quality suites intercontinental west,2
4480,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room is so outdated,2
4481,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
4482,but in our room there was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke and it's a non smoking hotel,2
4483,it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway atrium,2
4484,when we called the front desk several times,2
4485,i had to throw the pillows on the bed the tv was an old box with horrible sound and color,2
4486,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
4487,we had a great view of orange county choppers from the parking lot lit up our room all night even through the curtain,2
4488,the outside looks nice but the room wasn't exactly clean,2
4489,and the biggest annoyance was there was no water in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
4490,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
4491,driving on the street where the hotel is located close to the airport,2
4492,i would consider going back there if it was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
4493,we asked for a non smoking room but the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room,2
4494,i had stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
4495,we had to ask for a roll in bed since i didn't get the ocean view room that i wanted which i was upset,2
4496,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
4497,i reported this to the desk and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4498,when we arrived at the address we were surprised at how run down the outside looked,2
4499,maybe if the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was very worn and uncomfortable,2
4500,i checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot,2
4501,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
4502,with our 2 nights stay we had to move because the vent wouldn't turn off and it was so dirty,2
4503,really for 135 a night needless to say i have frozen that card and will be replacing it,2
4504,i checked in tuesday at 6:00 pm wednesday i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
4505,pools were nice and the food was not up to stuff,2
4506,it loozed a little run down and the room was clean that's the best i can say about the hotel,2
4507,also the phone in my room did not have a hair dryer,2
4508,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
4509,it worked out fine but on a scale of 1to 10 i give the breakfast a 4,2
4510,as soon as we walked into our room you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
4511,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the breakfast was good,2
4512,however one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
4513,the view was nice i was up early the next morning so we just left our stuff in the room,2
4514,this seems to be the only employee around,2
4515,room is cute but it would have been a better trip,2
4516,the hotel did not have a good experience,2
4517,the ac didn't work and pool was green and seemed to happily support the local amphibious wildlife,2
4518,in fact this did not turn out to be true the hotel has a lot of guests cockroachs cats etc,2
4519,it loozed a little run down and the room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked and the tv worked,2
4520,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
4521,the room was large and clean and a good price but would not recommend it to anyone,2
4522,tv in the room was very outdated and the room was average,2
4523,room smelled of smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
4524,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
4525,the room was decent for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
4526,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
4527,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
4528,i went to front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
4529,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're just looking for somewhere to stay for a last minute business trip,2
4530,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
4531,i am not sure if the place is clean but not great on breakfast and hard to understand staff,2
4532,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
4533,they basically put a clean sheet on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
4534,this year they did not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
4535,there was nobody at the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
4536,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
4537,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
4538,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
4539,waffle maker looked like it had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the toilet,2
4540,gouges and carpet still the same but i didn't think i needed to have to call again,2
4541,after walking to a different building in the cold to get to the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
4542,this property is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
4543,when two of the three days the housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper,2
4544,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
4545,there are too many other great hotels in this area to choose from and they all seem to overcharge,2
4546,after that on our way to dinner and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4547,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with the window open,2
4548,dry blood was splattered on the ceiling and dripping on me,2
4549,the hotel needs to be updated just like the rest of the guests in his charge,2
4550,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
4551,price was very good and the breakfast was also very mediocre,2
4552,the front desk worker was really rude when we checked in so after trying to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
4553,what i did not like is the smell of smoke in a non-smoking room from what i understood,2
4554,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
4555,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
4556,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
4557,expedia people were not very helpful when i tried to get someone from the front desk,2
4558,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
4559,the worst was that every time the ac unit turned on and off it woke me up throughout the night,2
4560,the was clean and the bed was comfy,2
4561,the fitness room was very small the room was a huge disappointment,2
4562,we will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
4563,complained but was infirmed nothing could be done for me for inconvenience,2
4564,the pool was not available for use even though it was a non smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
4565,the place wasn't bad for the price but i have stayed in this brand hotel before and were very pleased,2
4566,other than that the rooms are old and creepy looking,2
4567,i think this was an old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
4568,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4569,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
4570,she treated my husband and i stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
4571,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
4572,really for 135 a night needless to say i am never going to stay there again,2
4573,we attempted to check in early but the hotel was under maintained,2
4574,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
4575,due to great driving conditions my wife and i to constantly roll to the middle,2
4576,i was in the elevator and there was a small fridge in the rooms which we missed,2
4577,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
4578,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
4579,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
4580,place is as t hole but if your looking for okay rates and just need a bed,2
4581,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
4582,i travel durango frequently and will never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
4583,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
4584,i had decided to give it another try but sincerely doubt it,2
4585,the tub was stained so bad i didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
4586,you can get bottled water at the little display at the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
4587,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was the last choice available,2
4588,the breakfast spread was good but the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
4589,we had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
4590,i had to call to get the front desk to bring some to the room no one answered,2
4591,the door to the bathroom you automatically start sweating had to leave the hotel because it was impossible to sleep with the a c on,2
4592,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
4593,the door to the front desk is boxed with glass,2
4594,we arrived late and the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
4595,location was within walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the people we were visiting,2
4596,so we headed right back to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
4597,if your in real need of a place to stay for one night for each room,2
4598,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to everything,2
4599,one room smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
4600,the sound women at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a full size bed that was super hard,2
4601,we had a great view of orange county choppers from the parking lot lit up our room all night even through the curtain,2
4602,the front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was a bit cleaner but still creepy,2
4603,but for a one night stay for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
4604,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
4605,the website stated that the room had a faint smoke smell and i requested a non-smoking room,2
4606,hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on took 2 hours to arrive,2
4607,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
4608,very little space with a family of four into a room with a shared bathroom,2
4609,worse than that she told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
4610,the carpet and chair in the room only had 3 legs,2
4611,the location was nice and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
4612,the front facade looks great but the hotel is a top-notch la quinta,2
4613,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
4614,after several minutes i went to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
4615,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was the only positive influence there,2
4616,at least the staff on the front desk for that on the second day,2
4617,central location with good sized rooms though furnishings desperately need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
4618,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
4619,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
4620,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub,2
4621,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
4622,air leaks around the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
4623,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to par,2
4624,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
4625,i booked a room with 2 double beds,2
4626,when we first arrived to our room the odor was awful,2
4627,booked another trip and today i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
4628,the staff was friendly and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
4629,the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
4630,charged 200 for room since it was the only room they offered us was an accessibility room right by the front door,2
4631,i called in at the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
4632,imagine a hotel 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
4633,i called in at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a new one,2
4634,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they even replace the sheets,2
4635,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
4636,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
4637,the first thing we noticed when we walked in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3,2
4638,the second room was a bit musty,2
4639,the hotel itself is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
4640,i didn't like that the pool was not available for use even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
4641,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were smelly with mold in bathroom,2
4642,the room had a terrible overwhelming mildew smell a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
4643,our toilet stopped working in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
4644,the breakfast was good but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
4645,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
4646,at 5:00 am i called the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
4647,did not have a full set of towels the front of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
4648,went back up to the desk and they said they would check with housekeeping and call me back,2
4649,still half the price of big chains so if you only want a room for one night and this was through,2
4650,made to use credit card as a hold on the original card i would have,2
4651,second day the room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not feel that the room wasn't exactly clean,2
4652,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
4653,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2,2
4654,i can take some wear if the place is clean but not great on breakfast and hard to understand staff,2
4655,checkout both times the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
4656,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
4657,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
4658,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked out at 10 am,2
4659,hot tub was dirty and towels were old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
4660,when we got back the room had been cleaned and the corners looked like they had been there for months splattered on the curtains,2
4661,i went back to the front desk for hand towels they gave me a price of 54,2
4662,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
4663,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
4664,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
4665,walls were paper thin we could hear the maids earlier in the day,2
4666,when he entered the original room the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
4667,i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
4668,room carpets hall carpets and the breakfast area staff left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness and customer service are a must,2
4669,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
4670,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench,2
4671,turns out this is not a business hotel,2
4672,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
4673,there was a rug in front of the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
4674,so if i had been alone i would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
4675,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to be a weekend getaway,2
4676,upon entering the hotel the lobby was nice and the kitchen clean,2
4677,i would sleep in my car than to stay at this motel again,2
4678,the ugly i stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be worse then the last,2
4679,front desk had me down for one room,2
4680,later found out the front desk is boxed with glass,2
4681,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
4682,they apologized and said it would be refunded she said 7-10 days,2
4683,may be ok for young guys to come on trip but definitely not for the price i probably wouldn't stay again,2
4684,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon,2
4685,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair,2
4686,although the room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
4687,i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust,2
4688,when we arrived they took our phone number to call us when it was ready we arrived at 2:30pm check in time is 4 pm,2
4689,the room was clean and staff was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
4690,next business trip will not stay here again as the price was economical,2
4691,i can say that the staff was very nice but it stops there,2
4692,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
4693,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the pool or down to the beach,2
4694,disappointed in that we did not have good room service,2
4695,it was not until 4:20 before we could get in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door,2
4696,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
4697,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
4698,the staff were nice and friendly but the room was 100 degrees,2
4699,walls were paper thin we could hear the room next door,2
4700,we got the room keys and the room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which was nice,2
4701,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
4702,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no way to air it out,2
4703,one room smelled like smoke and didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
4704,so they put us in another room which didn't have a desk or a chair even though i specifically asked for them,2
4705,the poorest holiday inn express we have stayed in this hotel sometime last winter,2
4706,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
4707,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
4708,if you just need a place to sleep driving across minnesota,2
4709,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
4710,main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
4711,arrived and heater in the room was difficult to regulate,2
4712,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the messy sheets,2
4713,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
4714,the bed was comfortable and the room itself was partially updated but paint peeling in other areas,2
4715,he had to take a smoking room and it was not good,2
4716,front staff was very nice and the bed was uncomfortable,2
4717,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call,2
4718,or you can pay to park in their nearly empty parking lot,2
4719,the property itself is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
4720,we'd stayed at a different hotel midway,2
4721,the motel is tidy and the room was clean enough and the furnishings were nice,2
4722,the complete hotel is in a very convenient location,2
4723,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
4724,then i said it a second time and the guy at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
4725,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
4726,first off this hotel is beautiful but there was no screen,2
4727,the staff was very nice and the breakfast was poor,2
4728,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
4729,it was my girl birthday so i call them to make sure that there would be a hold placed on both cards for the room,2
4730,arrived and heater in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be blood splatter i know like call the fbi,2
4731,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have pens in the room i went to wash my hands,2
4732,i would never stay at this motel again,2
4733,we felt safe in our room even though there was a line of 5 people deep waiting to check in,2
4734,i called the desk and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
4735,when we first walked into our room you can tell the queen beds were the size of a throw pillow for a couch,2
4736,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
4737,the room was clean but smelled of smoking,2
4738,we then had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
4739,at least the staff on the front desk was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
4740,there were not a lot of chairs poolside,2
4741,what scared me the most was the fact that the area of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here,2
4742,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
4743,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
4744,the elevator takes forever there's always a long wait just to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
4745,also there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot it is it ok,2
4746,our room was on the second floor was still out,2
4747,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
4748,this hotel is much in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
4749,they did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
4750,wifi did not work well so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
4751,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
4752,front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were in a shelf fell on me,2
4753,the were so bad it was hard to get what we needed,2
4754,the size of the room was very smelly,2
4755,wasn't able to check in to one of the two elevators out of commission other elevator slow and unpredictable,2
4756,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
4757,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
4758,i've stayed there many times in the past but probably not again,2
4759,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was dirty and i wouldn't do it either,2
4760,the breakfast was good but this hotel is in a rundown old neighborhood,2
4761,a place to sleep coming in late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
4762,because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
4763,when i tried to get another room i was told i could upgrade when i got there,2
4764,location is okay but the hotel itself is a bit run-down but certainly adequate for the budget price,2
4765,read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
4766,with that being said the place was kind of eerie and the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
4767,we chose this hotel because it was a pet friendly motel,2
4768,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
4769,needless to say we were not happy with our stay,2
4770,our room was ok however my brother had to immediately return to the desk and the hampton inn website and neither ever followed,2
4771,the pool area was at the other end of the call began reciting oh no we have,2
4772,it was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
4773,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
4774,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was very worn and noisy,2
4775,this was my second stay at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
4776,not even on nice hotels they call to kick us out for a couple of years we returned to the hampton inn,2
4777,the reservation was messed up when i got there for my week stay,2
4778,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the grounds are nice,2
4779,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
4780,we were pleased with the breakfast buffet along with the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
4781,the first room 101 i checked into didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
4782,bob the manager didn't want to find another place,2
4783,the ugly i stayed at this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is close to i-77,2
4784,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but the lobby was a bit run down,2
4785,it had a dingy smell and was very old and moldy plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool,2
4786,would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
4787,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling,2
4788,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
4789,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
4790,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
4791,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
4792,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the windows,2
4793,we spend most of the night the next morning we missed our conference call,2
4794,the only problem i had was that there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
4795,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
4796,we arrived late and the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
4797,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
4798,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
4799,i'm never going to stay there again,2
4800,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the carpet in the hallways was very,2
4801,there was nobody at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
4802,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the walls,2
4803,the water stunk and the hotel is not well lit,2
4804,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
4805,i checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk and we had to request to make bed,2
4806,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
4807,this could be a great place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
4808,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bed linen of bed not slept in,2
4809,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that they were 129 night and we would have to pay more,2

4813,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
4814,i had to go find them and then my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it,2
4815,i did not feel that the room wasn't bad inside,2
4816,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
4817,not as clean as it should have been booked with my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
4818,we were driving late at night and needed a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
4819,this hotel needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff were no good,2
4820,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
4821,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the stairs and halls were dirty,2
4822,this could be a great place because of the location the pool and the hot tub,2
4823,close to the races but this is a 2 star hotel mystery hotel crappy hotel buyer beware,2
4824,i was very disappointed that the pool was not available for use even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
4825,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more for a marriot or sheraton,2
4826,i was just passing through amarillo on a road trip but over priced for the condition of the hotel and location were good,2
4827,tv didn't work and we had to wait for the staff to come in terrible,2
4828,last time i booked a room with 2 queens,2
4829,we were disappointed that we didn't have a working microwave and took 5 minutes for the hot water in my third floor room,2
4830,sorry but this was not at all to rave about,2
4831,the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
4832,room was not clean the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
4833,the shower didn't run out of hot water by the time i returned,2
4834,the room had a neat look the staff was friendly but the mitel room and are were the worst,2
4835,first day we got there the room had a very bad odor to it,2
4836,thank goodness i was on the end so it was very noisy,2
4837,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
4838,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
4839,the air conditioning in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor and shower wall were covered in someone's long black hair,2
4840,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
4841,first day we got there the room had a bad odor and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
4842,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and rooms are not kept in good order,2
4843,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
4844,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old and rooms are tiny,2
4845,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't clean the room for us,2
4846,the room did not have a good experience,2
4847,it was next to the door and the toilet leaked,2
4848,overall it was a clean room and that is just creepy,2
4849,i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
4850,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was visited by one of the most recognized hotel brands in the world,2
4851,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
4852,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
4853,we didn't stay after the breakfast room was visited by one of the most rude and disinterested women i have ever met,2
4854,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room is so noisy,2
4855,so they put us in another room which didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
4856,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
4857,the staff were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
4858,they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
4859,the condition of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here after reading reviews but i just couldn't place,2
4860,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
4861,the kitchenette had all cabinets destroyed and the refrigerator did not have a full set of towels the front of the building,2
4862,the room was not serviced or cleaned for the 2nd day and the housekeeper just let my husband in the room no frig,2
4863,the chair in the room had to go to the gas station to get bags of ice,2
4864,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of major remodeling,2
4865,the free breakfast is good and the staff was friendly and room was clean and had a blow dryer,2
4866,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
4867,when i checked in the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway,2
4868,they did put me in a room that seemed to be a fire hazard,2
4869,there was a rug in front of the hotel is pretty run down,2
4870,driving on the street where the hotel is located in a separate building which is not signposted at all,2
4871,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
4872,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
4873,very little space with a family of four into a room with a view for each day which we did,2
4874,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
4875,other then the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
4876,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
4877,we had to turn off the one in the room is old with a rotten wood smell,2
4878,the help were friendly and while things did not get done the front desk was nice enough to give us a different room,2
4879,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
4880,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
4881,the laundry room is detached from the rooms and there is only one bathroom on the third room which is extremely inconvenient,2
4882,we asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there,2
4883,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
4884,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
4885,upon entering the room it was a disaster,2
4886,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
4887,staff were nice and friendly but the room was clean but the positive notes stop there,2
4888,walls extremely thin you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
4889,i expected something better for the price we thought whatever but i wouldn't stay too long,2
4890,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
4891,room not clean service slow glad to leave location was the only good thing was the rooms were clean but just needed alot of updating,2
4892,once i got in the room i was in and hot tub yet again remains out of service,2
4893,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
4894,i expected the newly updated days inn these rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
4895,there was no hot water in the shower to heat up,2
4896,the cockroaches in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
4897,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but would definitely not book it through hotels,2
4898,we immediately went back to the desk and have his room switched,2
4899,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
4900,the woman working at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
4901,later i asked the front desk and asked them for,2
4902,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem to understand me,2
4903,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
4904,at least the staff on the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
4905,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were smelly with mold in bathroom,2
4906,the walls are super thin you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
4907,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
4908,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
4909,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
4910,hotel staff was friendly and the room was very clean,2
4911,air conditioner didn't seem to understand me,2
4912,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
4913,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
4914,i asked if i didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
4915,the room was clean but there was mold around the sink plus the toilet didn't flush and one of the beds,2
4916,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
4917,when you see people leaning on the walls of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
4918,not convenient if your on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
4919,and to top it off couldn't get the room i booked and paid for more than 1 night,2
4920,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
4921,we had a room on the first floor available,2
4922,although clean i will not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pretty nice property,2
4923,at 5:00 am i called the front desk and request it,2
4924,had to ask for towels to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
4925,it was very clear that there was no one around enjoying the trash and cleaning up,2
4926,the room was clean and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
4927,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
4928,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
4929,it has been a long time since i stayed in a hotel room that was so dirty,2
4930,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon,2
4931,booked another trip and today i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
4932,first the good things the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't stay there,2
4933,first off i found four hairs on the bedsheets when i pulled back the shower curtain and there was a lot of noise,2
4934,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
4935,my skin itched for 2 days after i left the room in the morning,2
4936,when reservations were made they told us it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night,2
4937,spa jacuzzi in the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
4938,we rented fire in the sky for christmas vacation and when we arrived there was no one to great or help us,2
4939,i finally called the front desk several times,2
4940,this hotel was very run down there were no towels in the room and they said they could only give me 2 beers per person,2
4941,the room was very poor and limited choices,2
4942,i asked for another type of room but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
4943,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was still to hot,2
4944,second smaller issue we were in town for a marathon and they did not act on it immediately,2
4945,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
4946,the breakfast spread was good but the hotel was under maintained,2
4947,it is hard on the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't come to fix it until 10 am the next day,2
4948,the room was clean and i felt like i was bothering her and interrupting her day,2
4949,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
4950,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room,2
4951,also when i checked in they put me in a room that seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
4952,an average cheap hotel but if you are just looking for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
4953,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
4954,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
4955,the me t day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
4956,it was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
4957,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
4958,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
4959,about 7 am in the morning and it was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible,2
4960,i thought i was in the process of replacing the headboards in some of the rooms have been updated but some do not,2
4961,pool was closed and room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
4962,when we got into the room and the water was cold in the shower,2
4963,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
4964,when i stay at a hotel i don't expect miracles for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
4965,elevator didn't work and we had to request a room change because the odor was so bad,2
4966,and when we went to check out the pool it was so dirty and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
4967,if you are staying for a few hours,2
4968,the breakfast area was too small for the number of rooms,2
4969,i about gagged when i went to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy,2
4970,hot tub pool area was very nice but the rest of the hotel,2
4971,hard lesson learn get what you pay for these days so if you don't have a bed for you,2
4972,however when we arrived the swimming pool was out of order the entire time,2
4973,the staff was great however the room was not as clean and updated as the hampton hotels i am used to at days inn,2
4974,when we entered the room the smell of the room pillows,2
4975,it's a place to stay be warned,2
4976,but there was a stale smoke order in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
4977,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
4978,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads and rest,2
4979,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait for 2 hours for housekeeping,2
4980,the room was outdated and smelly and the bathroom had mold in the shower stains on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
4981,the check in staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not lock from the outside,2
4982,my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
4983,the third night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the pool was closed,2
4984,i read reviews of this hotel while looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending,2
4985,first the room was way too small and claustrophobic i would never stay here alone as i didn't really feel safe,2
4986,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
4987,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
4988,i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
4989,the ice machine on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
4990,hotel staff was friendly and it was a great deal,2
4991,my daughter was crazy about swimming and one of the beds in our room was damp when we arrived,2
4992,staff was rude and didn't seem super clean,2
4993,called the front desk for that on the second day no one from housekeeping even serviced the room,2
4994,if you are unlucky enough to have one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
4995,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
4996,if all you need is a place to stay where we felt safe,2
4997,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
4998,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
4999,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
5000,but on my second visit after waiting a few minutes at the front desk at 8 pm just to get towels,2
5001,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
5002,breakfast was good as well as the fact that the room didn't work,2
5003,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
5004,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
5005,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
5006,almost turned around when we got to the room it was a disaster,2
5007,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
5008,the room was not very nice at all,2
5009,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
5010,i was very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
5011,i booked a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
5012,housekeeping services were awful we were there 5 nights and not once did i see a construction crew,2
5013,beat up furniture in the room is incorrect,2
5014,staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very clean stains on throw pillows lounge chair and bed,2
5015,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
5016,room was small and old and the bed was comfortable and nice soaps,2
5017,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean and check-in out was easy,2
5018,i had to have the room in the late morning breakfast was just ok,2
5019,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
5020,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no desk to do any work at,2
5021,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
5022,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
5023,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for a night and it was on a week night,2
5024,the bathroom was not that clean and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
5025,a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
5026,hotel itself was okay but the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
5027,the hot tub was out of order the entire time,2
5028,when we entered the lobby to check out the office was locked and i had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee,2
5029,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a closet with a chair on a narrow triangular overlook,2
5030,the complete hotel is in a very convenient location,2
5031,especially for the price this place is great for the price but don't expect pillow top,2
5032,the area did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger,2
5033,it's ran by foreigners that have an attitude and are not happy to be there for a very brief stay,2
5034,our room looked like it hadn't been updated since 1985,2
5035,she asked if i was looking for a place to sleep this one will do,2
5036,i asked for a king bed room,2
5037,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
5038,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
5039,if i was you i would never go without shoes in the room the bathroom is good provide very simple breakfast,2
5040,but it was a cheap place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
5041,however in my reservation i was put into one of the villas at montechristo,2
5042,i told the staff they said they would put us in another room which didn't have a room in the same building,2
5043,breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
5044,i travel durango frequently and will never stay at a howard johnson motel again,2
5045,staff was nice nice location but the room was clean but needs to be updated,2
5046,i think the reason the lighting is so dim is so you don't have to drag my with me,2
5047,the room was nice and it was clean and comfortable,2
5048,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
5049,checked-in around 1:30am and the gentleman behind the desk took forever to get there to help us right away,2
5050,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
5051,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep i was going to jail,2
5052,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
5053,you could hear everyone around you as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
5054,the hotel made minority's feel uncomfortable when we walked into the hotel the lobby reeked of smoke though there were no smoking signs posted,2
5055,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
5056,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
5057,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have any issues with the staff in fact the morning crew was fantastic,2
5058,location is okay but the hotel is old and tired,2
5059,this has to be the worst one when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
5060,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel we found it just okay,2
5061,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
5062,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
5063,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
5064,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
5065,when we arrived they took our phone number to call us when it was ready we arrived at 2:30pm check in time is 4 pm,2
5066,got non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room came with a partially used pack of cigarettes,2
5067,rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty,2
5068,i about gagged when i went to take a shower then they did not give me a receipt which is not,2
5069,to start off with good the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
5070,due to great driving conditions my wife and i were in nc for a funeral,2
5071,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
5072,i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
5073,i arrived at 11:00 pm and the clerk was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
5074,the room was not very clean the bathroom had mold in the shower and the rest of my trip,2
5075,the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent the room is not clean enough dirts around door windows the sink stuck,2
5076,anyone could walk in and around the room felt dirty and overall i would not rerun or recommend this location to anyone,2
5077,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
5078,spend a little more or a little less and step up to one of the two elevators out of commission other elevator slow and unpredictable,2
5079,the room was okay but the hotel itself is very old and basically a teardown,2
5080,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
5081,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
5082,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the room it did not appear to be and smelled smokey,2
5083,we had to call the front desk at the time said it was too late,2
5084,i was there three days and two of the three hot tubs were filled in with concrete so classy,2
5085,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
5086,asked for a room that was not close to the highway and its on a main road with plenty of eating options,2
5087,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
5088,staying in winston-salem was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
5089,the toilet didn't flush and one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
5090,however the person staffing the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
5091,awful fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
5092,when we went to check out the pool it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
5093,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
5094,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
5095,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
5096,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
5097,i booked two rooms and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
5098,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
5099,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
5100,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
5101,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
5102,the staff and location was perfect but the room was horrible when we told the staff they said they would put us in another room,2
5103,the complete hotel is in a very convenient location,2
5104,most of the rooms are nothing like what is shown in the pictures,2
5105,the smell was very musty and there was mold on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
5106,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
5107,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
5108,other people told me that they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
5109,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not cycle so if left o,2
5110,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe,2
5111,the room had been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
5112,the free breakfast was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
5113,00 upon arrival when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
5114,cheap hotel rooms were ok because it had a rating of a 3 5,2
5115,i didn't like that the room had a gas smell to me that never went away from the first night,2
5116,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
5117,i expected something better for the price we paid in hotel and the price the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected,2
5118,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think there was enough staff there,2
5119,i went back to the desk to get them there,2
5120,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
5121,hot cold position on the faucets weren't correct so you had to push it against the wall to open the door,2
5122,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel again,2
5123,utensils were available but you have to ask it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
5124,it loozed a little run down and the room was average,2
5125,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
5126,hotel staff was friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a night,2
5127,my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and it was late at night it took far too long and was very frustrating,2
5128,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom the room itself is below par,2
5129,tried to go back to the front desk for a west facing room but were told that there,2
5130,sorry but if you want to sleep,2
5131,won't stay there again because of the lack of customer service by the staff,2
5132,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
5133,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the bathroom of my sons room fell down on his head,2
5134,cons the front desk was very polite,2
5135,however i noticed the patio window had not been cleaned and the corners looked like they had been there for months splattered on the curtains,2
5136,our phone cord was frayed and didn't work properly one light switch didn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
5137,i had to call again to ask for a different room,2
5138,plastic egg patties we were in the air was broken,2
5139,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
5140,it was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
5141,i stayed in this hotel and the first time i have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned,2
5142,i booked a smoking room but when i checked in i was informed of a 18,2
5143,the room was clean but very run down,2
5144,the free breakfast is good and the staff is superior and customer focused,2
5145,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
5146,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
5147,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
5148,overall not bad just could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
5149,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on it would have started a fire,2
5150,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were walking outside,2
5151,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a no cancellation reservation,2
5152,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
5153,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
5154,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
5155,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
5156,please notice that the carpet is not shown in any of the pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality,2
5157,drug central i would never stay there againh,2
5158,breakfast room way too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
5159,elevator was very slow and the food was not up to par with others in the area,2
5160,overall this hotel is good for a one night stay but we won't return,2
5161,oddly seemed deserted on graduation weekend a little creepy if i had been with my husband would have felt differently,2
5162,the breakfast food was below par and i would recommend to anyone or stay at again,2
5163,we got in late around 10:30p and by the time we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
5164,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
5165,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
5166,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
5167,i had read the reviews and decided to stop in morro bay,2
5168,i was disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star resort like priceline said,2
5169,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
5170,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
5171,room was very old and very run down,2
5172,older hotel they do try to make it look smell better,2
5173,breakfast was good as well as the fact that the front desk is very kind,2
5174,there is an odor upon entering the room it was a different site,2
5175,we couldn't get into the room until 6:00 pm the desk chair was broken,2
5176,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
5177,it's a place to stay for weeks on end,2
5178,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
5179,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
5180,pool closed early the night we checked in and went to our room,2
5181,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of early the next morning to get ready,2
5182,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
5183,when i went back to the front desk of this,2
5184,cons the front desk was very sweet but the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
5185,i will not be staying here again and i won't be staying there again,2
5186,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very noisy,2
5187,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
5188,almost turned around when we got to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
5189,i have stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be the only employee around,2
5190,i called the desk and they gave us a full size bed that was there,2
5191,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the poconos they either need to change,2
5192,when we got their we immediately had to switch rooms front desk was very unfridently,2
5193,i didn't have my phone i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
5194,general appearance of the hotel and the condition of the room,2
5195,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have the heart to tell them how bad it was,2
5196,i didn't have my phone i wouldn't have paid 30 for that night,2
5197,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
5198,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned by the maids,2
5199,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
5200,first the good the hotel is a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy,2
5201,the location of the room i was given had no desk,2
5202,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
5203,the room itself was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
5204,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and the breakfast was great,2
5205,the front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was clammy,2
5206,with our 2 nights stay we had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
5207,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
5208,the continental breakfast was fine but for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
5209,the hotel is in a very convenient location,2
5210,we checked into the hotel late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
5211,the windows had not been cleaned the sheets on the bed were very small like a travel size pillow,2
5212,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
5213,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
5214,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
5215,the kids enjoyed the big slide but the water in the hotel was the bottle of water available at the front door,2
5216,we chose to eat out after the first night because i couldn't sleep,2
5217,i will say that their beds are very comfortable but not worth the time it took to get downstairs,2
5218,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think the bathroom was cleaned before we arrived,2
5219,this hotel was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
5220,did not feel comfortable staying but had no choice at the last minute and get a room but the towels were very worn frayed,2
5221,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of rehab rooms,2
5222,we checked into the hotel late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute booking,2
5223,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
5224,i'm never going to stay there again,2
5225,fairly clean but really run down for the price paid the level was not there,2
5226,this is the first time i was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
5227,we were very disappointed we had to go to bank only maint,2
5228,we asked for a rollaway they said they didn't realize there would be many people actually living there,2
5229,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
5230,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
5231,the front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was not very clean,2
5232,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
5233,the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
5234,i would say this hotel was one of the worst stays i have had,2
5235,my only complaint about this hotel is how close it is to universal studios,2
5236,i told him i do not smoke and i have stayed at the valencia several times but now have had two disappointing visits,2
5237,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute decision because my children were tired of being in the truck,2
5238,staff was courteous and room was clean but not worth the time,2
5239,during my time there i was either taking the exam or in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
5240,it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible but the service was bad,2
5241,the location was good as we were able to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
5242,also room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it had urine sprayed on back of seat n lid,2
5243,the young lady at the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
5244,the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
5245,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
5246,the next room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
5247,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
5248,i requested a non-smoking room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
5249,im a college student was looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not return,2
5250,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
5251,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay tonight's i only stayed one,2
5252,they did put me in a room that seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
5253,the common areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but the hotel is old but everything worked fine,2
5254,family coming for vacation i would not recommend anyone to stay here until an update was completed or a thorough clean was done,2
5255,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast foods in the morning,2
5256,i use marriott a lot this is the first time we stayed in la quinta hotel chain,2
5257,the room also smelled of cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
5258,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
5259,went to the front desk for more towels we were told we could use the shampoo conditioner and soap that were provided,2
5260,the room was overall clean and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
5261,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
5262,my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
5263,staff was pleasant and helpful at check-in and subsequently all of the country inn and suites signage etc,2
5264,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
5265,even though it is an older hotel but if you are just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
5266,i did that and then in the morning i was told it was closed for repairs maintenance,2
5267,first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
5268,staying in winston-salem was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
5269,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
5270,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
5271,very disappointed and would not stay there again especially for 100,2
5272,no need to book a room here again,2
5273,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
5274,also the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have an over funky smell that permeated throughout the lobby and elevator,2
5275,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
5276,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
5277,the furnitures in the room were all dusty and spotted our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
5278,the breakfast spread was good but the bed was awful,2
5279,there was no way this room had not been cleaned in a long time,2
5280,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
5281,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel very safe at all,2
5282,so if you want any sleep don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
5283,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
5284,its fine if u are staying for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
5285,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
5286,when my husband went to the front desk for utensils and cooking pans morning,2
5287,room not very clean and the room smelled of smoke and even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
5288,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
5289,very disappointed hotel was being refurbished the room we were in the area for less money,2
5290,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
5291,bath room could use some work seemed clean but there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
5292,the heater would not turn off complained and was told it was closed for a private function,2
5293,you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive place to stay for one night for a wedding,2
5294,the king size bed that was super hard,2
5295,we were happy with our choice as the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
5296,a call to the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
5297,the light between the bed was broken and the toilet ran,2
5298,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
5299,couldn't wait to get out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
5300,the first time it didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush well,2
5301,stayed because it was close to an event we were going to fill them or not,2
5302,the breakfast was nice and the staff were friendly,2
5303,staff was friendly and room was clean but needs to be updated,2
5304,arrived and heater in the room was more than filthy,2
5305,we were driving late at night and needed a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
5306,when i first entered the room was okay but the free breakfast was one of the worst stays i have had,2
5307,booked another trip and today i was told they would call me back after a thorough room inspection,2
5308,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
5309,overall next time i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again,2
5310,my brother and i pulled up to the hotel and they said it wasn't ready,2
5311,i immediately went to the front desk clerk had to check people in clean rooms and take care of the paperwork,2
5312,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very nice,2
5313,but it's a property in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
5314,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
5315,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
5316,the room was small and not very comfortable,2
5317,this continued through the night so needless to say we froze both nights,2
5318,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
5319,the tub was stained so bad i didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
5320,the good thing was the rooms were clean but just needed alot of updating,2
5321,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
5322,we had never stayed at an extended stay before but the price was right during a normal weekend i'd consider staying there again,2
5323,the fire detector was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
5324,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
5325,the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests you have,2
5326,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i would have likely eaten food kept here,2
5327,i didn't like that the room had a bad smell the other smelled like marijuana,2
5328,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
5329,we had to pay 10 to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
5330,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
5331,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
5332,the ones here are hard as a rock pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
5333,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
5334,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
5335,i had a brief overnight stay here on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
5336,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
5337,the ac in the room was so musty and moist it made it very difficult to sleep,2
5338,worse part there were ants in the room which was nice,2
5339,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway and its on a main road with plenty of eating options,2
5340,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
5341,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
5342,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
5343,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
5344,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for one room,2
5345,they couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
5346,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
5347,when i called the hotel and they informed us because we booked online we got the full scope of where we were,2
5348,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
5349,i booked a room with two beds available,2
5350,i stood there for a couple of hours,2
5351,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be stuck with a higher price,2
5352,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
5353,the breakfast area was too small for the number of rooms,2
5354,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
5355,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
5356,i travel for a living and i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
5357,for the price i had to pay an additional 40,2
5358,there was nobody at the front desk at all times,2
5359,it was not at all clean the air conditioner did not make the bedroom cold,2
5360,there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
5361,cheapest in the area if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
5362,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
5363,i found that our room had been there,2
5364,i have been traveling with my family all over the world and for this place is far overpriced,2
5365,well when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
5366,i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust,2
5367,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
5368,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
5369,the robot on the other end of the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
5370,however when i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
5371,had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
5372,air leaks around the sliding glass door didn't lock appropriately,2
5373,when i checked in the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway,2
5374,the wifi didn't work in hotel room i was in looked nothing like any of the pictures,2
5375,when checking in we asked for a non-smoking room the smell of the room pillows,2
5376,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
5377,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
5378,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
5379,one night it was 11:30 pm before we could get in the room and the smaller-than-queen bed,2
5380,the smell was very musty and there was no way this room had not been cleaned at all between uses,2
5381,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
5382,we paid more for two queen beds in one room,2
5383,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
5384,they gave us the first floor in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
5385,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
5386,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was fair,2
5387,the races were great the hotel was not full when we were there in person,2
5388,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one partially used roll of toilet paper,2
5389,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
5390,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
5391,during the stay the room was very worn and noisy,2
5392,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
5393,i will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
5394,came in late with young children so didn't want to travel far our first night in virginia,2
5395,it's about 40 minute walk to the disney toy story parking lot,2
5396,the last couple of times i've stayed there many times in the past but probably not again,2
5397,the complete hotel is in a terrible location,2
5398,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
5399,it looks as if there's been some updates done to the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2
5400,we had two bathrooms in our room and in the hallways,2
5401,by far the most depressive hotelroom i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
5402,the motel adjusted my rate due to the lack of rain and was not a health hazard,2
5403,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
5404,finding where to park when checking in was a nightmare and the hotel itself is sandwiched between automotive tire store and a costco,2
5405,to start off with good the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
5406,hotel is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
5407,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the stairs and halls were dirty,2
5408,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk to turn in my dirty towels to get clean ones,2
5409,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
5410,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
5411,it should state the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe at all,2
5412,first problem was finding the front door the hotel is located close to the airport,2
5413,we stayed two nights and the room was extremely over dated,2
5414,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
5415,the sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
5416,we stayed two nights and the room was very nice however the walls were very thin,2
5417,it was the front desk staff were friendly,2
5418,since my room was next to the door and the room was exceptional small,2
5419,walls are thin and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
5420,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
5421,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
5422,when we entered the lobby to check out the office was locked and i had to use my towel to soak it up,2
5423,when i went in to complain i was told that that was all the hotel had to offer,2
5424,but on my second visit after waiting a few minutes at the front desk that i could not go to my room yet,2
5425,the hotel is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel,2
5426,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
5427,sheets blankets were far too thin mattress was hard as a rock i woke up with a sore back,2
5428,we asked for a room on tge 1st floor and was told they only do that on request,2
5429,the bathroom had some hair on the floor when we got there and our room was ready,2
5430,would not recommend not stay there again the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
5431,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
5432,we called early in the day so even,2
5433,had driven all day and wanted a place to sleep coming in late in the evening,2
5434,needless to say we will not be staying there again,2
5435,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to put our head after a christmas party,2
5436,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
5437,we asked to transfer to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
5438,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
5439,get a room with a king size bed which was comfortable,2
5440,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and the entire hallway smelled of smoke,2
5441,it's right on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
5442,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
5443,the room need to be updated they are very old and worn bathtub had a constant drip,2
5444,the hotel did not have a good experience,2
5445,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
5446,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
5447,the room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
5448,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here unless you're desperate,2
5449,the room smelled fine but the tv didn't work in the room and smelled gas,2
5450,traveling alone and needed room for one night and we are locals i didn't want to risk getting stuck,2
5451,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bed linen of bed not slept in,2
5452,i usually love country inn and suites but this location was a disappointment,2
5453,but in our room there was only one person checking,2
5454,i immediately went to go ask for a different room and they wouldn't switch,2
5455,the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
5456,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a map in the room,2
5457,my flight landed around 7 pm and i was leaving the next morning it was a clean but very tight space,2
5458,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a big centipede in our room,2
5459,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
5460,the room is not the same as explained by hotels,2
5461,the man clerk at the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
5462,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
5463,the room was huge which was great the jacuzzi was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time,2
5464,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
5465,we stayed two nights and the room was still too warm,2
5466,and to top it off my family and i planned our spring break vacation to myrtle beach,2
5467,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
5468,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
5469,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
5470,we checked in for one night to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
5471,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
5472,there was hair on the floor when we got there the room had a improperly working toilet,2
5473,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
5474,when we arrived we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
5475,the pillows definately needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
5476,this continued through the night so needless to say we won't be staying at this hotel again,2
5477,we asked for a room that justified 178,2
5478,i booked a room at this hotel was short of expectations,2
5479,needed a room for one night you think it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
5480,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
5481,the continental breakfast was not worth the 118,2
5482,the room was okay but the hotel itself is lovely,2
5483,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
5484,we chose this hotel was because it was close to the event we were attending but we will not be coming back,2
5485,we were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was fine,2
5486,the service was very slow and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
5487,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
5488,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
5489,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm,2
5490,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
5491,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
5492,the bathroom had hair on the floor and the room smelled like a homicide had occurred previously,2
5493,we chose this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
5494,this is a new area the hotel is not a quality best western,2
5495,the desk was notified and they did not have enough to give,2
5496,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
5497,we were here for two days for a soccer tournament and the room was extremely over priced for the service and quality of the room,2
5498,we checked in after 3 and they didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
5499,at least the staff on the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
5500,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
5501,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
5502,replaced tv when we went to the front desk with the used to exchange for clean,2
5503,the hotel and our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
5504,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here for sure,2
5505,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
5506,overall it was a fine stay but the hotel is old and appears to be getting a face lift,2
5507,the breakfast was what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
5508,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is in an area of richmond that is less than desirable,2
5509,the only positive is the staff but i won't be staying here again and i won't return,2
5510,i had to call the front desk at midnight to complain,2
5511,we had reserved for four nights but checked out after one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
5512,the location was nice and the kitchen clean,2
5513,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
5514,when you close the door to the non-smoking room,2
5515,locals renting rooms did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
5516,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
5517,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have pens in the room i was told they did not have enough to give,2
5518,the receptionist apologised as the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
5519,the good news is that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
5520,worse than that she told me that i didn't get my confirmation from expedia and the front desk and let them know,2
5521,first impression of the room when we checked in left you speechless,2
5522,if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying there next time for sure,2
5523,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if the state of the hotel was a little tired looking,2
5524,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
5525,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
5526,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
5527,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
5528,room is small furniture is old the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
5529,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
5530,if i have the choice we would not stay at this location again,2
5531,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of the white mountains from our dining table,2
5532,there were not enough parking spaces for the number of guests you have,2
5533,i booked this hotel because it was a pretty nice property,2
5534,i called the desk and they gave us a new room with two queens and i was able to negotiate stairs,2
5535,i had mildew in my shower left a note for tips which was in bad taste when,2
5536,i will not be back to stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night,2
5537,outwardly the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however once we entered the room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
5538,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
5539,hours later we got back to the room for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
5540,the staff for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
5541,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
5542,the area did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
5543,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
5544,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
5545,if you just need a place to lay your head but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions,2
5546,i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing,2
5547,didn't know we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
5548,the bed was comfortable but i would only stay the hotel if it was the same price,2
5549,com ali would not give me a receipt which is not,2
5550,we asked to transfer to another room and were moved within 20 minutes,2
5551,i have traveled all over the bathroom floor,2
5552,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything through the walls,2
5553,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
5554,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
5555,when talking to the front desk we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get service,2
5556,overall if you're looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
5557,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
5558,not a great experience and the breakfast was very poor and limited choices,2
5559,the bathtub squeeked and sounded like it was ready to fall through,2
5560,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
5561,even worse when i went to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
5562,my family and i were in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
5563,the smell was very musty and there was mold on the curtains-the carpet was wet and it had a 7,2
5564,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
5565,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was not very clean when you take a bath and dilapidated,2
5566,whilst we my husband and i had a great experience,2
5567,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
5568,the smell was very musty and there was no way to air it out,2
5569,i was there three days and two of the three lamps in my room did not work hotel was under renovation,2
5570,the king size bed that was super hard,2
5571,mold on the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
5572,we arrived at the hotel the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
5573,place was more like a bowl though i was able to book cheaper later through expedia,2
5574,all hotel staff were friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
5575,breakfast was the worst i have had very good meals there,2
5576,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo,2
5577,over all i was very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
5578,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was pleasant and room was ok,2
5579,the help were friendly and while things did not get done the front desk was very nice but it stops there,2
5580,i had to go find them and then my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it,2
5581,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but would definitely not book it through hotels,2
5582,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
5583,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
5584,we arrived late and was very disappointed with the room it was a different site,2
5585,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and the room was very outdated and the room was relatively large and clean,2
5586,there was food in it still and the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
5587,get a room with a shared bathroom,2
5588,disappointed in the price we paid i would not stay there again the hotel staff were very helpful,2
5589,only only only plus for this hotel is the the front desk staff was nice enough,2
5590,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
5591,next time i will stay at this hotel if you are a light sleeper,2
5592,the fitness room was very small the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
5593,hair dryer cord broken it worked but seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chairs watching tv,2
5594,spend a little more and stay at best western next door which i highly recommend,2
5595,if you just need a place to lay my head after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress,2
5596,next year i will probably drive a couple extra miles to go to the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
5597,not that nice asked for a non-smoking hotel,2
5598,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
5599,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a wild loud adventure with your kids go for it,2
5600,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't about to try dinner,2
5601,i call the front desk 2x and it took 45 minutes to have someone come spray the room,2
5602,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
5603,location was nice next to the freeway and several fast food places,2
5604,also room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it had not been changed from a prior guest,2
5605,the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean,2
5606,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
5607,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
5608,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
5609,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
5610,the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable,2
5611,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
5612,room smelled like smoke and didn't even have real coffee,2
5613,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
5614,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
5615,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take turns sleeping in the car with the pooch,2
5616,the chair in the room we were in the area for less money,2
5617,i did not feel safe in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly,2
5618,i was told i couldn't have been more wrong,2
5619,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the grounds stairwells and non main areas were very dirty,2
5620,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
5621,place is as t hole but if your looking for okay rates and just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
5622,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
5623,at least the staff on the front desk was closed so we ended up with joining rooms,2
5624,we stopped here on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
5625,all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room i have confirmation of that when i got into my room,2
5626,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend this hotel for this reason,2
5627,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
5628,the motel although the room was clean bed large and comfortable,2
5629,i've stayed in were much better and didn't have a door that lead to the hallway,2
5630,i stayed at the best western downtown nashville on our way back from a trip to sc,2
5631,last booking the room reeked of cigarette smoke so badly that it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
5632,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room wasn't ready due to a jehovah's witness convention,2
5633,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
5634,no way we were paying more for accommodation we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm,2
5635,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel were nice but the room is so noisy,2
5636,i stayed at this hotel for business i asked the guy at the desk said ok like it wasn't a big deal,2
5637,older hotel with stain on the carpet and just a feeling that the cleaning crew was not up to par with others in the area,2
5638,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
5639,the interior is from the 70's all the way down but 74 maybe 72 is the best you'll be getting,2
5640,told receptionist about it and they didn't clean the room for us we stayed 2 nights,2
5641,room was clean but this hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
5642,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
5643,ok for just a one night stay for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
5644,when i asked about it i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
5645,they came and changed it and it was so bad and disgusting we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
5646,when i complained about it in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
5647,the real problem however was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
5648,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
5649,i guess i was disappointed because they told me it'd be returned if i didn't use it,2
5650,that made this disappointing stay a bit easier to swallow but i will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future,2
5651,the room was okay but the hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which was very loud,2
5652,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was more of a condo which was nice,2
5653,not convenient if your on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
5654,i hate the fremont street area but the price was reasonable and we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
5655,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
5656,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
5657,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
5658,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
5659,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
5660,thankfully we didn't stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight,2
5661,my family and i were in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
5662,it was very unpleasant and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
5663,cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
5664,staff was rude and didn't seem super clean,2
5665,i stayed at hotel five years ago but it is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
5666,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was old and looked like it needed to be vacuumed,2
5667,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and discovered it the following morning,2
5668,like i said we were right off the street and you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room,2
5669,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
5670,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast,2
5671,bed was comfortable staff was very friendly but the first room i was placed in looked like something out of a horror movie,2
5672,this was not our first choice in ely but it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
5673,by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
5674,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of renovating,2
5675,we only stayed 1 night because it was so slippery only to find out that my room hadn't been cleaned by the maids,2
5676,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel again,2
5677,at least the location is very convenient to the marathon area,2
5678,when we arrived to the hotel we thought it was a hostel but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
5679,utensils were available but you have to ask the front desk for hand towels they gave me a double bed room,2
5680,this was the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
5681,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
5682,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the room closest to the road,2
5683,all around its a decent room but definitely not for the price i probably wouldn't stay here again,2
5684,we were going to and it had a film on top of the messy sheets,2
5685,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
5686,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there,2
5687,room smelled of smoke even though this is supposedly a non-smoking room from what i understood,2
5688,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was dirty,2
5689,i called down to the front desk and was told maint,2
5690,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on it's location to the sawgrass mills mall,2
5691,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
5692,i booked two rooms and they only had me down for king bed when i had specifically requested two doubles,2
5693,the room was pretty nice but the bathroom definitely needs to be updated just like the rest of the guests in his charge,2
5694,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios,2
5695,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel at least 3 times this year,2
5696,it's not the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't enough enough to use for just myself let alone 4 people,2
5697,for the price the room could have been a lot better if customer service was taken more seriously,2
5698,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
5699,great location to everything and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
5700,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
5701,the breakfast was great but the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
5702,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel again,2
5703,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
5704,glad we only stayed for a few hours for maintenance,2
5705,the good thing was the rooms were clean but just needed alot of updating,2
5706,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
5707,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had already paid,2
5708,the air-conditioning system is ancient and stopped working in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
5709,bed was comfortable and the room did not have the room that someone booked over a month ago,2
5710,the room was comfortable which was nice i was able to walk in without a reservation at the country inns suites hotel,2
5711,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2
5712,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a busy weekend and lots of places were full,2
5713,hotel itself was okay but the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
5714,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
5715,we checked in after 3 and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
5716,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
5717,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
5718,budge was right but condition of the hotel was because they were in the process of remodeling,2
5719,there was one person working at the front desk and they apologized and that was about it,2
5720,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room for one night on a road trip,2
5721,only only only plus for this hotel is the 20minute walk to arch de triomphe and champs lyses,2
5722,housekeeping was very friendly and polite but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
5723,the non-smoking rooms were on one side of the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting,2
5724,finally we moved to a different room during a very busy weekend for them and the staff was very welcoming and friendly,2
5725,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
5726,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
5727,walls are thin and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
5728,i have stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
5729,forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right during our possible next stay,2
5730,it also needed better cleaning and the phone didn't work at all,2
5731,no towels in the room and the smell was even worse,2
5732,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
5733,at least the staff on the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
5734,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
5735,it turns out it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in nicer places for less in the past,2
5736,when we got back to the hotel on your own,2
5737,i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
5738,in calling the front desk i called the hotel and they said it wasn't ready,2
5739,we had an early adventure they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
5740,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
5741,the lady at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the price,2
5742,we selected the hotel because of the shape of this one,2
5743,when we informed the staff of the issues but the sticker was still there when we checked out at 10 am,2
5744,the front desk worker was really rude when we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
5745,the power points fall out of the wall burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bath you can tell,2
5746,it really sucked the room was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly,2
5747,if your looking for okay rates and just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
5748,whilst we my husband and i have stayed at this hotel many times over the last few years,2
5749,he seemed to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door,2
5750,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room was not vacuumed,2
5751,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone in the future,2
5752,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and left immediately,2
5753,the service was very slow and struggled felt like it was in the worst location in the complex except the unfortunate people below us,2
5754,there were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
5755,during the stay the room was very smellly i had to open up the back stick my hand in and correct the problem,2
5756,the only good thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke as you enter the hotel and the neighborhood,2
5757,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
5758,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was not very clean,2
5759,the bed was more like a motel 6,2
5760,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
5761,during the second night i woke up with a sore back each morning,2
5762,they only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the street,2
5763,the first room was in bad need of repair,2
5764,we told them again and they said they would take care of it ourselves,2
5765,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
5766,they did re-room us and staff was nice and the kitchen clean,2
5767,beside the fact that the front desk is boxed with glass,2
5768,the gym was probably one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this hotel,2
5769,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
5770,i was with my kids and when we got there but no reason to roll your eyes at us,2
5771,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
5772,the hotel room was small and old and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
5773,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a busy weekend and lots of places were full,2
5774,all in all i was very disappointed with the hotel,2
5775,good for simply having a place to sleep this one will do,2
5776,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
5777,i was surprised at the condition of the hotel was drab,2
5778,staff was nice nice location but the room was generally in bad shape,2
5779,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
5780,the customer service when we checked in close to midnight,2
5781,called the front desk for hand towels they gave me a double bed room instead,2
5782,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
5783,the view was nice i was able to check in at 3 as promised because thee power was out,2
5784,they said we couldn't use that,2
5785,on check out it was noted that you had to go sit in reception,2
5786,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
5787,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
5788,and the hotel is very old and very run down,2
5789,there was no electrical outlets with the cord dangling ridiculous we had to set it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
5790,tried to go back to the front desk clerk had to check people in clean rooms and take care of the paperwork,2
5791,i asked to be moved the lady on the phone said it hadn't even been vacuumed,2
5792,the rooms where dated it smelled one tv did not work properly door stuck making it hard to fall asleep,2
5793,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
5794,when we got there and our room was on the 2nd floor,2
5795,the bedspreads smelled the worst and there were a few minor problems like the drainage on the tub and sink,2
5796,our room could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
5797,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
5798,i think this was an old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
5799,but the last time i stayed at this hotel a few times and will not do so again,2
5800,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be back,2
5801,needless to say we will not be staying there again,2
5802,no towels in the room when i come to these types of places to house their people,2
5803,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
5804,i was also puzzled at the lack of control the hotel staff had hand-written our credit card number,2
5805,carb city and i would do yourself a favor and book another hotel,2
5806,way too much for what you get your paying a lot,2
5807,i had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
5808,this was only a place to stay where we felt safe,2
5809,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
5810,the bath room was clean and the bed was comfy,2
5811,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
5812,when i checked in i asked for a king size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house,2
5813,the staff for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
5814,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
5815,bird droppings all over back entry that was closest to our room smelled of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
5816,the door to the bathroom didn't have a microwave in the room,2
5817,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at this hotel was short of expectations,2
5818,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
5819,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for one night,2
5820,in the middle of the night and it was on a week night,2
5821,price was very good and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
5822,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the stairs,2
5823,00 for my room for one night and this was through,2
5824,i booked a smoking room and it wasn't worth going,2
5825,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
5826,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
5827,if this is the way to please your guests we will be staying there next time for sure,2
5828,no hot water in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
5829,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
5830,for the price range it was a great experience this year not so much,2
5831,so if you want any sleep don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
5832,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
5833,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
5834,the fitness room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
5835,we had an issue with noisy neighbors in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
5836,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
5837,but the 3rd day i called in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
5838,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
5839,location is great easy to find right off the interstate if you're traveling through,2
5840,the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
5841,the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
5842,there was a roach in my room there was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
5843,for 90 a night the room was small and did not have enough to give,2
5844,i was surprised at the condition of the hotel and focus on that,2
5845,the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean,2
5846,everything looked fine until my 3 year old found an empty soda bottle under the bed and all around the room corners,2
5847,air leaks around the sliding glass door didn't lock appropriately,2
5848,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
5849,staff was very friendly but the first room i was placed in looked like something out of a fun house,2
5850,very difficult to get a good night's sleep over all,2
5851,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean enough and the decor matched the lobby and hallways,2
5852,front desk reception was friendly and courteous but the room was clean but in need of updates,2
5853,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
5854,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
5855,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
5856,i didn't like that the pool was not available for use even though it was non-refundable,2
5857,would never stay at this hotel in the summer,2
5858,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
5859,the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
5860,i had to go to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
5861,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
5862,sliding doors in our room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are crazy comfortable,2
5863,we chose this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is close to the train station,2
5864,alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open,2
5865,alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
5866,the place needs a lot of work to do,2
5867,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
5868,because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
5869,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take are own trash,2
5870,it was run down dirty the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but did the next day when i,2
5871,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
5872,ok for a one night stay for the price but don't expect much,2
5873,we were there to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
5874,ok for just a one night stay for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
5875,the tv was very old and very stained,2
5876,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but everything was old and ragged,2
5877,guess they were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was fine,2
5878,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
5879,we asked for a room on the first floor in a handicap room,2
5880,when checking in we asked for a king size bed,2
5881,the bathtub had some stains and it was hard to get the water hot,2
5882,someone came and changed the filter which was black is was so dirty and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
5883,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
5884,when i first entered the room was okay but could have been cleaner,2
5885,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
5886,i wish i had asked her name as she was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
5887,weird part 1 was the second room did not have the problem,2
5888,when i first entered the room was okay but could have been cleaner,2
5889,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
5890,they were nice enough to remember to give it to me when i checked in the bed was a big negative,2
5891,i just hate that i had to get up and have his whole bottom and socks covered in white fur,2
5892,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
5893,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
5894,they just gave the usual response that their rooms are clean and they have a little play area for young kids there,2
5895,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
5896,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
5897,this place is not worth the money that i spent,2
5898,the bathroom was dirty and the room was exceptional small,2
5899,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the room just looked dirty,2
5900,i checked in tuesday at 6:00 pm wednesday i had to wait til 8 am to take a hot shower,2
5901,this time the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was still supposed to be open,2
5902,the problem with the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
5903,the check in staff was very friendly a big plus,2
5904,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was chilly outside i turned on the lights,2
5905,we booked this on a last minute deals website for 48,2
5906,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
5907,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel if you are a senior,2
5908,we would not stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
5909,the room was nice and it was clean and refreshing,2
5910,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach it's workable,2
5911,first of all i booked this room for the night,2
5912,well i thought cockroaches in the room was very nice however the walls were very thin,2
5913,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a wild loud adventure with your kids go for it,2
5914,everyone was nice and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
5915,as we were checking out another couple was complaining to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
5916,the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money,2
5917,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room that smelled like smoke,2
5918,in calling the front desk someone signed off that my room had been cleaned and the screen on the window was torn,2
5919,the hotel was very empty and our room was not cleaned after the last guests,2
5920,it took receptionist almost an hour to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties,2
5921,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
5922,we booked it following great reviews and the only thing i liked about it was the beds were comfortable and room was clean,2
5923,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
5924,i think this will be the first and last time i will stay here,2
5925,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
5926,so i have no idea how this had an excellent rating,2
5927,upon my request both were replaced and we were offered no type of compensation from the hotel,2
5928,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
5929,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
5930,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
5931,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
5932,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
5933,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
5934,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and not as clean as our last visit,2
5935,the first peculiar thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
5936,i stayed at knight's inn for 3 nights while visiting my son thanksgiving,2
5937,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
5938,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
5939,i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again even though it seems to be worse then the last,2
5940,we probably wont be staying here again,2
5941,not even on nice hotels they call to kick us out for a couple of hours before the wedding i was attending,2
5942,it was also very noisy on the front of the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
5943,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
5944,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
5945,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
5946,the room i have to say i didn't sleep at all,2
5947,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there and throughout our stay,2
5948,the staff was very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
5949,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
5950,hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been updated since the 80s then this is the place,2
5951,it was very safe and comfortable and i would stay again only if i had to,2
5952,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip,2
5953,what scared me the most was the fact they also served,2
5954,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the poconos they either need to change,2
5955,my flight landed around 7 pm and i was leaving the next morning it was a clean room and good nights sleep,2
5956,elevator didn't work and we had to ask for one and the host laughed at me,2
5957,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
5958,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
5959,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was comfy,2
5960,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to open the windows when i first got in,2
5961,it is in a convenient stop-over location on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my ac duct,2
5962,the first receptionist sent me to talk with expedia were i made the reservation but got a parking lot view room,2
5963,staff was very friendly but the first room i was placed in had a heating unit that did not work and nautilus weight machine,2
5964,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
5965,there was no sunlight to be found and the access to the pool was not heated and the hot tub was not in use,2
5966,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
5967,we stayed here for 2 nights and the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
5968,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
5969,we soon discovered there was no way to air it out,2
5970,breakfast was very good we had a large corner room with two queen beds to one bed and a small bathroom,2
5971,people talking outside sounded like they were in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
5972,we got the room keys and the room was relatively clean but not in good repair,2
5973,the area did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
5974,i would consider going back there if it was a cheap place to stay so you don't have a bed for you,2
5975,room was ok for the price only stayed one night but still disappointed,2
5976,my family and i have stayed at better motel 6 motels,2
5977,i was surprised at the condition of the hotel was because they were in the process of remodeling,2
5978,for the price i had to pay an additional 40,2
5979,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
5980,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
5981,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
5982,could use some work seemed clean but there were a few small maintenance issues,2
5983,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend or stay here ever again,2
5984,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
5985,bathroom was dirty and the room was horrible when we told the staff they said they would take,2
5986,juice machine broken had to ask for extra towels each night,2
5987,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
5988,i arrived at night and drove up and down the street from the metro,2
5989,they were painting the exterior of the building is closed off it appears,2
5990,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and very stained,2
5991,the fire detector was broken and the bathtub was dirty,2
5992,still looks bad 6 days later and all they said was they would talk with the manager over housekeeping,2
5993,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
5994,there was hair on the floor and it did not happen,2
5995,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
5996,also the bed was very comfortable and the room was extremely outdated,2
5997,i asked the front desk and they told us they would get going on finishing it up,2
5998,after 3 calls to the front desk we were told,2
5999,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
6000,the were so bad it was hard to get what we needed,2
6001,second time i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
6002,traveling by myself i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
6003,limited supply of hot water in the shower the same could not be said for the room sink,2
6004,it is truly run down and not as clean as it should be,2
6005,continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
6006,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western downtown nashville on our way back north,2
6007,and to top it off my family and i stayed here so that we could sleep well,2
6008,we were happy with our choice as the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
6009,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
6010,the elevator wasn't working the first night and i had the room closest to the road,2
6011,i was surprised at the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect from best western,2
6012,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
6013,the room was small and old and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
6014,we had a room with only a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and left immediately,2
6015,furhter the hotel advertised free internet what we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the hallways was very disturbing,2
6016,it was my first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
6017,there was no contenental breakfast not that i would have to go back to the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
6018,the remote did not work in my room,2
6019,we then had to move our tired children and all of our personal items computers phones etc,2
6020,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
6021,the staff was great but the room was clean and the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
6022,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
6023,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
6024,we used a hotels giftcard so the stay was free i don't have a bed for you,2
6025,the air conditioning wasnt working next room looked like it was from the 60's,2
6026,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
6027,i was given room facing the street however this room's bathroom had not been cleaned in weeks,2
6028,i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
6029,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
6030,when he entered the original room the beds were not very comfortable scratchy sheets and blankets,2
6031,the condition of the room for the night and that they were no more rooms available,2
6032,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out we and a few other guests stood at the front desk,2
6033,room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
6034,was not aware until check that the only room available for the price that we paid,2
6035,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
6036,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
6037,the hotel and our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
6038,well i don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
6039,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a safe in the room but it was ok for the price only stayed one night,2
6040,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
6041,in the morning of checkout there was what seemed to be a lot of vagrants but i never felt unsafe,2
6042,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
6043,staff was pleasant at check-in about the policy,2
6044,we soon found out that our room had a crack large enough to see through,2
6045,hotel smelled of sewage and the manager said it was the hotels policy then i called the hotel from my phone,2
6046,00 upon arrival when the room was supposed to be a weekend getaway,2
6047,i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
6048,the area did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
6049,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to figure out how to fix it on our own,2
6050,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was a huge disappointment and very deceiving on the hotels part,2
6051,when i complained to the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
6052,i've never had that experience with any other hotel i've stayed at the courtyard down the street and decided to try staying here,2
6053,one hotel room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they were super busy and short staffed,2
6054,i have always like laquinta inns but i found out that it wasn't a king size bed which was comfortable,2
6055,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
6056,the hotel room was more clean it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets,2
6057,there were ants all over the bathroom floor,2
6058,it was next to the door and the hotel is not upto us standards,2
6059,there was no electrical outlets with the cord dangling ridiculous we had to set it and it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
6060,the deadbolt on the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
6061,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the beds in our room was attacked by bed bugs,2
6062,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
6063,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
6064,will not be returning to this hotel was a mixed bag,2
6065,the online pictures were deceiving but the location was great right off of i90 and very easy to find,2
6066,when i got in the room i guess,2
6067,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the shuttle was not going to be a pleasant stay,2
6068,needless to say we will not be staying there ever again,2
6069,when we got to our room the odor was awful,2
6070,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel in the future,2
6071,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
6072,so we stopped by the front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in an area of richmond that is less than desirable,2
6073,after working out and returning to our room we were met with an oh,2
6074,for an extra couple of we could have stayed but it certainly wasn't glamorous,2
6075,what scared me the most was the fact they also served,2
6076,a bit pricey for what you get but there aren't many hotels in this area to go here again,2
6077,we really never even felt part of the hotel and the rooms were old,2
6078,the room was decent and the breakfast was not that great,2
6079,next business trip will not stay here again as the price was economical,2
6080,parkside inn's indoor pool had algae on the walls and bottom of the pool and the hot tub,2
6081,we checked into what was supposed to ge a clean room,2
6082,it's a lot of work to do,2
6083,everyone was nice and polite but the room had dirty comforters and had to be replaced,2
6084,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
6085,we went to the coast and i didn't get any wifi at all,2
6086,when we checked in the staff was unfriendly and felt like we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
6087,the chair in the room had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
6088,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
6089,the staff was pleasant at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
6090,the sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
6091,the room smelled very musty and the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
6092,we spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the rooms it guesst should be give more relaxed comfort,2
6093,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
6094,one of the comforters had dried blood on it there was hair on the wall in the bathroom still there when we left,2
6095,a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was clean but ordinary showing signs of wear and tear,2
6096,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
6097,you can hear conversations of the room next door tv until 3 am,2
6098,stay here if you have no alternative and just need a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
6099,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
6100,there were stains all over the floor in the bathroom,2
6101,the staff was nice and friendly but the room was a nonsmoking room but the hallways and foyer reeked of smoke,2
6102,but it was close to an event we were going to destroy their property,2
6103,my beef is with the front desk staff was polite and friendly location is good,2
6104,first impression is that is overpriced for what you get but there aren't many hotels in this area to go here again,2
6105,get a room with a shared bathroom,2
6106,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
6107,at 5:00 am i called the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
6108,registered and was not told there was no water in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
6109,overall stay was ok but not anything great,2
6110,the carpet was extremely old and looked like they were 20 years old,2
6111,worse than that she told me that i didn't go off on her,2
6112,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and a bathroom and was,2
6113,and cars went screeching by at all hours of the morning after a night out with friends,2
6114,great place to go if you are looking for a suite at this hotel there are significant incoveniences,2
6115,the rate was average for a place of this type but i've stayed at hotel monaco before and it was great,2
6116,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
6117,the tv remote had some sort of stain on the sheets,2
6118,really don't know who added the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible,2
6119,the was clean and the supplies were in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
6120,i made our reservations for 3 rooms but was not told the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
6121,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the two room suite is located off the main room not,2
6122,the only positive thing i can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
6123,this is not a corporate location and i could tell by the customer service when we checked in and kids couldn't use it,2
6124,we checked in for one night to go to a restaurant for 1 1 2 hours to finish my work,2
6125,couldn't wait to get out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
6126,price was the best thing about the hotel,2
6127,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to be moving,2
6128,overall i was very unhappy when we got there and throughout our stay,2
6129,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios,2
6130,general appearance of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach and nearby restaurants,2
6131,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
6132,the sink was clogged and the front door did not lock and the window blinds on the exterior wall,2
6133,air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed for renovation,2
6134,we called early in the day so even,2
6135,the continental breakfast was okay but they were out of regular coffee,2
6136,sorry but we will not be staying here ever again,2
6137,the dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was generally okay nothing to write home about,2
6138,we stayed 1 night at this hotel because of the location the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
6139,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
6140,ok but don't think i would stay again only if i had to,2
6141,over all the hotel is a little worn,2
6142,when i booked i ordered a non-smoking room smelled like smoke,2
6143,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and living room,2
6144,budge was right but condition of the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
6145,beside the fact that the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
6146,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed and pillow were comfortable however the room was a problem,2
6147,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
6148,if all you need is a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
6149,our door did not work and we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
6150,at least there was a second sink in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
6151,the room was very small and very noisy from the upstairs rooms and the traffic along the upstairs and downstairs corridors,2
6152,they want you to record your life at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
6153,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and the staff were helpful,2
6154,almost had to get in shower to close bath door and i am a heavy sleeper it was not a buffet style breakfast,2
6155,i walked in the room and i was refused,2
6156,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
6157,online i was informed this was the only room available for the price that we paid,2
6158,next morning the breakfast was good but this hotel is in a terrible location,2
6159,when i went in to complain i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
6160,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but the hotel was dirty and poorly maintained,2
6161,we were there for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
6162,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
6163,failed to tell us the heater needed plugged in so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
6164,overall not bad just could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
6165,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
6166,i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
6167,lighting in the room was nice and clean,2
6168,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
6169,when i went in to complain i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
6170,then the night they left the fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am,2
6171,if the management knew it was not going to be there besides to sleep it will do,2
6172,tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the next morning there was still only 1 front desk assistant,2
6173,when i checked in the guy in the front desk clerk i was simply told i'll tell my manager about it,2
6174,the entrance doors were not locked and as we entered through the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
6175,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
6176,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes,2
6177,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
6178,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
6179,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
6180,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and no one was available at any time,2
6181,during the stay the room was very stuffy all night,2
6182,usually we stay the legoland resort but we wanted to be close to sonoma napa on a saturday night,2
6183,the room was not as advertised and for some reason the maint man wasn't around the next day,2
6184,my daughter slept in one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
6185,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
6186,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
6187,there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom so i wasn't about to try dinner,2
6188,never heard of this but i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
6189,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
6190,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
6191,there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't working properly when i was there very disappointing,2
6192,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
6193,i can say that the staff was very nice and helpful,2
6194,i booked a room with 2 double beds,2
6195,the check in was quick so we were able to check in to a different hotel after midnight,2
6196,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
6197,the man clerk at the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
6198,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
6199,the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
6200,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
6201,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
6202,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
6203,the wifi did not work well so we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
6204,it was hard to be annoyed at the lack of lotion and pen in the room,2
6205,overall it was a clean room and that is just creepy,2
6206,but the room were clean and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
6207,i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all,2
6208,sent me to the room several times i couldn't get one because i didn't have any,2
6209,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
6210,even though i had not requested it and i had to use my towel to soak it up,2
6211,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money if you come early,2
6212,the bath room was clean and staff was nice and helpful but the king bed was terrible,2
6213,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
6214,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
6215,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
6216,no way we were paying more for accommodation we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm,2
6217,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
6218,the bed was not made the comforter was only on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
6219,when we first walked into our room there was only one large towel the one for the floor and two face towels,2
6220,we hope they did not need this room for someone with walking handicap because i had to attend a funeral,2
6221,second night people yelling in the hallways in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
6222,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
6223,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and filthy with,2
6224,although cheap i was still disappointed especially since it still reeked of smoke even though it was a non-smoking room,2
6225,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
6226,the breakfast was nice and the price was reasonable so i tempered my expectations,2
6227,i don't like having to go to the gas station to get bags of ice,2
6228,i knew this was a low star rated hotel but i didn't want to find another place,2
6229,the lady gave me a double bed when i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
6230,first i know they are slowly renovating but they have a lot of money if you come early,2
6231,tried to go back to the same rental,2
6232,i found that our room had been there,2
6233,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
6234,the only plus was that it was close to the event we were attending,2
6235,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
6236,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway and our rooms were still not ready,2
6237,it was creepy and it was so dirty and did something else but nothing changed,2
6238,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
6239,looks better with the online pics needs to be updated just like the rest of the room was very basic,2
6240,the gentleman who was at the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
6241,but i was in the elevator and there was a small amount of fried rice on the bed spread,2
6242,when we arrived to check in i was told that there was only one elevator,2
6243,the people at the front desk was located,2
6244,i have stayed there many times in the past but will probably try somewhere else next time,2
6245,the location of the room i was told they cancelled the trip offering nothing in return,2
6246,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the door and the toilet leaked,2
6247,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days although is in a very convenient location,2
6248,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
6249,this was my second stay at this hotel was enough too far from glacier park entrance,2
6250,please do not stay at this property again,2
6251,in the bathroom of the first room we were put in wasn't much better,2
6252,but it's a property in need of a good update in the general areas,2
6253,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
6254,it turns out it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in this brand hotel before and were very pleased,2
6255,i was in a room with no difference,2
6256,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk 2x and it took 45 minutes to have someone come spray the room,2
6257,no one was ever at the front desk were very nice the guy in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
6258,i thought that you could have up to 5 in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
6259,our room smelled so bad that i had to change rooms because our water heater was not functioning properly,2
6260,traveling alone and needed room for one night and this was through,2
6261,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk house keeping came only change one bed sheets was very disappointed,2
6262,the indoor pool and hot tub the hot tub was not in use,2
6263,there seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby chairs watching tv,2
6264,there is an odor upon entering the room it was a disaster,2
6265,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had already paid for my room via expidia,2
6266,it stink i had to go to the lobby for coffee in the morning,2
6267,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
6268,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
6269,would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door,2
6270,when we checked in later we were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning,2
6271,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
6272,do not expect much for breakfast same items everyday and not a lot of hotels in the area so not much to pick from,2
6273,do not stay here if you have no alternative and just need a place to sleep this will suffice,2
6274,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
6275,it has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners the ac didn't work and the owner refused to give us another room,2
6276,due to great driving conditions my wife and i were in nc for a funeral,2
6277,please do not stay at this hotel again and do not plan on using howard johnson again,2
6278,staff was nice but we went from a room with two double beds like we asked for anything out of the ordinary,2
6279,beds need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
6280,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
6281,needless to say i am never going to stay in this hotel ever again,2
6282,there was lipstick on one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
6283,the knob was off the heater and we couldn't move because that is where your organization put us,2
6284,the in-room safe was locked so you can't even cool down after a long day,2
6285,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is,2
6286,we attempted to get a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so dirty,2
6287,pretty clean except i don't think that is an appropriate,2
6288,even when you are in town for a marathon and they did not act on it immediately,2
6289,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast,2
6290,when we checked in we were told the parking lot was over flowing for 2 days,2
6291,this is the third time i have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
6292,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the walls,2
6293,the room was dirty and the room was still to hot,2
6294,kind of like walmart if you don't have to drag my with me,2
6295,also the phone in my room did not have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
6296,no way we were paying more for accommodation we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm,2
6297,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
6298,i stayed in berkeley 40 just for one day and we did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
6299,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
6300,would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the cape,2
6301,the room had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
6302,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
6303,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
6304,when i booked i ordered a non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2
6305,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
6306,the bath room was clean and nicely furnished,2
6307,upside is there is a doughnut shop right next to the pillow beds are to short for tall over 6'3 people,2
6308,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
6309,i asked for a king bed room,2
6310,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
6311,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up,2
6312,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet the bathroom door had split apart and never been repaired,2
6313,i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing,2
6314,it actually made it very difficult for me to navigate my way to the casino lobby and eventually found someone working,2
6315,didn't know we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
6316,the check in staff was very friendly and polite but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
6317,the visit was for one night and this was through,2
6318,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to another,2
6319,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been cooler at the front of the door and the toilet leaked,2
6320,the history of this hotel is below acceptable,2
6321,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
6322,first problem was finding the front door the hotel is located was horrible due to massive road construction projects,2
6323,out the front door the hotel is located in a business park area,2
6324,hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
6325,this place is in need of an overhaul,2
6326,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was over flowing for 2 days,2
6327,when i got to my room and that they were no more rooms available,2
6328,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
6329,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel we only stayed three nights,2
6330,a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
6331,i'm never going to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
6332,we called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the resort was sold out for the night,2
6333,the room was not the best the owners were friendly and helpful,2
6334,the front staff was pleasant with the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked out at 10 am,2
6335,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been priced no more than 75 a day,2
6336,we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
6337,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
6338,i get to my room and that they were moving us to the room next door tv until 3 am,2
6339,i asked for a king size bed which was comfortable,2
6340,but we knew it had closed down so when i booked this hotel a few times and will not do so again,2
6341,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
6342,the hot tub on the first night when i returned to the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
6343,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was occupied,2
6344,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt which is not,2
6345,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
6346,i would say this hotel was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to shower and sleep,2
6347,we asked for management to move us to anything away from the smoke,2
6348,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
6349,we were very disappointed we had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
6350,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the two room suite is located off the main room not,2
6351,we selected the hotel because of the shape of this one,2
6352,we chose this hotel because it was a pretty nice property,2
6353,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff was very friendly accommodating,2
6354,it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
6355,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
6356,we felt like we were bothering him when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
6357,not enough towels in the room when we arrived and upon departure,2
6358,didn't exactly smell clean but more like they were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners,2
6359,the breakfast was good but this hotel is in bad condition and the sofa was torn and old,2
6360,we chose to eat out after the first night because i couldn't sleep because the ac is too old and loud,2
6361,the bathroom walls had paint missing and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
6362,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
6363,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
6364,the doors in the hallways are old and dirty,2
6365,it works for your needs but for the price and if you are staying for a single night it is probably ok,2
6366,i travel for a living and i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
6367,the continental breakfast was not worth the price,2
6368,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
6369,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
6370,the remote for the tv in the bedroom would not work and we had to be evacuated,2
6371,we were booked for 3 nights but the room was filthy,2
6372,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the poconos they either need to change,2
6373,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
6374,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
6375,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
6376,the doors need to be replaced old and worn out for a less than 5 yr old hotel,2
6377,we barely got a wink of sleep we were so disgusted and the bed was uncomfortable and pillows so bad i went and bought one,2
6378,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios,2
6379,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
6380,we had an early adventure they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
6381,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
6382,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
6383,the king size bed that was super hard,2
6384,the innisbrook resort didn't have a plunger for baths,2
6385,though the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
6386,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
6387,staff was very friendly very nice and it was clean and there was plenty of hot water,2
6388,the toilet looked like it had not been changed,2
6389,small refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip,2
6390,the toilet in the restroom didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
6391,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
6392,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though non smoking room,2
6393,for the price we paid i would not stay there again especially for 100,2
6394,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
6395,we had to figure out how to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32,2
6396,walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
6397,beds were comfortable and there was a floss utensil still sitting in the corner of the desk carrying eggs in their rear to lay somewhere,2
6398,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
6399,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got our room reasonably priced during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
6400,overall the room was fine and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible,2
6401,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
6402,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
6403,the room was very small and not clean,2
6404,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to crash,2
6405,the rate for the value is way out of line and have stayed in alot of different places,2
6406,they also checked the ac unit and pulled the filter while they were in the middle of nowhere 10 miles from the hotel,2
6407,positives sleeper sofa in the room was very stuffy all night,2
6408,the area did not feel safe at all,2
6409,worse i saw the hotel towels all over the floor the bathroom was dirty,2
6410,the customer service when we checked in close to midnight,2
6411,upon arrival we asked the front desk girl for a pen,2
6412,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
6413,if you are on a budget it will be okay but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
6414,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
6415,i was excited to stay at this hotel again and do not plan on using howard johnson again,2
6416,when i asked about it i was told that they would look into it but nothing was done,2
6417,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
6418,lobby breakfast area nice but the room is so noisy,2
6419,took some time to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
6420,the room was not very nice at all,2
6421,they refused to refund me for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
6422,i have stayed at this hotel 3 times,2
6423,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
6424,old hotel in need of updating room smelled musty but it was a busy weekend and lots of places were full,2
6425,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was not in use,2
6426,i will use this hotel again if i don't have a problem with roaches,2
6427,the next thing was the explanation at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
6428,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
6429,that room was not very nice at all,2
6430,front desk staff somewhat aloof initially sent us to a room at the back prepare for a lot of noise,2
6431,the property was quiet at night for the most part were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
6432,finally got a room in the same building,2
6433,i finally called the front desk and they put us in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
6434,i'm a platinum choice member so i didn't get any wifi at all,2
6435,there was no hot water in the shower,2
6436,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
6437,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
6438,but the sheets were dingy and the towels were the kind that they use in prisons,2
6439,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
6440,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
6441,the motel is very old and very stained,2
6442,anyway the food was mediocre and very expensive for what is a very basic hotel and the food is not great,2
6443,just was a awful hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
6444,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
6445,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though we booked a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
6446,the was clean and the bed was comfortable and the shower was dirty,2
6447,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
6448,if you are in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
6449,the gentleman who was at the front desk was not especially helpful,2
6450,best thing that i can say is the front desk staff were friendly,2
6451,and when i checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
6452,could hear tv all night in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
6453,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
6454,but when we got there we were put in it smelled horrible and like mildew,2
6455,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
6456,the people at that hotel were really nice but the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
6457,it looks old and run down but appeared to be clean however the room stunk,2
6458,our room was nice and it was clean and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible,2
6459,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was the only positive influence there,2
6460,check in was very slow bed was very uncomfortable for the first two nights,2
6461,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
6462,the room was decent and the breakfast was nice as was the area,2
6463,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
6464,my wife son and i stayed at this hotel because it was a pretty nice property,2
6465,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
6466,the motel is tidy and the room was still too warm,2
6467,they said there would be a pleasant atmosphere,2
6468,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
6469,i found out while staying in newburgh it has a very very basic breakfast and the hotel is very old no security box in rooms,2
6470,people were literally moving in on the day we arrived the hot tub was down for repairs,2
6471,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
6472,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff was very friendly accommodating,2
6473,i was surprised at the condition of the hotel and the neighborhood,2
6474,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to everything,2
6475,i called the front desk we had to wait n lobby awhile,2
6476,i will not stay at this hotel for several months due to it's location next to marina state beach and the high way,2
6477,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have a room for the bike ride,2
6478,clerk said they did not receive payment from hotel so i had to set it and it was fine,2
6479,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
6480,hotel was as you would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
6481,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and the bathroom could have been bigger,2
6482,make you go to the lobby to ask for it to be this bad,2
6483,turns out this is not a 3 star,2
6484,toilet plugged up no maintenance person on site front desk told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids,2
6485,the carpet and chair in the room was a complete turn off,2
6486,it should state the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe at all,2
6487,they will call the cops if you don't mind parking on the street,2
6488,it also says that the room hasn't been cleaned yet,2
6489,you can turn it all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
6490,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
6491,also after leaving for a family picnic in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
6492,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
6493,also the phone in my room did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
6494,the rate was 50 for our room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
6495,it hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
6496,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived to my room i had the smallest tube in the world,2
6497,there were ants all over the bathroom floor,2
6498,the staff were nice and friendly but the room was clammy,2
6499,we didn't stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight,2
6500,guess they were not happy with our stay,2
6501,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged so we reported it at 6 pm,2
6502,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
6503,when we entered the lobby to check out the pool and hot tub to find it was empty,2
6504,hotel staff was friendly breakfast was good but the service was bad,2
6505,we ended up leaving early and staying at the best western next door for the pool inn only has spa and something newer,2
6506,the check in person at first said we didn't have an over funky smell that permeated throughout the lobby and elevator,2
6507,so we headed right back to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
6508,there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom of the first room we were in the area for less money,2
6509,stayed here for one night on our way to florida and back,2
6510,broken bed garbage under one of the beds front staff was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
6511,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay tonight's i only stayed one,2
6512,the man behind the counter said that since i booked through expedia and my room was fine but my daughters room was awful,2
6513,the hotel employees for the most part were very friendly and helpful which was nice,2
6514,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
6515,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
6516,i told her i would be coming back very late that evening and i would move to another hotel if this was an issue,2
6517,when i asked about it i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
6518,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
6519,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom of the room we did stay in,2
6520,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
6521,then next day the staff didn't seem to care,2
6522,i should have went to front desk received another room,2
6523,the location was good as we were able to walk to all of the local attractions with ease,2
6524,a month before we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm a few days before our trip i was,2
6525,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
6526,after the first day i cam back from the beach to find out that the water pressure was very weak in shower,2
6527,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
6528,didn't like the fact that the front desk is 100,2
6529,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected,2
6530,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for each room,2
6531,we arrived late and the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
6532,the good news is that the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
6533,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was clean but halls looked dated and worn,2
6534,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
6535,the in-room safe was locked so you can't even cool down after a long day,2
6536,i use marriott a lot this is the first time i have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned,2
6537,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
6538,if you don't have to spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
6539,the clerk was very short and rude and didn't seem like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
6540,probably because there is no space in the room for a couple of years we returned to the hampton inn,2
6541,the place wasn't bad for the price but should have been much cheaper to match the quality,2
6542,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and dirty,2
6543,budge was right but condition of the hotel was because they were in the room,2
6544,positives sleeper sofa in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be blood splatter i know like call the fbi,2
6545,looks and acts like they don't want to spend a lot of money,2
6546,front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
6547,walls are extremely thin and i could hear the people talking in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
6548,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
6549,tried to move to another room and the mattress there was a little better than average,2
6550,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
6551,stayed here several times in the middle of the carpet,2
6552,terrible smell in the room and the smell was even worse,2
6553,this motel was not as clean as other hampton inns,2
6554,i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
6555,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
6556,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
6557,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
6558,one can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but this clarion was dirty,2
6559,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust on top of the cabinets towel rack picture frame,2
6560,tried staying here twice both times there was a problem with the stoe so no hot foods,2
6561,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
6562,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
6563,the only good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner worked and the tv worked,2
6564,ours was a non smoking room and hall smelled like smoke,2
6565,the first receptionist sent me to talk with expedia were i made the reservation but got a parking lot view room,2
6566,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
6567,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
6568,it was not at all clean the air conditioner did not work properly door stuck making it hard to open,2
6569,the air conditioner was cut off in the morning by the people in the room above me for the evening,2
6570,no one was ever at the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
6571,i have paid the same price before so i don't understand the hospitality industry at all,2
6572,we were driving late at night and needed a place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
6573,my husband was able to clear it but every time we had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet,2
6574,the fact that their were only about 6 cars in the parking lot it is it ok,2
6575,beds are bearable but don't expect much of them,2
6576,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
6577,by the next day we were not given any towels,2
6578,advertised a pool so brought kids suits sent them out come to find out they didn't separate the pet friendly rooms from non,2
6579,you get what you pay for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
6580,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
6581,the location is poor to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
6582,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
6583,overall stay was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but pool was not that warm,2
6584,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
6585,the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
6586,i was very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
6587,i thought the hotel was a bit run down and could use updating,2
6588,the heater unit makes a lot of noise throughout the entire night,2
6589,be aware we wanted to get a pick up to get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
6590,it is right up to the freeway but the road in front was loud,2
6591,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was always smiling and checking in to see,2
6592,they have a 60 swing in room prices and when asking the front desk if we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
6593,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
6594,the receptionist said they didn't have pens in the room i guess,2
6595,upon arrival we asked the front desk and told them i would have to tell you that i would rather sleep in my car,2
6596,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
6597,after explaining to him that we could not flip through to see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room,2
6598,i got to the hotel around 3:45 and was offered a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
6599,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but that was about it,2
6600,we had to call the front desk and was told maint,2
6601,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
6602,good for people who don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
6603,the tv didn't work in the room you had to go around to get inside,2
6604,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a small tv in the living room only,2
6605,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
6606,luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to sleep for the night while traveling,2
6607,the hotel and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
6608,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
6609,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
6610,after going back and forth they miraculously found a room to put us in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
6611,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell of smoke in a non-smoking hotel,2
6612,the front desk was not able to figure out how to fix it on our own,2
6613,hotel was clean front desk folks were friendly and helpful we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
6614,there were opened bars of soap stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
6615,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
6616,to start off with good the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
6617,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
6618,we were only in there to sleep but it's not nice still,2
6619,they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and debris under the ledge on the kitchen counter,2
6620,the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the carpet in the hallways was very disturbing,2
6621,some of the rooms have been updated but the hotel is in bad condition and the sofa was torn and old,2
6622,the pool was awesome but that's it i hated everything else,2
6623,one afternoon we asked for a non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
6624,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated in 20 years,2
6625,set in lush green mountains the location of this hotel is certainly showing hard bed small bathroom with plumbing issues,2
6626,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
6627,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
6628,the people at the desk were great but the room wasn't spectacular but could have used a little more tlc,2
6629,the sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
6630,i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
6631,later on used the pool and the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
6632,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
6633,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the hotel is attached to the greyhound station,2
6634,this hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which had tape over the 1 first floor button,2
6635,after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night as it was the cheapest way to be close to the miami airport,2
6636,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
6637,wifi did not work well so we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
6638,television was 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
6639,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was having a personal conversation with some guy,2
6640,won't be staying here again and i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
6641,i was moved to this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
6642,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
6643,not even on nice hotels they call to kick us out for a couple of hours but when i left there were only 3 people,2
6644,our non-smoking room smelled like smoke and didn't even tell us to enjoy or stay or such,2
6645,the windows had not been cleaned the sheets on the bed were very small like a travel size pillow,2
6646,we checked into the hotel late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
6647,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
6648,i would say this hotel was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
6649,if i didn't have any available,2
6650,staff was nice nice location but the room was not very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful,2
6651,walls extremely thin you can hear everything through the walls,2
6652,visible black mold in the bathroom in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there,2
6653,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
6654,the bathroom had some hair on the floor in the bathroom like the floor had not been swept either,2
6655,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
6656,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of it,2
6657,i thought it was a cheap place to stay so you don't,2
6658,check-in took about 45 minutes to check in,2
6659,when we arrived there was no one booked in the room above me so i knew someone was up there,2
6660,the complete hotel is in a terrible location,2
6661,though the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
6662,however the room was a little bigger than the king size bed had 2 small shams,2
6663,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
6664,replaced tv when we went to the room it did not appear to be clean,2
6665,i returned to the front desk but not other beverages,2
6666,i went back to the front desk and was advised there were no 1bedrooms available,2
6667,i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay there again on my next trip in two years,2
6668,the hotel is ridiculously overpriced and is no better than a motel 6 or red carpet inn,2
6669,even though i had not requested it and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
6670,please do not stay at this location again,2
6671,later found out the front desk staff was friendly,2
6672,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
6673,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to another,2
6674,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
6675,had to leave the hotel because it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
6676,non smoking room and the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
6677,the house keep called in the morning left for the day and returned 7 pm,2
6678,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
6679,we were so tired in the morning and was luke warm at best,2
6680,front staff were friendly and helpful we were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room,2
6681,we were in town for a conference and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
6682,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff when we checked in close to midnight,2
6683,i booked a room with two queen beds,2
6684,the reception staff was friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend as a hotel for a get away,2
6685,the hotel room was dirty and the room was still warm,2
6686,no way we were paying more for accommodation we were supposed to arrive i called to confirm a few days before our trip i was,2
6687,is a bar but it is not a boutique hotel as the sign says,2
6688,upon checking the front desk person about it,2
6689,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is great and delivers on promise,2
6690,after waiting about 15 minutes for my turn there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
6691,had to go to the front desk for the hotel across the parking lot,2
6692,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
6693,the air conditioning in the room and bobby pin on the bathroom floor and we found someones left over mcchicken in the microwave,2
6694,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
6695,when i called down for assistance i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
6696,carpet is in desperate need of an update,2
6697,breakfast area way too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
6698,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
6699,the location was nice and the breakfast was nice and the staff were super friendly,2
6700,overall the room was fine we were excited about having breakfast in the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
6701,i was disappointed in the size of the room was great for the deal but the room had dirty comforters and had to be fixed,2
6702,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i couldn't believe it,2
6703,expedia messed up reservation booked a family of four into a room with a queen bed and bath and tv,2
6704,we talked to the front desk to get another room,2
6705,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
6706,guess they were not happy with our stay,2
6707,guess they were not happy with the room not private the sink was out in the room which was not handled well by the hotel,2
6708,i would consider going back there if it was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
6709,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
6710,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
6711,the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
6712,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room was on the 2nd floor right above the grill area,2
6713,room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
6714,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees,2
6715,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
6716,reserved through hotels late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
6717,the front desk refused to take any responsibility blaming expedia despite the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
6718,to start off with good the front desk staff are the highlight of the stay,2
6719,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
6720,later on used the pool and there were no towels at the pool either,2
6721,it was ok for a one night stay but we won't return,2
6722,would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel again,2
6723,beds are the smallest doubles i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
6724,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
6725,unfortunately the pool and hot tub is nice,2
6726,first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
6727,it's fine for a low-budget hotel and i did not feel that the room was basically clean,2
6728,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
6729,called in the morning and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
6730,it was just a place to get some rest is all,2
6731,and when i checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
6732,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
6733,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
6734,they did move us to the other side of the hotel you have trains,2
6735,it stink i had to go to the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
6736,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
6737,hot tub pool area was very nice but the rest of the place,2
6738,for what we paid for our night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
6739,when i booked i ordered a non-smoking room and the staff would not change it,2
6740,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep and shower,2
6741,the staff at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a reservation and found it after 15 minutes,2
6742,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
6743,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
6744,you wouldn't know this if you don't mind parking on the street,2
6745,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk alone on his first day,2
6746,i called hotels and got it straightened out but it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
6747,we had to sleep with no covers because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
6748,but i won't be staying at this hotel again unless it had,2
6749,you get what you pay for these days so if you don't care about the customer service you will have a nice stay,2
6750,we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room kept me up all night snoring,2
6751,was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights,2
6752,had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
6753,the hotel was very empty and our room was on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
6754,99 each night for 2 nights and the room was still to hot,2
6755,there was a broken lamp in our room and we had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
6756,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for a place to crash,2
6757,i requested a non-smoking room in-room coffee and location,2
6758,they did move us to the other side of the hotel then i had requested,2
6759,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
6760,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
6761,we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
6762,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here for sure,2
6763,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far worse than any other stay,2
6764,the floor had not been cleaned in weeks,2
6765,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
6766,although the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and the next one had dry urine all over the toilet seat,2
6767,at least the staff on the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent,2
6768,front staff were friendly and helpful we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants,2
6769,it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
6770,the staff were nice and friendly but the room wasn't really that clean,2
6771,i also asked for a room upgrade and were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
6772,i called the front desk and request it,2
6773,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was a joke,2
6774,stayed here several times in the middle of july is kind of important,2
6775,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
6776,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to get a plastic fork so i could eat my dinner,2
6777,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads and rest,2
6778,i chose this hotel because is was 100 cheaper than the holiday inn express we have stayed in hotel before around 3 years ago,2
6779,the hotel is clean but to noisy for me and the only thing i save is the location,2
6780,so overflow is supposed to park in the garage the first time,2
6781,very disappointed and would not stay here when we return,2
6782,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is not an embassy suites,2
6783,the television is one of the better ones,2
6784,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't stay there again,2
6785,however when i called the hotel to ask about it they were very rude also again the next day when i was checking out,2
6786,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
6787,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was comfortable and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
6788,they did put me in a room that seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
6789,then the night they left the fire alarm went off for more than an overnight stay,2
6790,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything,2
6791,front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were in a king bed smoking,2
6792,i reserved a room with two beds available,2
6793,i asked the front desk for guests,2
6794,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
6795,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was not cleaned after the last guests,2
6796,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
6797,i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
6798,my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more,2
6799,the pool water was a freezing but the room was overpriced for the value,2
6800,i stayed at hotel five years ago but it is run down and needs a great deal of tlc,2
6801,it was awful and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give me one,2
6802,upon check-in i tried to confirm that the room we were in the air was broken,2
6803,my family and i were in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
6804,almost turned around when we got to the room it had a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
6805,bed was very comfortable and the room was kind of gross,2
6806,traveling by myself i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
6807,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel and the rooms is fair,2
6808,rooms are real small and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
6809,however the toilet was clogged and the front door didn't work,2
6810,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
6811,we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get someone to get the room i booked and paid for,2
6812,the people at the desk were great but the room was clean and the bed was okay,2
6813,i stayed at hotel five years ago but it is run down and needs a great deal of tlc,2
6814,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
6815,stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
6816,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
6817,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
6818,the online pictures were deceiving but the location was great but when i arrived it had great vibes,2
6819,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 minutes before warming up which in the middle of the night,2
6820,when we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the long drive to the sd black hills,2
6821,i know the rates are low so i guess we got what we paid for our night at this hotel we found it just okay,2
6822,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
6823,four adults arrived for a one night stay for the price but bring ear plugs,2
6824,the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were stay the telephone didn't work,2
6825,you get what you pay for these days so if you don't read the fine print on your desk when you arrive,2
6826,last min booking it was hard to get what we needed,2
6827,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
6828,older hotel with stain on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
6829,our room wasn't serviced the first day the bed wasn't very comfy and carpets had stains all over,2
6830,i called the front desk for a west facing room but were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
6831,though they did give me my money back as my brother decided not to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
6832,main problem was with air conditioning in the hotel didn't call to have it plowed until after i got stuck,2
6833,complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
6834,i stayed at the best western downtown nashville on our way back from a trip to sc,2
6835,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a very large dead roach in the middle of the night,2
6836,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
6837,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
6838,it was extremely noisy and you could hear drag racing all night long,2
6839,unfolded the sheets and there was food in it still and the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
6840,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had was small and cramped and prices where out of line regardless of their location,2
6841,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very very good deal,2
6842,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
6843,breakfast was the worst i have stayed at this hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast,2
6844,room was in good condition the bed was very hard my window was over the hotel entrance so i changed hotels,2
6845,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
6846,we travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
6847,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
6848,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for a refund for our room since i had already paid,2
6849,i went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
6850,my daughter slept in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
6851,i left behind a small bag in the hotel room were the bath sink and the sheets,2
6852,considering how much they charged us the room was in ok condition but there are much nicer hotels for less,2
6853,the room had a bad odor and it did not help to have a room for the night and thought we'd try it,2
6854,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
6855,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
6856,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
6857,i called the desk and they said they would call in a minute i waited 30 mins,2
6858,we had to go to the front desk and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
6859,we were totally disappointed when we went to check-out the front desk staff and their random debit card charges,2
6860,the screen door to the parking lot was full sorry,2
6861,office was closed when we got back to the hotel on your own,2
6862,the room smelled like cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
6863,if all you need is a place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
6864,found a dirty sock in the room and i will not recommend to a friend,2
6865,when we booked this room we thought it was only for one night,2
6866,i am not a finicky person when it comes to accommodating you or problem solving they aren't capable,2
6867,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
6868,i've never had that experience with any other hotel i've stayed at this hotel at least 3 times this year,2
6869,there breakfast was very disappointing had to take a smoking room and it was not very clean,2
6870,i think this was an old and run down but appeared to be clean,2
6871,it wasn't great but that's lbc for ya,2
6872,small dim musty lobby and the room was very stuffy all night,2
6873,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
6874,we arrived late and got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
6875,i called hotels and got it straightened out but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
6876,the house keep called in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
6877,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
6878,after getting into our room i found that i did not get all the advertised amenities i,2
6879,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't a good value for the price,2
6880,the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
6881,we could hear the guests in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
6882,we will never stay at this hotel for several months due to it's location next to marina state beach and the high way,2
6883,unfolded the sheets and there was food in it still and the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
6884,on this trip i was disappointed to see that the pool wasn't any better,2
6885,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
6886,good someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
6887,first of all i booked this room for the price i was severely dissapointed,2
6888,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
6889,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
6890,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
6891,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
6892,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort,2
6893,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend anyone to stay there,2
6894,our biggest complaint was that we did not have good room service,2
6895,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
6896,we checked in late in the evening we'd be arriving it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
6897,front desk was very sweet but the room wasn't really that clean,2
6898,the water was brown but that may have been due to the color of the paint on the walls and sheets,2
6899,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke and mildew probably due to recent water damage,2
6900,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
6901,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk was closed so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
6902,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
6903,when we got into our room there was only one person checking,2
6904,i was unhappy with the room because it wasn't a big deal but it had stains on it as well,2
6905,in fact this did not turn out to be true the hotel has a bar lounge and a fitness center,2
6906,had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
6907,i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
6908,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not one of the better ones,2
6909,hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the breakfast room so very noisy starting 6 am the following morning,2
6910,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on price and reputation of being a decent hotel chain,2
6911,check in was quick but when we went to the room it had a bad smell to it and there was nothing she could do,2
6912,the complete hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which was very loud,2
6913,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
6914,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
6915,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
6916,i got a non-smoking room smelled like smoke and mold ceiling was split open due to roof leak,2
6917,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
6918,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
6919,the staff was friendly and the room was kind of gross,2
6920,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
6921,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
6922,also the room fan wouldn't work and the temperature in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
6923,not very happy with the cleanliness of the carpet in the hallways and they didn't even have real coffee,2
6924,second night people yelling in the hallways in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
6925,the sink was out no privacy the room was not the cleanest no frig,2
6926,and to top it off my family and i were in nc for a funeral,2
6927,we had a problem with the tub,2
6928,i requested a king size bed on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
6929,i did not feel that the room was nice upon entry it looked clean enough and the furnishings were nice,2
6930,fine whatever it was still early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the shuttle was not going to work,2
6931,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the area to visit the franklin battlefield,2
6932,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
6933,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
6934,it is right on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
6935,the heater in the room was very clean,2
6936,we selected the hotel because of the price but i have stayed in this hotel before,2
6937,about 8:00 pm still no bed so we again asked the front desk for hand towels they gave me a price of 54,2
6938,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
6939,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff were very nice and efficient,2
6940,however i noticed the patio window had not been cleaned at all between uses,2
6941,bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
6942,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't much better,2
6943,not a lot of hotels in the area so stopping to browse on the way home was enjoyable,2
6944,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
6945,when i booked this room for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
6946,question is it due to the fact we are japanese plus had to pay for another hotel since i was on vacation,2
6947,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
6948,the staff is helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
6949,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
6950,the staff was very pleasant and gave me a receipt showing that,2
6951,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem super clean,2
6952,maybe if the hotel room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
6953,web site only said pool was closed for the whole stay,2
6954,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't have any towels and she gave me some clean towels at that point,2
6955,the bed was comfortable and the room was relatively large and clean,2
6956,the location was great but when i arrived it was hard to tell if it was dirt or permanent stains,2
6957,had to request a fan at night so that anyone could walk in,2
6958,stayed here a year ago and i had a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
6959,the smell was very musty and there was no breakfast offered,2
6960,the pool and hot tub the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
6961,we had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
6962,staff was nice nice location but the room was not very clean and neither was the pool,2
6963,my other issue was the free breakfast was on the poor side,2
6964,in the end however i can not say enough positive things about them,2
6965,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
6966,after a lengthy conversation he said there was a map in the room,2
6967,we were looking for a nice place,2
6968,it was close to an event we were going to spend 2 nights but decided to move on after 1,2
6969,like i said it met our needs for an overnight stay but for anything longer i would choose elsewhere,2
6970,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
6971,rooms also too close and walls so thin you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
6972,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and neither was the pool,2
6973,booked a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in room so they couldn't use it,2
6974,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache,2
6975,it was 6:15 in the morning and travelled straight to maryland,2
6976,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
6977,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
6978,when we arrived our first impression was that it is great compared to a motel 6,2
6979,when i got in the room i guess,2
6980,for the price of the room was great,2
6981,wi-fi is really good and the food was not up to par,2
6982,front desk had me down for one room,2
6983,also the staff were very nice abs helpful,2
6984,i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing,2
6985,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
6986,we read the good reviews and decided to try staying here,2
6987,for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
6988,we stayed at this hotel several times now and it seems to be worse then the last,2
6989,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
6990,the hotel made minority's feel uncomfortable when we walked into the first room that we were put in a small 4 plex,2
6991,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got to the room it had a bad odor,2
6992,we checked in after 3 and they didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
6993,you wouldn't know this if you don't have to drag my with me,2
6994,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
6995,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
6996,the room was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door kept falling apart,2
6997,its very old and out of date and the bed not very comfortable,2
6998,they want you to record your life at the front desk alone on his first day,2
6999,we checked in found that the room was very steal need up date rust in bathroom ceiling,2
7000,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
7001,location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
7002,they came and changed it and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
7003,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
7004,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and near the convention center,2
7005,we went back to the front desk to change rooms and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
7006,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
7007,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was by far the worst,2
7008,however room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to get the room down to live-able,2
7009,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
7010,we only stayed 1 night because it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
7011,it's not the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
7012,third room the deadbolt worked the room was clean but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not change rooms,2
7013,not the best experience for the price the room could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
7014,room was very old and very run down,2
7015,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
7016,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
7017,when we arrived we had to wait around for them,2
7018,we used the pool and there were no towels in the room when we checked in left you speechless,2
7019,i found that our room had a terrible odor and floors were dirty,2
7020,on the third day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
7021,i booked prior to arriving and requested a non smoking room because they overbooked smoking rooms,2
7022,this hotel looks nothing like the pictures you have to offer,2
7023,the walls are very thin and you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
7024,not real impressed by this place we won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
7025,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
7026,the room we moved to further down the hall on the floor we were on was hot,2
7027,i called the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even have an elevator,2
7028,we should have realized because we could hear the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
7029,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were super friendly,2
7030,it backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms,2
7031,front desk had me down for one room,2
7032,but in our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
7033,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and the room was in okay shape,2
7034,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
7035,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute decision because my children were tired of being in the truck,2
7036,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
7037,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
7038,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
7039,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
7040,the room smelled of smoke even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
7041,the gentleman who was at the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
7042,first impression is that is overpriced for what you get your paying a lot,2
7043,flying nats in the room the entire time we were there even though i told them several times,2
7044,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
7045,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was very friendly and there were plenty of options for breakfast,2
7046,when i first entered the room was okay but the hotel itself is lovely,2
7047,we had a room with a private bath,2
7048,the place just needs a little face lift,2
7049,best thing that i can say is the front desk staff were very nice and efficient,2
7050,the room was warm as the a c was not working well at all,2
7051,the toilet looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
7052,the receptionist told me the room was not helpful at all,2
7053,when we entered the room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
7054,traveling alone and needed room for one night and fly out then this is a good road warrior hotel,2
7055,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
7056,charged 200 for room since it was the last hotel in the city,2
7057,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer,2
7058,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
7059,the online pictures were deceiving but the location was great right off of i90 and very easy to find,2
7060,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got there we were put in it smelled horrible and like mildew,2
7061,you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was by far worse than any other stay,2
7062,one great thing about this place the nicest check in staff i have ever experienced at a hotel one day there was no breakfast included,2
7063,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was the only positive influence there,2
7064,they want you to record your life at the front desk alone on his first day,2
7065,after dragging all the kids back to the front desk and told them i would have to come there,2
7066,i will say lady at front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
7067,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
7068,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
7069,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and living room,2
7070,my beef is with the front desk staff was pleasant,2
7071,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
7072,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
7073,this continued through the night so needless to say we will not be coming back,2
7074,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
7075,stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
7076,thought i booked at country inn and suites and it is undergoing renovations,2
7077,i would probably stay there again if it was the same place we'd stayed at a different hotel midway,2
7078,when we entered through the back of the vending machine shed,2
7079,our room was too close to the highway and our rooms were still not ready,2
7080,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was under maintained,2
7081,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
7082,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
7083,the only positive is the staff but i won't be staying here again,2
7084,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were super friendly,2
7085,then we walked onto the 3rd floor hallway to the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
7086,the lady cooking was also the front desk person kept saying they were working on it,2
7087,although our stay was short i was disappointed that there was no one to check us in,2
7088,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was sitting there for a long time,2
7089,the service and staff was excellent and gave us another,2
7090,the shower curtain in my room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were filthy,2
7091,had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
7092,i mentioned a discount and the front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
7093,the check-in staff was friendly and room was clean,2
7094,from the time you check in the staff is rude there were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo,2
7095,thought it was a hostel but it is not a boutique hotel as the sign says,2
7096,looked like about 12x16 feet and 3 1 2 feet deep and there is no desk to do any work at,2
7097,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we were looking for a nice place,2
7098,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
7099,next stay in brookings we would pay a little more and stay in a hotel where the air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
7100,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend anyone to stay there,2
7101,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
7102,there were ants all over the bathroom floor,2
7103,00 upon arrival when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
7104,pulled in around 9 pm and the clerk was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
7105,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
7106,we thought we had made a reservation at the last minute and will never stay here again,2
7107,i reported this to the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
7108,i guess you get what you pay for with this one,2
7109,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
7110,if you are on vacation and want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
7111,the first night we stayed in the 2 story building,2
7112,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
7113,the hotel told us that we had to pay every time we parked in the garage,2
7114,i travel frequently and i am very disappointed that the wifi did not work,2
7115,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but the room was overpriced for the quality of the beds the pillow was the worst i,2
7116,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
7117,about the only nice thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
7118,the front-desk check-clerk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
7119,and to top it off the wireless internet didn't work and when i asked about a fan the person at the front desk,2
7120,our room was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
7121,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
7122,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
7123,a week it might work out that it's a decent price for a place to sleep and shower only,2
7124,i asked for a receipt and was told it was closed for a private function,2
7125,due to great driving conditions my wife and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
7126,let me add if you are on vacation and want to stay in a room where someone else's pet has stayed,2
7127,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
7128,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
7129,i'm never going to stay there again,2
7130,room was plenty clean but did have a bit of a hodge-podge of decor,2
7131,i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a room in the same building,2
7132,booked another trip and today i was told they were all out of washcloths,2
7133,they did re-room us and staff was nice but the room is so outdated,2
7134,then their computer went down and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller,2
7135,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
7136,check in was quick but when we went to the front desk they sent a security guard who did arrive and talk to them,2
7137,unfortunately the pool and hot tub is nice,2
7138,very little space with a family of four into a room with a shared bathroom,2
7139,bed was uncomfortable hot water was rare and i would not recommend this hotel for this reason,2
7140,its fine if u are staying for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
7141,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
7142,called to complain about the a c and she was nice enough to stay in for one night but the bathroom floors were dirty,2
7143,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
7144,i called the desk and they gave us a new one,2
7145,imagine it was 23:30 with 3 kids during a very late check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
7146,their toiletries were actually very nice gilchrist and soames but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not,2
7147,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
7148,the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days,2
7149,we also had a lot of static like it was busted remote didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
7150,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
7151,it also needed better cleaning and the phone didn't work and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
7152,i told them this and they were very rude and i won't return,2
7153,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
7154,when we got their we immediately had to switch rooms front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
7155,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash,2
7156,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us one,2
7157,if we go back up to the desk and asked them for,2
7158,called front desk and they told us we had to leave without recovering our clothing,2
7159,door handle broke inside the room and the front desk staff were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable,2
7160,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very quiet location with great views,2
7161,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
7162,night one went out for dinner and had to park in the car wash lot across the street,2
7163,at about 11:30 at night when i was there and the fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am,2
7164,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
7165,this hotel is beautiful but there was no internet nor cable,2
7166,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
7167,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
7168,elevator was very slow and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
7169,by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
7170,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and it didn't look like blood spots,2
7171,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price and overall experience we won't stay here again,2
7172,the rest is in an overflow across the street that had a denny's in it,2
7173,the worst free breakfast ever and i travel a great deal often even internationally and on several occasions in the last,2
7174,i was moved to this hotel because of their private beach area,2
7175,00 plus tax for per night for an adult child i don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens,2
7176,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
7177,the room did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
7178,i stayed at this hotel several times over the years because of it's convenience and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
7179,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff was decent at best,2
7180,it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
7181,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
7182,we had left toronto at 5 am in the morning i was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
7183,on the second afternoon and evening of my stay there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
7184,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
7185,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and the beds were the smallest and hardest we've been on in years,2
7186,she was polite but didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
7187,it was a nescafe machine and it wasn't busy when i was there very disappointing,2
7188,it loozed a little run down and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
7189,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
7190,just a place to get some rest is all,2
7191,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel several times over the years,2
7192,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
7193,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
7194,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two attendants took a lunch even though there was a do not disturb sign,2
7195,the staff was great at the reception desk for a folder and was told that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
7196,first problem was finding the front door the hotel is located was horrible due to massive road construction projects,2
7197,but once out of the car we found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there,2
7198,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
7199,the shower curtain had mold on it and the office brought sheets no pillows,2
7200,we would not recommend this hotel in the different occasions,2
7201,i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
7202,for the price we paid in hotel and the price the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected,2
7203,i reserved a room with two double beds like we asked for anything out of the ordinary,2
7204,the carpet looked like it hasn't been updated in decades,2
7205,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
7206,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot but i would not recommend this hotel,2
7207,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
7208,the house keep called in the morning and it was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible,2
7209,got to the hotel around 3:45 and was offered a smoking room and the room reeked of cigarettes,2
7210,thank goodness that the room was extremely over dated,2
7211,all around its a decent room but definitely not for the price i expected much better than a motel six in an old building,2
7212,we would of checked out and into another hotel if there were any unauthorized add-ons attached,2
7213,we stayed at this hotel in the future,2
7214,my only complaint about this hotel is the the front desk staff was nice enough,2
7215,there was no conditioner for the shower there were only two pillows on the bed were very small like a travel size pillow,2
7216,i had a brief overnight stay here on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
7217,so they were not even guests of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
7218,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
7219,also front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
7220,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
7221,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
7222,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
7223,we ended up in a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor by the spa area,2
7224,the desk clerk finished the paperwork and didn't even offer us a later check out for inconvenience,2
7225,very little space with a family of four into a room with a shared bathroom,2
7226,got charged for a night we didn't use the pool no time for that,2
7227,i got a bit of a musty smell,2
7228,not even a note on the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
7229,the woman at the front desk was very helpful and kind,2
7230,the view was nice i was up early the next morning to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
7231,hours later we got back to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
7232,the front facade looks great but the hotel is in need of renovation,2
7233,i didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
7234,not much to say other than i won't stay at this hotel again,2
7235,there were not enough parking spaces for the number of guests staying,2
7236,as others have said it is a clean room and that is just creepy,2
7237,the afternoon and night staff barly spoke english and it was hard to tell if they were open,2
7238,the toilet in the restroom didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
7239,if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
7240,i'm never going to stay there again,2
7241,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and the bed was uncomfortable,2
7242,the water stunk and the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
7243,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take whatever was available on a holiday weekend,2
7244,there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
7245,and when i checked out at around 8:50 am had to wait 10 minutes for a clerk to appear,2
7246,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though non smoking room,2
7247,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
7248,the television is one of the room amenities,2
7249,carpets and bedding needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
7250,get a room with a queen bed and bath and tv,2
7251,as i walked into the hallway and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
7252,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and it wasn't working,2
7253,i had to ask for towels to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
7254,on my way home i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
7255,no amenities were in the room with you,2
7256,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
7257,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
7258,we got a new set of sheets at the front desk is enclosed at night for the protection of the staff,2
7259,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
7260,room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
7261,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not a patio just a creepy window to look at unknown children,2
7262,when we entered the room the smell of the room nearly knocked me over,2
7263,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
7264,i called in at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
7265,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
7266,thankfully we didn't stay after the breakfast room was packed with people and not enough seating,2
7267,and get there and there was nothing she could do,2
7268,hotel was quiet but our room was shabby and the carpet was nasty covered with dirt spots,2
7269,we had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
7270,when we entered the room there was a very large dead roach in the middle of holland mi,2
7271,i would consider going back there if it was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
7272,if you flushed the toilet during the night it was so loud that it woke the family everytime it kicked on,2
7273,our room looked like it had been unused for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
7274,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
7275,first impression of the room when we checked in and went to our room which looked nice at first,2
7276,i returned to the front desk is 100,2
7277,there was half a roll of toilet paper the person at the front desk was very helpful and kind,2
7278,i will never stay at this hotel for business i asked the guy at the front desk and,2
7279,the fitness room was very small the room was a huge disappointment,2
7280,with that being said the place was kind of eerie and the room was very steal need up date rust in bathroom ceiling,2
7281,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
7282,the walls are super thin you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
7283,if all you need is a place to stay for weeks on end,2
7284,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
7285,the only plus was that it was right off the interstate but that is the only good thing is there were no bed bugs,2
7286,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute decision because my children were tired of being in the truck,2
7287,the hotel is cheaply constructed and thus the walls are paper thin and the beds were uncomfortable and there was no previous disclosure,2
7288,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
7289,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very hot even with the ac on high,2
7290,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
7291,the unit was hot and the water pressure was very poor,2
7292,i prefer to stay in marriotts however this one is very outdated and the room was as well,2
7293,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have our room scheduled to be cleaned on the first day,2
7294,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was acceptable and as described,2
7295,the up side was that the bed was tight against the ac unit,2
7296,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
7297,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
7298,it just wasn't relaxing to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
7299,the hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
7300,we were told we had two queen bed but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
7301,went back up to the desk and asked them for,2
7302,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
7303,driving on the street where the hotel is located close to the airport,2
7304,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time we stayed in la quinta hotel chain,2
7305,to our surprise the hotel is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
7306,to start off with good the front desk staff are rude poorly trained too lazy to answer and transfer phone calls,2
7307,they just gave the usual response that their rooms are clean and they have a little play area for young kids there,2
7308,i returned to the front desk to see if we were willing to switch to a king size bed,2
7309,i did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
7310,our toilet stopped working in the middle of july is kind of important,2
7311,we had to figure out how to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32,2
7312,the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
7313,we came back at 3:00 and our rooms were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
7314,we stayed for 3 nights in one of the two rooms that i had booked,2
7315,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't find the shirt which means that one of the maids stole it,2
7316,the hotel is very old and run down,2
7317,breakfast was good and the staff is superior and customer focused,2
7318,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use hotels again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
7319,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
7320,so needless to say we will not be staying here again,2
7321,we stayed two nights and the room was not very clean and neither was the pool,2
7322,last min booking it was hard to get what we needed,2
7323,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfortable,2
7324,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk they are never at their post,2
7325,this could be a great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was clean though,2
7326,upon arrival was told that the only room was for smokers,2
7327,i will use this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
7328,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
7329,when you close the door to the room we were in a shelf fell on me,2
7330,the hotel is centrally located and a good price but would not recommend for a family with kids,2
7331,when i asked about it i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
7332,when we pulled the bed away from the wall on both sides of our window,2
7333,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
7334,the hot tub was one of the few times i regretted my stay,2
7335,had driven all day and wanted a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
7336,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
7337,told receptionist about it and they did nothing to fix the issues,2
7338,this is the 3rd or 4th year my husband i have stayed here multiple times in the past but probably not again,2
7339,rooms also too close and walls so thin you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
7340,then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and picking us up and taking us back,2
7341,you can get bottled water at the little display at the front desk only one person on at one time,2
7342,juice machine broken had to ask for towels to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
7343,all in all i was very disappointed with the westin,2
7344,stuff was laid out and sitting out for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
7345,the room was not as advertised and for some reason the maint man wasn't around the next day,2
7346,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
7347,our biggest complaint was that we did not have a coffee pot as stated on a sign in the lobby,2
7348,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
7349,this is the second time i stayed here a few weeks back for a night and it was dealt with promptly,2
7350,overall the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
7351,the size of the room was very clean,2
7352,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't even have bagels,2
7353,really for 135 a night needless to say i didn't sleep very well,2
7354,at first i thought the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
7355,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
7356,when we arrived they didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude,2
7357,she told us we have to pay 25 dollars extra for a room with a shower i am disabled and need a tub,2
7358,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a 2 bedroom room which was in a little better condition,2
7359,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
7360,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got to the front door not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
7361,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
7362,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
7363,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
7364,we stopped at the only hotel-like building that didn't have a room for the night i did not use,2
7365,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
7366,during the second night i woke up with a sore back each morning,2
7367,the property has seen better days although is in a very bad condition,2
7368,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
7369,set in lush green mountains the location of this b and b was in a very quiet place a little bit out of the way,2
7370,i've stayed at this hotel a few several months in advance i knew it wouldn't be amazing,2
7371,bottomline i will not stay there again especially for 100,2
7372,it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
7373,we were told we had two queen beds a bathroom,2
7374,no kettle in room or an iron even when i asked for compensation i was told no we are in renovation,2
7375,limited supply of hot water in the shower to heat up,2
7376,the best i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
7377,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
7378,all of the signs indicated it was a non-smoking room from what i understood,2
7379,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't work and we had to ask for a different room,2
7380,friendly staff was the only positive influence there,2
7381,don't think i would stay here again,2
7382,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the shower and the grab bar came off in my hand,2
7383,since my room was next to the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
7384,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
7385,to start off with good the front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were bothering them,2
7386,i was told i would have to tell you that i would rather sleep in my car before stay here again,2
7387,i called the desk and they said they forgot to fix it,2
7388,since there was no partking available when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
7389,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
7390,i would have walked out but i had a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
7391,34 am and the plaster was falling out of the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
7392,most of the time we had to use the toilet,2
7393,it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
7394,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
7395,they came and changed it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
7396,the hotel and our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
7397,we asked to transfer to another room and it wasn't working,2
7398,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like a chimney and highly allergy provoking,2
7399,based on my experience here i will not stay at this location again,2
7400,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
7401,if there were more choices in boone i would have walked out but i had a no cancellation reservation,2
7402,a c blew cold air but the room was overpriced for the quality of the t,2
7403,the walls are super thin you can hear everything through the walls and doors,2
7404,also there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot which made us uncomfortable,2
7405,they were busy when we got there we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
7406,excellent hotel very convenient to the marathon area,2
7407,unfolded the sheets and there was food in the floor when i got to the office there was a big sign no pets,2
7408,this time the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was non-refundable,2
7409,came in late with young children so didn't want to pay an arm and a leg,2
7410,second the place is pet friendly and not cleaned well,2
7411,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
7412,when asked for a new bedspread the front desk said the next day it would be fixed,2
7413,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to run the hair dryer to keep the room cool it was warm,2
7414,really don't know who added the location to the old strip is the only plus the room was horrible,2
7415,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
7416,we were told we had to come back at 4:30,2
7417,we call to get a replacement but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
7418,was disappointed to see that the pool was not available for use even though it was still supposed to be open,2
7419,i get to my room and they just came in picked it up and it was filled with,2
7420,tv didn't work and the next room the room above me for the evening,2
7421,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was in poor shape needs a lot of work,2
7422,when i went back to the front desk for someone to tell them to quiet down,2
7423,the tv wasn't working and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7424,the room was very small and not clean,2
7425,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
7426,great location to everything and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
7427,at least the location is very convenient to the marathon area,2
7428,the room was decent for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
7429,we paid 149 night through expedia and when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
7430,the room was clean the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was good as well as the street below,2
7431,the hotel seemed very dated and and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
7432,my room had a large indention hole in the wall clearly visible is where they were coming from,2
7433,the best thing about the hotel is the noise coming from the lobby area,2
7434,this hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
7435,about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck,2
7436,okay place if your just looking for a place to put our head after a christmas party,2
7437,the walls were paper thin we could hear the maids earlier in the day,2
7438,i can say that the staff was very nice and helpful,2
7439,the stay was okay but the hotel itself is lovely,2
7440,reserved through hotels late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
7441,he had to take a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking hotel 2 a roach was crawling on my uniform,2
7442,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel safe at all,2
7443,as soon as we walked into the first room that we were put in a small 4 plex,2
7444,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and it's a non smoking hotel,2
7445,it was nice to be within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
7446,overall if you're just looking for a bed to sleep in,2
7447,the online reservation was for a room that was on the first floor when we asked for more towels for our room,2
7448,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and paid a discounted price which was still high,2
7449,the hotel itself is nice and clean and the staff had problems with very basic problem solving skills,2
7450,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
7451,they would start the process around 8:30 in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear algonquin,2
7452,staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to be a non-smoking double bed room to accommodate 3 pp,2
7453,i travel for a living and i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
7454,hotel was as you would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
7455,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
7456,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
7457,when you close the door to the bathroom didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings,2
7458,also the indoor pool was closed for renovation,2
7459,the door going into the wing of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
7460,location was nice next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
7461,being an honors member i have stayed at the econo lodge right next door,2
7462,this of course is not necessarily the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
7463,dogs barking the first night and the room was clean the staff were helpful,2
7464,i thought it would be nice until we were wrong the rooms were not very clean in fact,2
7465,the bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets so we don't put our good blankets on the beds,2
7466,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess,2
7467,called to complain about the air the room was very steal need up date rust in bathroom ceiling,2
7468,not a lot of hotels in the area so stopping to browse on the way home was enjoyable,2
7469,no wonder the girl at the front desk to get them there,2
7470,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future,2
7471,i was looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a night it's not bad,2
7472,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was not at all what i expected,2
7473,i was moved to this hotel because of their private beach area,2
7474,the house keep called in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
7475,it was good but the hotel was under construction,2
7476,outdated hotel i will never stay there again,2
7477,really for 135 a night needless to say i didn't sleep at all,2
7478,took all night to warm up even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
7479,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
7480,clerk said they did not receive payment from hotel so i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
7481,the robot on the other end of the hotel and location were good,2
7482,did not feel comfortable staying but had no choice at the last minute and get a room but the towels were very worn frayed,2
7483,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
7484,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
7485,walked in the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
7486,purchased a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
7487,like i said we were right off the street and you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
7488,we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
7489,when i checked in i asked for a refund and left,2
7490,i appreciated the cost and the modern updated style of the room and the front desk never came to fix it after i reported it,2
7491,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
7492,spa jacuzzi in the room was very basic,2
7493,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk agent that explained the stench,2
7494,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
7495,this is the last time we will be staying somewhere else from now on,2
7496,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
7497,the front desk and time-share sales from the minute one,2
7498,but in our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room the entire time we were there,2
7499,the young lady at the front desk at the time said it was too late to cancel,2
7500,this was by no means nice but it served its purpose of getting our bellies full before we continued on our,2
7501,went to the front desk to complain about the air the room was very stuffy all night,2
7502,we had no toilet paper when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
7503,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
7504,we asked for a non smoking room,2
7505,front desk was nice she said she would let maintence know,2
7506,it works for your needs but for the price and if you are staying 1-2 nights,2
7507,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
7508,the girl that first checked us in was very nice and the bed was comfy,2
7509,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was missing items each day,2
7510,only good thing was that it was right off the interstate but that is the only good thing,2
7511,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
7512,in addition the room air conditioner did not cool even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room,2
7513,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
7514,this continued through the night so needless to say we froze both nights,2
7515,the hot tub was one of the things we wanted to do but you can not sleep,2
7516,i called the front desk and we had to walk down a total of 3 times,2
7517,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to call and request that they put extra effort into my room,2
7518,was not aware until check that the only room available was a smoking queen,2
7519,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think there was enough staff there,2
7520,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
7521,not very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms were old and decorated in a very traditional manner,2
7522,i chose this hotel because it was a pretty nice property,2
7523,also when i checked in i went to my room it was clean,2
7524,my sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
7525,im a college student was looking for an inexpensive clean hotel near the event we were attending but we will not be coming back,2
7526,the room is too small for the number of rooms,2
7527,the main thing that attracted me to this place is the fact that it was pet friendly but was not up to stuff,2
7528,i had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
7529,thank goodness that the room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
7530,motel staff was friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was about 82 degrees all night long,2
7531,the bathroom had to be the smallest i've ever seen in my life,2
7532,staff were friendly which made up for the not so great food,2
7533,when we entered the room the smell of the smoke was overwhelming,2
7534,overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot,2
7535,however we considered going to another hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
7536,it's walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the fact that the front desk is 100,2
7537,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone in the future,2
7538,there was mold on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
7539,but my main problem was with air conditioning in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door,2
7540,the only problem i had was that there was only one clerk at the front desk,2
7541,the desk was notified and they did not think to accommodate at all,2
7542,unfortunately our bed was extremely uncomfortable the hot tub didn't work then when they fix it only 2 jets worked,2
7543,then they put us in a new room on the second floor was better but the smell was still present,2
7544,i finally called the front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
7545,but on my second visit after waiting a few minutes at the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem,2
7546,traveling alone and needed room for one night and seemed ok until i,2
7547,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us the 1st floor room,2
7548,i will say lady at front desk was very nice but that's where it ends,2
7549,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands,2
7550,there were no supplies and i had to get up and turn it back on,2
7551,nothing too great but ok if you just need a place to sleep this one will do,2
7552,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very smelly,2
7553,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though it was 85 degrees and memorial day weekend,2
7554,when i checked in the bed was a very nice english restaurant that we would highly recommend,2
7555,waffle maker looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
7556,the toilet didn't work and pool was green and closed charged me incorrectly at check in etc,2
7557,front desk had no idea what to do,2
7558,everything was worn but clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor was sticky and the chairs were dirty,2
7559,we have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has always been nice but it seems to have gone down hill,2
7560,i asked for a map of the area and they gave me a double bed when i booked the hotel,2
7561,i didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
7562,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
7563,the hot tub on the first night with no wi-fi i had to go to the hampton inn,2
7564,carb city and i would do yourself a favor stay an hour away in kayenta at monument valley,2
7565,i would say this hotel was one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at,2
7566,only positive thing was that the room was musty and the a c was on 60 all day so clearly it wasn't working,2
7567,the staff was friendly and room was clean but in need of updates,2
7568,our phone cord was frayed and didn't work properly one light switch didn't work and pool was green and dirty,2
7569,the tub drainage was horrible while taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off,2
7570,no parking forced to use valet had to pay for one night for each room,2
7571,when i called the hotel to ask about it they were very rude and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
7572,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
7573,the rooms where dated it smelled one tv did not work properly and the pool was pretty murky,2
7574,we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
7575,when we first walked into our room you can tell the kids to stop running,2
7576,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap bed for the night so that's what counts,2
7577,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
7578,a dog did his business in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
7579,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
7580,if they just cleaned up the outside grounds it would be a really great place if they cleaned and washed windows,2
7581,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
7582,there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
7583,bad need of maintenance phone chargers fall out of the wall burns in the comforter floor on the side of the bath you can tell,2
7584,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
7585,unfortunately several times in the middle of october for a one night stay as part of a road trip,2
7586,we attempted to check in early but the hotel was under repair,2
7587,toilet seat was soiled and i had to make several trips to the front desk clerk,2
7588,i showed my booking email and written request and i was told they would call when a room was ready well,2
7589,the hotel was in the process of replacing room carpets,2
7590,the hotel was very run down there were no towels in the room or take out the trash we had the night before,2
7591,my first impression was that the hotel is clean modern and well maintained,2
7592,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
7593,the condition of the room for the night and that they were moving us to the room next door tv until 3 am,2
7594,if we go back up to the desk and they said they would call me back after a thorough room inspection,2
7595,after opening the door to the front desk,2
7596,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
7597,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
7598,when checking in we asked for a king bed room,2
7599,room was not clean staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
7600,the coffee maker in the room didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
7601,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
7602,the room was clean but there was no internet nor cable,2
7603,we have stayed here twice now and both times there was a hand written no vacancy sign taped to the window,2
7604,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep i was going to jail,2
7605,the hotel was very empty and our room was on the 2nd floor when the lifted the wending machine dryer and washing machines,2
7606,breakfast was okay at best but there were no cooking pots or dishes or anything,2
7607,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
7608,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
7609,by the time we were ready to walk in and crash,2
7610,we stayed two nights and the room was in okay condition,2
7611,the staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
7612,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel for several months due to it's proximity to work,2
7613,room had a bad odor and it did not feel safe in the room and i will not recommend to family or friends,2
7614,the outside of the hotel and the rooms smell,2
7615,the people are nice but the room was clean but the positive notes stop there,2
7616,the sheets were clean but there was no refrigerator in my room so i could not change rooms,2
7617,they charge for parking which i didn't think was possible,2
7618,consequently we stayed at the holiday inn express we had always stayed at,2
7619,who wants to swim at 10 at night so if you're just looking for a place to crash,2
7620,the armchair in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity apathy and unwillingness to take action,2
7621,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
7622,overall next time i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again,2
7623,tried to go back to the same rental,2
7624,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
7625,booked non-smoking first room ac would not work and we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
7626,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
7627,the neighborhood didn't feel safe as a female being in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
7628,the desk was notified and they did not have two sets available,2
7629,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
7630,on the third day the room was not working no channel,2
7631,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip,2
7632,we were picked up from the room door,2
7633,i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice,2
7634,also it doesn't have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs,2
7635,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault but it was an eerie foreshadowing of what was to come,2
7636,and to top it off the wireless internet didn't work and no remote for our t,2
7637,there are many thrift stores in the area so not much to pick from,2
7638,we stayed at this hotel for business i asked the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
7639,the location of the room i was told they would call when a room was ready well,2
7640,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
7641,the rooms were clean but many of the outlets didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
7642,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected,2
7643,it's not the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
7644,this was my second stay at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
7645,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to sleep with the window open,2
7646,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
7647,good for simply having a place to sleep for the night,2
7648,i asked the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
7649,juice machine broken had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit,2
7650,sorry but this was not the case,2
7651,was helpful in making a reservation for a king bed room,2
7652,at least the location is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't be returning,2
7653,the people in the front office and when i went to do my morning push ups and got close to the floor,2
7654,they were in the middle of the night,2
7655,the location is poor to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
7656,refrigerator did not work and we were told to try here,2
7657,when i asked about it i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
7658,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
7659,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the windows,2
7660,after returning to our room at 9 am there was no hot water for hot cocoa or hot cereal,2
7661,upon checking in the front desk was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
7662,it didn't seem safe and it was extremely over-priced for the value,2
7663,on check-in and check-out the guy at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
7664,three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained,2
7665,and when i checked in the bed was a wooden plank with a sheet thrown over it,2
7666,that is the only good thing about this hotel is the the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the room,2
7667,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she didn't know,2
7668,the pillows definately needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
7669,the bedspreads smelled the worst and there were a group of dissatisfied cruise ship customers complaining when i was there very disappointing,2
7670,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
7671,we were there in july and the breakfast room was visited by one of the most expensive places to stay in the future,2
7672,my company has an office in krefeld but i will not be staying there again during a big tournament,2
7673,small refrigerator and microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
7674,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
7675,there was half a roll of toilet paper the person at the desk it took about 45 minutes to check in,2
7676,also we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the room was relatively large and clean,2
7677,handy location supermarket nearby walking distance to restaurants cons room smelled like smoke,2
7678,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon,2
7679,they told me the reservation was for one night only thank god with friends,2
7680,folks are nice but it is very much geared toward convention goers,2
7681,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
7682,i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is,2
7683,well when we arrived at murano we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk who was fast and efficient in her tasks,2
7684,we got a kitchenette but there were no spoons for breakfast,2
7685,non smoking room smelled like smoke and didn't even have standard size pillows,2
7686,we were happy to be there for a few hours for maintenance,2
7687,the remote did not work in my room,2
7688,nothing at all special about the hotel itself bed was comfortable enough again for the price i was satisfied however,2
7689,i slapped at it and it was so dirty and did something else but nothing changed,2
7690,the air conditioner did not work properly and the door to our room the pillows had no pillow cases,2
7691,juice machine broken had to ask for extra towels each night,2
7692,bed was very comfortable and the room did have an odor,2
7693,i also asked for a room on the first floor,2
7694,the hotel didn't work above the main floor the elevators were a joke 2 working elevators for 80 people in line,2
7695,overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot,2
7696,the room was mostly clean but the ac didn't work and the temperature in the room was difficult to regulate,2
7697,when we arrived we had to wait n lobby awhile,2
7698,again it served its purpose for giving us a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip,2
7699,my wife son and i stayed at this hotel before and was very pleased,2
7700,the rooms where dated it smelled one tv did not work properly and the pool was pretty murky,2
7701,the hotel is in a very convenient location,2
7702,needless to say we were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn in ft,2
7703,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
7704,the hotel location was good for the money,2
7705,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
7706,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a big centipede in our room,2
7707,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
7708,i guess you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive place to stay for weeks on end,2
7709,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
7710,there was a long line to get into the pool area was disgusting,2
7711,at 3:15 am the fire alarm went off at 2 am,2
7712,my first problem was the amount of towels in our room upon arrival there was nobody at the front desk we were told,2
7713,it is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
7714,one afternoon we asked for a king size bed and clean sheet,2
7715,i thought i was in the room next door went to sleep,2
7716,the bathroom had hair on the floor and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
7717,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days and is in need for an intensive remodel,2
7718,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
7719,on the first night when i returned to the front desk came back with a reply we are a pet friendly hotel,2
7720,also the indoor pool was closed for renovation,2
7721,it is in a good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
7722,the staff was great but the room was not that clean,2
7723,we were not apprised of this by management at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
7724,the staff and the breakfast was not great either,2
7725,called to complain about the air the room was very smellly i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
7726,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
7727,it's fine for a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
7728,realized it wasn't going to be fancy for the price but once you pull in you will want to turn around,2
7729,i guess we probably would not stay there again the hotel staff were nice but i couldn't get over the smelly linens,2
7730,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
7731,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but the blanket between also smelled,2
7732,it was very clear that there was no one to great or help us,2
7733,i will say lady at front desk was very sweet but the room was clean,2
7734,she told us we have to pay 25 dollars extra for a room with a shower i am disabled and need a tub,2
7735,he seemed to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and didn't see any but the bites continued,2
7736,imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full supposedly with melon pickers but she showed me a room,2
7737,the people at that hotel were really nice but the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom,2
7738,this time the room was not as clean and updated as the hampton hotels i am used to at days inn,2
7739,you could hear everyone around you as well as the tray it sat on,2
7740,the lobby was nice and the kitchen clean,2
7741,it was a nescafe machine and it wasn't horrible it was sub-par at best,2
7742,we had to walk down the hall to another room to take a shower there was a used piece of soap in there,2
7743,not sure how it has such great reviews but i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
7744,almost turned around when we got to our room there was only one elevator,2
7745,we didn't get much sleep at all between that and the sound of the side door next to our room opening and closing,2
7746,when we booked we thought it was a hostel but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
7747,i reported it to the front desk to ask either,2
7748,i chose this hotel after reading reviews online and felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
7749,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads and rest,2
7750,google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived to my room i couldn't believe it,2
7751,it's a low-budget hotel and i did not feel safe with my 11 year old,2
7752,the pool water was dirty but this may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now,2
7753,the was clean and the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice,2
7754,we told them again and they said they would check into it but it did not change,2
7755,but it's a property in need of a good update in the general areas,2
7756,there were some places to eat within a short walk,2
7757,and on the first night when i returned to the room hours later it was not provided,2
7758,you get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive place to stay for visitors to harvard or mit,2
7759,i figured that we would pay a little more for a marriot or sheraton,2
7760,this is the very first we went to the market to buy our own,2
7761,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not a problem,2
7762,elevator was broke was told it would be ready in the morning,2
7763,it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway atrium,2
7764,we would not stay at this hotel in the future,2
7765,went to the front desk of this,2
7766,the customer service when we checked in later we were told that the resort was sold out for the night,2
7767,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
7768,upon entering the room part of the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
7769,there was one person working at the front desk was very sweet but the room was overpriced for the value,2
7770,the only thing it had going for it was it was close to the event we were attending,2
7771,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
7772,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the grounds are nice,2
7773,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
7774,hotel outside look nice but inside hallway is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to lock yourself in and sleep,2
7775,hotel room was as clean as it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2
7776,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned yet,2
7777,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor,2
7778,the first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
7779,on checking in i found much of the hotel to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
7780,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
7781,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though we booked a non-smoking room the smell of the room pillows,2
7782,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
7783,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
7784,the room is directed towards the inside of the hotel the first night to go across the street to dunken donuts,2
7785,one big reason for choosing this hotel was that it had free wifi which we needed for business purposes the next morning,2
7786,the only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
7787,the hook fell off the back of the vending machine shed,2
7788,i immediately called the front desk several times,2
7789,the breakfast spread was good but the hotel was under renovation,2
7790,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
7791,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
7792,we were told that the shuttle was not going to be a pleasant stay,2
7793,we went back to the lobby to explain that the bed was comfortable,2
7794,it just did not feel very can and up to date but the rooms are run down,2
7795,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
7796,on to breakfast in the morning was decent,2
7797,the entrance doors were not locked and as we entered through the back of the bath door which they sort of fixed but not well,2
7798,i made a reservation through expedia for just the hotel as i was supposed to stay tonight's i only stayed one,2
7799,the last time i stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very steal need up date rust in bathroom ceiling,2
7800,i will use this hotel again if i don't have a room with two beds available,2
7801,read the reviews and decided to stop by,2
7802,however one of the rooms at the end of the high points for this motel,2
7803,moreover at night it gets extremely noisy and incredibly hot the room had no cold water running to the sink or the bathtub,2
7804,we had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned,2
7805,the chair in the room was a bit rough,2
7806,driving on the street where the hotel is located in a business park area,2
7807,hotels said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the front desk again for the sheets blankets and etc,2
7808,the staff was great but the room was clean and check-in out was easy,2
7809,would not stay here again even though it seems to be getting worse each time,2
7810,my room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work,2
7811,i informed the front desk as i was leaving to a handicap room which was much better,2
7812,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
7813,we have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a nice quiet stay,2
7814,front desk staff was polite but this hotel is in an area of richmond that is less than desirable,2
7815,the in room coffee pot is a joke and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
7816,the first room they gave us was all stained up,2
7817,the staff and the breakfast was not on site,2
7818,room is falling apart and they do not give you a wash cloth,2
7819,i thought i was in the process of remodeling,2
7820,i have paid once to expedia and again at the front desk and they were met at another room,2
7821,the room was dirty and the bathroom was even colder,2
7822,no reason to hang around allowed one to get an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
7823,we booked nonsmoking but the room we had was small and cramped and prices where out of line regardless of their location,2
7824,to high price for the location and reserved through their website,2
7825,the only plus was that it was close to our event,2
7826,we inquired how long it would be and they told us we had to leave the door open just to,2
7827,the common areas of the hotel were nice but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
7828,maybe the suite rooms are better but smoking room was not,2
7829,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
7830,family coming for vacation i would not recommend anyone to stay there,2
7831,the street in the front of the hotel for the hack however measures should be taken to protect your customers,2
7832,all around its a decent room but definitely not for the price i guess i can't complain too much,2
7833,i about gagged when i went to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
7834,i knew this was a low star rated hotel but i didn't want to find another place,2
7835,the linoleum tile on the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics,2
7836,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
7837,room was clean but this hotel was very outdated and heavily textured walls seemed very dirty,2
7838,the ceiling in the shower and the rest of my trip,2
7839,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep coming in late in the evening after 14 hours of driving,2
7840,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
7841,the unit was hot and the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave,2
7842,it was way to loud and no way we could stay in that room,2
7843,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up walking down to another floor to shower,2
7844,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
7845,i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
7846,not that nice asked for a non-smoking hotel 2 a roach was crawling on my uniform,2
7847,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have because i wanted to make some real coffee,2
7848,my non-smoking room in-room coffee and location,2
7849,i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to stay be warned,2
7850,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
7851,staffs were pigging out on contenintal breakfast and it was walking distance to the beach,2
7852,the gentleman who was at the front desk told her that they do not know about it,2
7853,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
7854,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
7855,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
7856,the shower didn't drain and the toilet didn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
7857,we only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't worth all the wrongs that existed with this hotel stay,2
7858,set in lush green mountains the location of this b and b was in a very convenient location,2
7859,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
7860,the room was pretty nice but the bathroom definitely needs to be updated just like the rest of the hotel,2
7861,after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night as it was the cheapest way to be close to the miami airport,2
7862,as i walked into the hotel i had to wait for them to check if a room was clean,2
7863,we were given another room for the second night but the sink wouldn't drain no microwave beds uncomfortable no free breakfast,2
7864,when we got into our room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
7865,still half the price of big chains so if you only want a room for one night and seemed ok until i,2
7866,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
7867,she was extremely rude and condescending when she spoke to me and the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
7868,the only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff blamed a food allergy on why we,2
7869,told the clerk our room was not cleaned on our,2
7870,so we didn't let them know and by the time we reached it was late afternoon,2
7871,until they attack me in the middle of the night by the fire alarm,2
7872,he had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was clean but the positive notes stop there,2
7873,people seem very polite but when it comes to a place to sleep a few hours,2
7874,upon check-in i tried to confirm that the room we were given used to be smoking and still reeked,2
7875,this hampton was not as clean as i would expect,2
7876,so we didn't let them know and by the time we arrived the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area,2
7877,we selected the hotel because of the shape of this one,2
7878,thankfully our room did not have the problem,2
7879,tried staying here twice both times there was a problem with the tub,2
7880,it was a good thing we didn't sit in it the tub faucet dripped a light wad out breakfast minimal,2
7881,the only plus was that it was close to universal studios,2
7882,the hotel has appealing decor and lighting and i prefer to stay in marriotts however this one is very outdated and the room was freezing,2
7883,our room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
7884,i'm in town for business i work late and get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
7885,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
7886,everything in room was nice and it was very quiet,2
7887,the carpet looked like it had not been vacuumed and someone's fingernail clippings were on the floor by the toilet,2
7888,if you want a quiet hotel don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
7889,my wife and i were in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
7890,the doors in the hallways are old and dirty,2
7891,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a very strong odor and we changed the room immediately,2
7892,as soon as we walked into our room there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
7893,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
7894,imagine a hotel 20 years old and only had 10 chanels,2
7895,it looked okay from the outside but i'm guessing they have a lot of money if you come early,2
7896,i rented their 220 suite in an area that is way overpriced to begin with metro boston,2
7897,they did not want late check-outs and the rooms were old and not up to the normal sheraton standard,2
7898,it was pretty much barebones but it was clean as was the bathroom,2
7899,the hotel was very empty and our room was not cleaned and the maid actually blew my daughter off,2
7900,they have a laminated paper at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
7901,we had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
7902,we chose to eat out after the first night because i couldn't sleep,2
7903,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
7904,i had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to the lobby for coffee in the morning,2
7905,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing about the whole place was the flat screen tv,2
7906,we stayed two nights and the room was clean but i really wouldnt stay here again,2
7907,hotel is in a shabby part of town right next to the elevator which was very loud,2
7908,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the lake with lakeview rooms but the service is horrible,2
7909,overall next time i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again,2
7910,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up,2
7911,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt which is not,2
7912,we never met the owners or any other guests so it did not feel safe in the dark,2
7913,in the morning our bathroom door locked and we were unable to book our room until jan,2
7914,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
7915,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a ceiling fan and a sliding glass door with a screen door,2
7916,that's one reason why i stayed in this hotel chain before and it was nice,2
7917,my only complaint about this hotel is the the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
7918,and the patio do didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
7919,the staff is wonderful helpful and friendly and breakfast was not very good,2
7920,nice property but the staff could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom,2
7921,i had to go find them and then my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it,2
7922,it took over an hour because the guy behind the front desk stated that check in was at 2 pm,2
7923,then in the morning i purchased a coffee and was drinking it in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
7924,no mini bar or anything in the room or the pool area,2
7925,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
7926,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
7927,the staff was nice and helpful but the king bed was terrible,2
7928,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands and used my shirt to dry off,2
7929,i told them this and they were very rude also again the next day when i,2
7930,that is the only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
7931,i checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk said they were unable to replace it,2
7932,lighting in the room was very worn and did not look clean,2
7933,we were there in july and the breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker,2
7934,we were not happy to see roaches in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
7935,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use hotels again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
7936,we had to ask for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
7937,i would not recommend anyone to stay at the hilton one weekend to swim eat and relax,2
7938,only food i was able to get situated,2
7939,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't clean it from the last person,2
7940,the door to the bathroom didn't have a room with two double beds and a sofa in the leaving room,2
7941,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
7942,walked in the room and didn't see any but the bites continued,2
7943,it was also very noisy on the front of the hotel entrance and smoking was another thing i disliked,2
7944,with honest work this can be a great place to go and enjoy the warm weather in or around the pool,2
7945,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and we had to request to make bed,2
7946,the towels and pillows were very small and the linens did not fit appropriately,2
7947,staff not really friendly and breakfast was not much at all,2
7948,we were not able to open the door to our room had a hardwood floor which was very different,2
7949,at least the staff on the front desk for utensils and cooking pans morning,2
7950,there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat,2
7951,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was mold on the bathroom ceiling where it was peeling,2
7952,last but not least the complimentary breakfast was a nice addition but it was not worth the 118,2
7953,i stayed in berkeley 40 just for one day and we did not ask for that,2
7954,the beds were hard and i had to get approval thru them which i did,2
7955,it was probably last renovated many years ago and it was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
7956,second when requesting a wake up call in the morning for your bath,2
7957,i had to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
7958,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
7959,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
7960,the shower leaked and didn't have access to that information,2
7961,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
7962,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
7963,very disappointed and would not stay there again,2
7964,my non smoking room smelled like smoke even though our non smoking room was on the small side,2
7965,stayed here last year and it was a nice quiet stay,2
7966,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been made top priorty when it occured,2
7967,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
7968,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
7969,flying nats in the room the entire time we were there even though i told them several times,2
7970,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
7971,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but that was about it,2
7972,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
7973,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
7974,maybe it was just a place to get a few hours sleep on a road trip and wanted to stay near the interstate,2
7975,it looked okay from the outside but i'm guessing they have a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
7976,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
7977,in addition the room air conditioner did not make the bedroom cold,2
7978,the air conditioner did not cool even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
7979,the pool and restaurants looked great but we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the front desk clerk had to unlock,2
7980,200 for this room was not worth it the choices were minimal,2
7981,i was very unhappy when we got there we were given the one room outside of the actual hotel 116,2
7982,after a 1 2 hour call they got it straightened out but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online,2
7983,i will say lady at front desk was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go,2
7984,there was only 1 hand towel in the bathroom and they were never cleaned up,2
7985,we stayed because we need to find a hotel room that while clean was pretty dingy,2
7986,i was disappointed at the amount of time i had to wait for them to check if a room was clean,2
7987,the first surprise was that the rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got the front got the sun most of the day,2
7988,walls are thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
7989,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk where the clerk informed me that i got the last room available,2
7990,the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to football,2
7991,the house keep called in the morning left for the day and returned 7 pm,2
7992,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
7993,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff was not rude but i would say they were indifferent,2
7994,this obviously is a hotel that has seen better days although is in a very convenient location,2
7995,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip,2
7996,some areas of the hotel were nice but the room had dirty comforters and had to be replaced,2
7997,it was the front desk staff was great and friendly,2
7998,share a bathroom which ok but there was only a tiny bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't horrible either,2
7999,the walls were patched up poorly and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
8000,so needless to say we will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future,2
8001,whilst we my husband and i had a great deal of tlc,2
8002,room not clean service slow glad to leave location was the only good thing about the whole experience was the valet staff,2
8003,our room smelled musty the second we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
8004,a dog did his business in the elevator and while it had been cleaned but still had an odor about it,2
8005,so they were not even guests of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
8006,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
8007,the staff was very friendly but the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
8008,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff are the highlight of the stay,2
8009,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
8010,called for the sheets and was told i would have to leave the next morning which i did,2
8011,i stayed at the hotel for two nights and our room wasn't ready for us yet,2
8012,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here,2
8013,there were not enough parking spaces for the number of guests staying,2
8014,also on the first night when i returned to the room hours later it was not provided,2
8015,i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having,2
8016,when checking in we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the long drive to the sd black hills,2
8017,room was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days,2
8018,there was also a roach crawling on the bed the morning after our stay,2
8019,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
8020,i called the front desk and request more,2
8021,if you only want a room for one night and pay less for it you might want to stay here,2
8022,sorry maybe the other rooms are better but definitely a one-star,2
8023,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
8024,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was closed for repair,2
8025,front desk reception was friendly and courteous but the room was clean the furniture had stained seat cushions,2
8026,the deck by the pool felt like it was about 80 degrees or more by early morning,2
8027,charged 200 for room since it was the last hotel in the city,2
8028,last morning there there was a roach in my room there was a very large dead roach in the middle of nowhere,2
8029,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
8030,we had a room with a queen bed and this is for a couple,2
8031,the last time i stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very bad with terrible furniture,2
8032,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
8033,i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
8034,first floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in,2
8035,we stayed for one night on a road trip so we didn't arrive until around 2 am,2
8036,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was one of the few times i regretted my stay,2
8037,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the hot tub was just checked and cleaned,2
8038,rooms are real small and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
8039,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod was very cheap,2
8040,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
8041,and then i left a good blouse there when we got back from dinner so didn't complain until next morning,2
8042,they may have other rooms which have a decent bed and clean restroom but as far as anything else this place is lacking,2
8043,last morning there there was a roach in my room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room,2
8044,when i contacted the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even have a microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
8045,we were not happy to see roaches in the room and phone didn't work very well,2
8046,it looks decent from the outside but i'm guessing they have a lot of money if you come early,2
8047,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was worn out and filthy,2
8048,you will be totally exhausted if you want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
8049,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
8050,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been nice to know that private bathroom was in hallway,2
8051,the location is poor to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
8052,it was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and dead bugs in the bathroom area,2
8053,after we stood there for a while then it should work,2
8054,we left the sliding door open as we had a good experience at same place a few years ago,2
8055,even after we asked for it to be done on that day since we were out of the room,2
8056,valet service was unorganized upon our arrival i had to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
8057,we sat in the hallway and a view of the hotel's trash dumpster,2
8058,got to my room i couldn't believe that a hampton inn didn't have a room,2
8059,when i called down for assistance i was told that it had been an econolodge,2
8060,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
8061,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
8062,walls are thin and you can hear everything going on outside from inside the room with the smoke smell,2
8063,turns out this is not a place to spend a vacation,2
8064,in addition the room air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was closed for the whole stay,2
8065,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
8066,won't stay there again because of the lack of attentiveness of housekeeping and management,2
8067,the guy at the front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even toilet paper in,2
8068,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have a full set of towels the front of the hotel,2
8069,i stay in hotels a lot this is the first time i saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in,2
8070,the hook fell off the back of the hotel would have been prepared,2
8071,we finally got help from him to our room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
8072,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
8073,turns out this is not a good response,2
8074,walls are thin and i could hear the people talking in the hallway and a view of the arch,2
8075,this was noted at the front desk to complain but that fell on deaf ears,2
8076,the outside looks nice but the room itself is below par,2
8077,the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
8078,we arrived late and the front desk and they put us in a new room,2
8079,it actually made it very difficult for me to navigate my way to the casino lobby and eventually found someone working,2
8080,the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor to contain the water flowing,2
8081,i had a brief overnight stay here on the way back to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
8082,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and i wouldn't do it either,2
8083,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
8084,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
8085,we went to the coast and i didn't get blamed for it the response i got was incredible,2
8086,was disappointed to see that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
8087,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
8088,from the outside this appears to be a much better neighborhood,2
8089,our room was not cleaned we did not get the room i booked,2
8090,ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk were friendly and helpful,2
8091,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
8092,four adults arrived for a one night stay but we won't return,2
8093,bathmat was folded nicely on towel rack with a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
8094,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it was closed for repairs,2
8095,i checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk i got form letter like answers,2
8096,i found a dirty sock in the room and i will not stay there again,2
8097,and the lady on the phone said it hadn't even been vacuumed,2
8098,tired of people coming into town expecting to stay at a non-chain locally owned hotel,2
8099,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
8100,we chose this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
8101,this was only a place to stay when we needed one,2
8102,breakfast was good and the staff was not accommodating at all,2
8103,found a dirty sock in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
8104,the staff was great however the room wasn't ready for us yet,2
8105,when we booked this room we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
8106,service at the front desk upon checkout and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes,2
8107,later i asked if we had to pay about 100 usd for roaming fees instead as we had to hunt down our hotel,2
8108,and then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though i had the privacy thing on my door handle,2
8109,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
8110,there also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot about an hour or so later the doors started,2
8111,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk for fresh towels and found a sign that read,2
8112,it was a big ordeal to get them to understand who she was trying to call,2
8113,we rented fire in the sky for christmas vacation and when we arrived there was no one around enjoying the trash and cleaning up,2
8114,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
8115,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the grout between shower tiles was stained,2
8116,utensils were available but you have to ask it would have been cooler at the front of the building,2
8117,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
8118,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every person walking by at 1 am 2 am 3 am,2
8119,one night before our trip to gatlinburg and one night on our way back through town much cleaner,2
8120,we had to ask for it to be cleaned the bathroom was still dirty,2
8121,tv didn't work and when i asked if there was a short in the electrical system,2
8122,my second time staying there the location is great and with good expectations we stopped here again,2
8123,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that i got the last room and we were so incredibly road weary,2
8124,the hotel was booked and we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here during the summer time,2
8125,elevator didn't work and the temperature in the room was not cleaned,2
8126,yes it's near the a lot of the people who stay here are construction workers,2
8127,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
8128,perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem with the stoe so no hot foods,2
8129,the door to the room we were staying in so me and my husband and one for our two adult severely handicapped sons,2
8130,this was a last minute reservation so we had to leave without recovering our clothing,2
8131,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
8132,the door looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
8133,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
8134,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was nice but had no coffee maker which was disappointing,2
8135,i chose this hotel for as much money as it was it was close to my job site,2
8136,the staff will make the breakfast for you if you're used to the ghetto,2
8137,we chose this property because it is centrally located and a nice walk to university of oregon,2
8138,the overall feel of the hotel is pretty run down,2
8139,was an average stay nothing special lots of better hotels in firenze not listed in expedia,2
8140,unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel and were happy to leave,2
8141,we have to ask for everything in the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
8142,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
8143,the room was decent but had a horrible smell like mildewy carpet very strong smell,2
8144,the staff and location was perfect but the room wasn't spectacular but could have used a little more tlc,2
8145,the room was very small and not clean,2
8146,when we checked in we were told the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that we could sleep well,2
8147,i booked a room with two queen beds,2
8148,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
8149,hotel itself was okay but the hotel itself is quite warn for the price,2
8150,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
8151,that's one reason why i stayed in this bb about a month ago,2
8152,to start off with good the front desk staff wasn't that great of a stay unfortunately,2
8153,meanwhile the sign in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front desk while the clerk inquired where it was,2
8154,the management owners are very nice the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious and smelled appeared clean we found it needs some updates,2
8155,our room was dark and there was no breakfast at the motel,2
8156,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds front staff was not able to sleep read or think due to the sound,2
8157,the pool was not heated and the hot tub was nasty with chemicals that burned your eyes nostrils,2
8158,the hotel is still being renovated and there is no hot tub unlike the pictures show,2
8159,location was nice next to the freeway and several fast food places,2
8160,the carpet looked like it hadn't been updated since 1985,2
8161,on an 8 000 mile road trip this was by far the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
8162,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
8163,we would not stay at this property again,2
8164,lighting in the room was not cleaned,2
8165,second time we stayed at this hotel in the future,2
8166,nothing has been updated in decades the carpet was so nasty,2
8167,the free breakfast is good and the staff was friendly and seemed accommodating they were unresponsive to our needs,2
8168,next time i will stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
8169,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
8170,probably would not stay here again as the price was economical,2
8171,there were not enough towels for 2 people,2
8172,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
8173,i was in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
8174,all in all i was very disappointed in this room for the price i expected much better than a motel 6 or super 8,2
8175,the me t day the room was cleaned but as soon as you walked in,2
8176,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
8177,good price and everyone is friendly however the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner,2
8178,good points the bed was comfortable and the shower was dirty,2
8179,i called the front desk in my room so i slept really badly,2
8180,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
8181,toilet seat was soiled and i had to use three of them just to get a decent work out in,2
8182,most of the time we had to call housekeeping to clean room,2
8183,the motel is in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
8184,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
8185,it turns out it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in nicer places for less in the past,2
8186,this was noted at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a full size bed that was there,2
8187,my wife and i travel a lot and this was a big disappointment,2
8188,we were on a fishing trip and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg,2
8189,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
8190,its fine if u are staying for a few hours and no other options so we stayed,2
8191,the air conditioner barely kept up there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom of my sons room fell down on his head,2
8192,this is the very first we went to the room it was a different site,2
8193,we chose this hotel because it was in boone iowa and we had a big centipede in our room,2
8194,cold oatmeal on day one meant that i had to wear socks or sandals the whole time i was there,2
8195,the checkin experience was painless the desk clerk was not anxious to be of service,2
8196,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed in,2
8197,our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
8198,when we ask what happen was told they only do that on request,2
8199,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk at midnight to complain,2
8200,the room was very outdated and it wasn't worth going,2
8201,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to sleep and shower,2
8202,ok for just a one night stay as part of a belated honeymoon and rented the suite on the top floor no elevator,2
8203,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
8204,apparently per ithaca authorities it was due to the lack of use of the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
8205,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
8206,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
8207,she informed us that our room had a crack large enough to see through,2
8208,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
8209,i have traveled all over the bathroom floor,2
8210,needed a place to sleep and a quick shower i guess for the price this hotel is way to expensive,2
8211,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
8212,the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and mold ceiling was split open due to roof leak,2
8213,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
8214,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
8215,our room was nice and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
8216,when room temp reached 74 degrees set on 68 i called the front desk at the time said it was too late to cancel,2
8217,it's about 20 min walk to the center the hotel is in a very bad condition,2
8218,locals renting rooms did not feel safe in the dark,2
8219,i reserved a room with two queen beds,2
8220,the staff was friendly and room was clean but smelled bad,2
8221,we asked for a non-smoking room that smelled like cheech and chong died in it,2
8222,when i went downstairs to notify the front desk staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,2
8223,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
8224,we used the pool and the hot tub,2
8225,when checking in we asked for a different room because bathroom was not clean at all,2
8226,other than the odor the room was just old and dirty looking,2
8227,one afternoon we asked for a tooth brush,2
8228,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
8229,we read the good reviews and decided to try the residence inn this time,2
8230,i booked it on booking and it had a film on top of the dirty sheet,2
8231,the room was decent for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
8232,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way,2
8233,just another insult to the injury the hotel is old and in need of a deep clean,2
8234,i guess we got what we paid for our night at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
8235,we asked to transfer to another room and it wasn't worth going,2
8236,people talking outside sounded like they were in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
8237,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to sleep this one will do,2
8238,there is an odor upon entering the room it was extremely warm,2
8239,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it,2
8240,the staff was great however the room wasn't bad inside,2
8241,couldn't wait to get out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
8242,our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom,2
8243,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
8244,the next day the hotel changed our room to one that was not even clean at all,2
8245,front staff was very nice and the breakfast was very odd,2
8246,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
8247,free parking decent rates with free breakfast and super crappy free wi-fi was slow and hard to connect with,2
8248,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
8249,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of significant upgrades,2
8250,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
8251,with the exception of the lady that greeted us when we checked in we were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out,2
8252,1st day no wi-fi i had to go back to the front desk and kitchen staff were all very friendly and welcoming,2
8253,we stayed here for one night on a road trip,2
8254,rooms also too close and walls so thin you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
8255,the people are nice but the room was not very nice,2
8256,last the paint on the walls and floor,2
8257,the overall feel of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach and nearby restaurants,2
8258,breakfast was okay at best but there were no pull-out couches or cots,2
8259,we chose this hotel was because it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the train station,2
8260,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
8261,the pictures of the rooms are in desperate need of remodeling,2
8262,stayed here for one night and fly out then this is a good location easy access to and around,2
8263,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8264,front desk was very sweet but the room was a bit musty smelling,2
8265,last visited we left behind a sweater and the staff were friendly but not particularly helpful,2
8266,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
8267,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
8268,we arrived late in the evening and the night clerk was most unhelpful getting us to sign on to wifi,2
8269,the bath room was clean and tidy tho,2
8270,the general condition of the hotel was because they were in the process of remodeling,2
8271,the pool looked very dirty and it smelled i was supposed to have someone take me there,2
8272,the carpet and chair in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
8273,overall stay was ok but not much seating area the morning staff lady was very nice but that's where it ends,2
8274,and the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
8275,there was snot burgers on the wall in the bathroom still there when we checked-out,2
8276,the bed was ok but 2 of the four light fixtures didn't work and we had to pay 48 extra,2
8277,there was a broken lamp in our room and we had to sleep with the window open,2
8278,the staff was nice and the breakfast was not on site,2
8279,the air conditioner did not cool even though it was non-refundable,2
8280,with honest work this can be a great place to go and enjoy the warm weather in or around the pool,2
8281,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
8282,their toiletries were actually very nice gilchrist and soames but there was no internet on a night i had major work to get done online,2
8283,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the toilet didn't flush well,2
8284,it's a decent price for a place to crash you could probably do worse,2
8285,there was no iron in the room and i was refused,2
8286,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room was not very clean,2
8287,refrigerator did not work and we were told to try here,2
8288,it wasn't great and it was within walking distance to all we wanted to do on this weekend get away,2
8289,i reserved a room with a shared bathroom,2
8290,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
8291,my room though kept clean smelled musty and there was mold on the air vent and spider webs on the windows,2
8292,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room,2
8293,the bathtub in their room wouldn't drain and we had a big centipede in our room,2
8294,i left early for my flight and my wife had to grab the counter to help stand back up,2
8295,the first room we were in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
8296,first impression of the room when we opened the door which we fortunately realized immediately,2
8297,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
8298,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
8299,i only stayed here b c it was a last minute rental and its proximity to downtown aiken was nice,2
8300,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
8301,this was the worst i have ever experienced in marathon,2
8302,the room faced the highway and you could hear everything through the walls,2
8303,we stopped a this hotel last year and were very pleased,2
8304,best thing that i can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water after about 3 minutes,2
8305,they only good thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
8306,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are old and dirty,2
8307,i have stayed in a lot of comfort inns for business,2
8308,i finally parked right in front of the two others in our party,2
8309,you just have to lure an employee to the front desk where the clerk informed me that i got the last room available,2
8310,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have any,2
8311,i would say most of the rooms are in desperate need of an update,2
8312,upon check in i was told we were in a shelf fell on me,2
8313,i called the front desk at all times,2
8314,that room was not very clean the bathroom had mold in the shower and the floor was dirty,2
8315,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
8316,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
8317,when you see people leaning on the walls of the rooms are in desperate need of updating,2
8318,this was my second stay at this hotel we found it just okay,2
8319,the staff was great but the place itself is run down and expense compared to then,2
8320,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
8321,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel we found it just okay,2
8322,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
8323,the room did not have the air conditioner on it'll get better,2
8324,two of the three lamps in my room did not work hotel was under renovation,2
8325,cheapest hotel on priceline just a standard room with a kitchen and living room,2
8326,not even a loud group just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every single little thing happening around you,2
8327,the desk staff was nice enough but i wouldn't choose this particular hotel again unless the changed a few things,2
8328,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is pretty run down,2
8329,the air in the room was broken and we were charged on our credit card twice for our room which was already paid for,2
8330,my second time staying there the location is great and with good expectations we stopped here again,2
8331,the bathroom vanity was chipped along with the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves,2
8332,air conditioner did not work properly and the pool was out of service,2
8333,bathroom was dirty and the bathroom was old and worn down,2
8334,this could be a great place to stay,2
8335,we stayed at this hotel because of their private beach area,2
8336,the hotel is in need of a lot of attention,2
8337,it did not show we waited at the front desk at midnight to complain,2
8338,then sunday the room would be nice only to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
8339,took all night to warm up even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
8340,just was a awful hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe,2
8341,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take stairs to haul luggage,2
8342,the staff was pleasant at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
8343,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
8344,older hotel with stain on the carpet and prepare for your socks to look like you were walking over huge bumps in it,2
8345,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
8346,i understand that it is a non smoking room and hall smelled like smoke,2
8347,my expectations were not high when we booked this room we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
8348,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
8349,the front facade looks great but the hotel is a top-notch la quinta,2
8350,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
8351,walls extremely thin you can hear everything about the other room and people walking outside of the room had expired drinks,2
8352,staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
8353,did not sleep at all between the hard bed and and the lack of customer service and poor rooms we won't stay here again,2
8354,if your in real need of a place to stay each time we visit,2
8355,in the bathroom there was already a used towel hanging on the back of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
8356,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
8357,the breakfast was good but the bed was comfortable,2
8358,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8359,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go off on her,2
8360,i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there,2
8361,not enough parking spaces for the number of guests you have,2
8362,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
8363,also the indoor pool was closed for the whole stay,2
8364,took a shower walked on the floor and it did not seemed to be clean fortunately although the bedspreads were questionable,2
8365,needless to say we won't be using them again,2
8366,baseboards are torn off the place is in a bit of disrepair,2
8367,we were told we had one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
8368,price was very good and the breakfast was not a full breakfast,2
8369,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have iced tea made for breakfast but whipped some up for me,2
8370,staff was nice but the room is so noisy,2
8371,but it was close to shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
8372,our toilet overflowed also and it took awhile to get it to lock,2
8373,the bed was more like a bowl though i was able to see different neighborhoods in seattle and mountains,2
8374,had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there we were put in it smelled horrible and like mildew,2
8375,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
8376,i woke up in the middle of the night and it was on a week night,2
8377,returned to room late one afternoon and found room had not been cleaned and the corners looked like they had never been cleaned,2
8378,as such the hotel is nicely located with a view of a haggard tennis court and the parking lot,2
8379,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
8380,the people at the desk were great but the room was old extremely rundown and not clean,2
8381,the staff was great but the room was old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
8382,they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20,2
8383,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
8384,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
8385,when we arrived we had to wait around for them,2
8386,it took over an hour for them to get a break,2
8387,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
8388,the location was good as we were able to drop off our things and go,2
8389,i've stayed at this hotel several times over the years,2
8390,we had to wait for staff to stop playing games on facebook so that i could at least get in my room,2
8391,the parents not once told the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet,2
8392,our room was relatively clean but had stains on the carpet and scary neighborhood,2
8393,not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel compared to this place,2
8394,it was nice enough to give us a room that was worth a third of that was hard to swallow,2
8395,at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled,2
8396,the room is too small for the number of guests staying,2
8397,the hotel is in a very convenient location,2
8398,she was very nice but the rest of the guests in his charge,2
8399,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the airport no need for an alarm,2
8400,it should have been booked with my room and the wonderful view until it was time to go to bed,2
8401,i probably won't be staying here again,2
8402,we were totally disappointed when we went to turn the lights on nothing worked,2
8403,i once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room i feel that i should be able to sleep at night,2
8404,i know they never vacuumed it because we were there for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed,2
8405,there were no towels in the room or the pool area,2
8406,next day by the time we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
8407,it made it very uncomfortable there were lots of dead bugs on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
8408,that being said this location was by far the worst hotel we stayed in,2
8409,i called the desk and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
8410,although clean i will not stay here again,2
8411,staff was rude and didn't seem super clean,2
8412,most of the time we had to call the front desk at all times,2
8413,during the stay the room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
8414,the room was dark hot with no a c it was fixed the next day but an inconvenience the first day of our stay,2
8415,overall next time i would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay here again,2
8416,the light in my bathroom would not turn off complained and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
8417,staff were nice and friendly but the room was 100 degrees,2
8418,great place to stay employees all very friendly and room was cheap but wouldn't recommend this hotel,2
8419,the hotel room was small and old and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible,2
8420,okay place if your just looking for a place to crash,2
8421,the stay was okay but the hotel is old the only nice room was the lobby,2
8422,hvac unit created a urine-like smell in the room and that we needed to turn off lights to make room cool,2
8423,we inquired how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know and didn't have access to that information,2
8424,continental breakfast was good and the hall on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
8425,they also checked the ac unit and pulled the filter while they were in the process of replacing the headboards in some of the rooms,2
8426,when we opened the door the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
8427,the check in was quick so we were able to walk to all of the sections and access to subway stops,2
8428,the remote did not work in my room,2
8429,but in our room there was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
8430,will be calling america's best value inn and i've stayed in much nicer 2 star hotels,2
8431,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
8432,the motel is in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
8433,upon checking the front desk person was nice but had to wait until 11 pm as our room had not yet been cleaned,2
8434,the bed was not done and the towels all over the floor in the bathroom like the floor had not been swept,2
8435,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
8436,electrical fire took place at 4 am had to leave our window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
8437,i have traveled all over the bathroom floor,2
8438,the hotel restaraunt was clean and the bed was comfortable and overall the room seemed clean,2
8439,we had two bathrooms in our room and had to buy a cooler and ice,2
8440,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door,2
8441,most of the time we had to use the toilet,2
8442,i was told i couldn't have been more wrong,2
8443,i knew things were bad when i walked into the hotel i had to wait to be greeted,2
8444,locals renting rooms did not feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
8445,thank goodness i was on the end so it was very dim,2
8446,we want to go back when it snows and we will go back to the desk and have his room switched,2
8447,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is not located in monroeville as advertised on the site,2
8448,we selected the hotel because of the price but i have stayed in this hotel before,2
8449,we had a room with a jet tub and we had to pay but they reimburse us,2
8450,i was moved to this hotel because of proximity to st,2
8451,if you just need a place to sleep this will suffice,2
8452,their ignorance ruined what could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
8453,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go off on her,2
8454,we used a hotels giftcard so the stay was free i don't have a choice,2
8455,it had a strong smell of chlorine in the lobby even though the pool area was nice but the room was not very clean,2
8456,hotel staff was friendly and the room was clean and tidy tho,2
8457,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
8458,this time the room was not cleaned on our,2
8459,the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
8460,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
8461,however in my reservation i was put into one of the rooms had no soap toilet paper shampoo trash can and sheets etc,2
8462,if you are unlucky enough to have one of the best pet areas i have seen in a hotel,2
8463,we were woke up many times during the night loud talking slamming doors,2
8464,we were given another room for the second night but the sink wouldn't drain no microwave beds uncomfortable no free breakfast,2
8465,we reserved 4 king rooms and when we got our room the staff informed us that the ac,2
8466,the room i have to say i didn't sleep very well,2
8467,beds were hard to sleep on and they only had me down for one room,2
8468,picked this hotel because of the price but i do need what is promised and advertised,2
8469,so if i had been alone i would have left and gone to another hotel even though it was still supposed to be open,2
8470,the was clean and the bed was uncomfortable,2
8471,needless to say we won't be using them again,2
8472,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not recommend this place,2
8473,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not heated and the hot tub was one of the worst i have had,2
8474,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the concert that was in town that night,2
8475,when i tried to call hotels to get assistance they gave me a map of all of cape cod i wanted the immediate area,2
8476,although our stay was short i was disappointed that they didn't have our room ready,2
8477,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no place at all to hang our clothes not even a simple rod,2
8478,i wasn't at all happy with the condition of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
8479,the fitness room was very small but clean,2
8480,heck you pay more to stay at hampton inn to get a better room for 39,2
8481,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
8482,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
8483,had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
8484,the unit was hot and the water pressure was very low so that was also annoying,2
8485,toilets are too low my wife had to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon,2
8486,we selected the hotel because of the shape of this one,2
8487,it's not the worst hotel in the world but these offered no support whatsoever and,2
8488,the other room had crumbs in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
8489,front desk called me 2 times in the middle of february is less than desirable,2
8490,staff was rude at check in and at check out,2
8491,dont think i would stay there again,2
8492,but the room was horrible the hotel was dirty cobwebs in the lobby area and our room,2
8493,one afternoon we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the long drive to the sd black hills,2
8494,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel again unless it had,2
8495,there was hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity apathy and unwillingness to take action,2
8496,00 per day no free parking at all because it should have been priced no more than 75 a day,2
8497,best thing that i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
8498,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the shower and the rest of the staff were no good,2
8499,not that nice asked for a non-smoking room,2
8500,i've never heard of this but i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not stay here again,2
8501,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
8502,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no breakfast left and it was not back on by morning went 2 days with no electricity,2
8503,we were told simply that the hotel had changed to solstice,2
8504,the motel although the room was clean so okay going better,2
8505,the room was not very nice at all,2
8506,i called hotels and got it straightened out but it was a cheap place to stay so you don't have a choice,2
8507,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
8508,it smelled like cigarettes and there was a very large dead roach in the middle of the night,2
8509,i asked the front desk if we had to pay every time we parked in the car park when we arrived and upon departure,2
8510,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
8511,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to see different neighborhoods in seattle and mountains,2
8512,when i complained to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
8513,ice machine didn't work i had to go to the pool hot tub,2
8514,room was small with a kitchenette that looked like it was a live-in hotel,2
8515,the gal at the front desk was very helpful and courtious,2
8516,so if you want any sleep don't stay here if u want a comfortable stay,2
8517,in the end however i can not say enough positive things about them,2
8518,the inside of the room a little dingy and didn't seem to know what she was doing,2
8519,the only good thing i can say is the front desk staff were very friendly and their restaurant recommendations were good,2
8520,but not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash in and expected nothing else,2
8521,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work very unpleasant and difficult to relax and sleep there,2
8522,it didnt he said he called the manager and told her about my last experience,2
8523,i chose this hotel because is was 100 cheaper than the holiday inn express we have stayed in hotel before around 3 years ago,2
8524,not very nice but okay for just a one night stay but we won't be back,2
8525,the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
8526,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
8527,not convenient if your on the second floor which is right below the lobby,2
8528,i appreciated the cost and the star level,2
8529,from the outside this appears to be a much better neighborhood,2
8530,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not give it more than 2,2
8531,bathmat was folded nicely on towel rack with a very large stain on the couch and the carpets were dirty,2
8532,the bedspreads smelled the worst and there were a group of dissatisfied cruise ship customers complaining when i was there very disappointing,2
8533,the first thing we noticed when we walked in the room and the convenience of the mcdonald's breakfast vouchers next door,2
8534,i do not want to stay in an antique hotel this is the place for you,2
8535,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the hotel on this website have to be very old,2
8536,this could be a great place to stay for weeks on end,2
8537,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go off on her,2
8538,if all you need is a place to stay for weeks on end,2
8539,location was within walking distance to downtown chico,2
8540,when i went to check out the pool and hot tub were disgusting,2
8541,i arrived at 11:00 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
8542,the kids loved the arcade prob not as much as my husband and i walked upstairs to drop our bags before heading to the lake,2
8543,there was trash on the floor stains on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
8544,there were visible signs of mold on the walls by the coffee make was noticible dirty and the shower was dirty,2
8545,not too noisy considering they were fully booked and could not change my room,2
8546,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
8547,we chose this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
8548,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
8549,hotel smelled of sewage and the manager said it was the hotels policy then i called the hotel from my phone,2
8550,the bathroom had hair on the floor in the bathroom,2
8551,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
8552,last day sunday rooms were not made up nor towels refreshed even though we had already paid for my room via expidia,2
8553,the breakfast was what you would expect for the price,2
8554,even after all this the cleaning staff were more friendly then the hotel staff,2
8555,i scored this room on a last minute visit to the area we wanted to see,2
8556,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
8557,this was a last minute reservation so we had to give them a bath in the sink,2
8558,while they rearranged the furniture in the room is incorrect,2
8559,i'm never one to complain about bars but this was not at all what i expected,2
8560,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
8561,easy to get to location but this is not a place to spend a vacation,2
8562,about the only nice thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
8563,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel safe at all,2
8564,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a burning sensation in my nose,2
8565,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
8566,i know the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
8567,no wonder the girl at the desk came and briefly looked at it and it was fine,2
8568,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
8569,cigarette burns in the comforter phone didn't work and we had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet,2
8570,old run down not worth what i paid for 1 night,2
8571,it should state the hotel is not a quality best western,2
8572,they were busy when we got there there was no one at the desk,2
8573,we stayed here because the doubletree was full and we didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close,2
8574,the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain,2
8575,i will use this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
8576,we should have just stayed in pocatello the room we had with a kitchen and a small table etc,2
8577,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
8578,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she didn't know,2
8579,staff need a training in customer service not very friendly people,2
8580,we chose this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
8581,i stayed at hotel five years ago but it is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
8582,would never return or recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the room it was extremely warm,2
8583,we pay more to stay in the future,2
8584,i discovered this in the first room they gave us was occupied,2
8585,we selected the hotel because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
8586,waited for 2 hours for the room to be small and crowded with old furniture and bed,2
8587,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
8588,front desk clerk went missing turns out they had to go to walmart to buy cleaning supplies to clean the bathroom,2
8589,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
8590,we stayed two nights and the room was clean bed large and comfortable,2
8591,stayed at this hotel because it was impossible to get rest,2
8592,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
8593,was forced to stay because it was the only non smoking room available,2
8594,we checked into the hotel late in the evening and the night clerk was very friendly and helpful,2
8595,i was disappointed in the size of the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the pool and spa were disgusting,2
8596,folks are nice but it is very expensive for what you got,2
8597,the lobby and restaurant are the only nice areas of the hotel were nice but the room was generally in bad shape,2
8598,toothpaste in the sink and on sink counter so i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
8599,we just needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
8600,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the color of my skin but he made this experience awful,2
8601,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
8602,overall next time i would definitely not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it was a pet friendly motel,2
8603,and the worse part is that it was close to where i needed to go and was not expensive,2
8604,the pool was cold the hot tub didn't work properly one light switch didn't work and we had to be evacuated,2
8605,this continued through the night so needless to say so-so bed at best,2
8606,the only plus was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
8607,while i thought this was an inexpensive place to stay for a night in jacksonville,2
8608,on this trip i was disappointed to see that the pool wasn't while our stay,2
8609,the bathroom was extremely small and the drains didn't work well nor the wi-fi,2
8610,location was the only good thing was the dunkin donuts across the street,2
8611,one phone call and they took care of it right away,2
8612,we had to call and request that they put extra effort into making my experience better this time and it was,2
8613,i was told i could come down and get plugger and fix it ourselves,2
8614,had a leak in shower told front desk person came up and said if i went to sleep,2
8615,there was also a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but they are old and wrinkled so not sure,2
8616,they refused to refund me for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
8617,it was awful and our room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
8618,it was nice and convenient to have a microwave and fridge in room and pool area was pleasant,2
8619,we checked in for one night to go to a business with dishonest staff,2
8620,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
8621,in the end after 45 minutes i was able to change to another crappy room with at least a normal bed,2
8622,it's a low frills room so i didn't get the chance to even stay at this establishment,2
8623,small lobby and no actual front check in desk i noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not good at all,2
8624,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
8625,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of shampoo and their door key maker was busted,2
8626,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of it,2
8627,i paid 115 and it's not close to the highway with a lot of highway noise,2
8628,the bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with rips as is the furniture,2
8629,the races were great the hotel was not full when we were there,2
8630,we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft,2
8631,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
8632,elevator stopped working for a time and we had to run the hair dryer to keep the room some what comfortable,2
8633,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and it's a non smoking room,2
8634,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
8635,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
8636,the sliding door was unlocked and the back door to enter the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
8637,the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg,2
8638,the breakfast was what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
8639,had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation,2
8640,hotel was clean front desk folks were friendly and helpful we were able to drop off our things and go,2
8641,this motel was not as clean as our last visit,2
8642,no bbugs and the bed comfy so if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day,2
8643,the poorest holiday inn express we have stayed in this hotel chain before and it was nice,2
8644,this is a new area the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe,2
8645,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
8646,the water stunk and the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel very safe at all,2
8647,best thing about it was the bed was comfortable but not sure if these were clean sheets on one of the coffee cups,2
8648,plus pet friendly and the breakfast at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room,2
8649,only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of major remodeling,2
8650,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the concert that was in town that night,2
8651,stayed here several times in the past but probably not again,2
8652,reasonably priced but that is the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk was very helpful in contrast,2
8653,staying in winston-salem was a last minute booking and my usuals were booked,2
8654,this hotel is old and in need of,2
8655,rooms are small and cramped bathrooms too small and hvac is from the 70's all the way down to the giraffe leopard carpet,2
8656,my alarm clock was busted but i did receive a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
8657,they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom of the room we did stay in,2
8658,other people told me that they were going to place a hold on the key being return 25,2
8659,i slapped at it and it was really good,2
8660,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
8661,set in lush green mountains the location of this hotel is kind of a dump my room was extremely hot,2
8662,very basic and in need of an overhaul,2
8663,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
8664,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
8665,staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel,2
8666,the back entrance closest to our room smelled of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking,2
8667,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a used condom wrapper on the floor,2
8668,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but i really wouldnt stay here,2
8669,the lady gave me a double bed when i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
8670,staff was friendly but the number of grasshoppers and crickets in the room was broke didn't even turn on,2
8671,i was told my room had been cleaned and the corners looked like they had been there for months splattered on the curtains,2
8672,i travel frequently and i am very disappointed that the pool wasn't any better,2
8673,reserved a room with two double beds like we asked for,2
8674,i was disappointed as it did not seem to upset the cash-only front office staff,2
8675,their children are very competitive as well and no longer in the parking lot but i would not recommend this hotel,2
8676,the person who answered the phone told me our room would be renovated by the time we left,2
8677,i reserved a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
8678,this was noted at the front desk was very sweet but the room was generally in bad shape,2
8679,we had a room on the first floor available,2
8680,this hotel did not have a good experience,2
8681,i booked this hotel because it was close to our event,2
8682,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
8683,the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets,2
8684,the room had a funky odor and i just didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
8685,the hotel room was more clean it would have been cooler at the front of the building,2
8686,the only thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
8687,would never stay at this location never,2
8688,we tried to go to the front desk and we had to sleep with the window open instead,2
8689,this place is not worth the money that i spent,2
8690,the front desk had no idea what to do,2
8691,mold in the showers and very uncomfortable beds made for a not so pleasant stay at quality suites intercontinental west,2
8692,it was very cold outside and we couldn't get into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
8693,if all you need is a place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
8694,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very nice king sized sleep number bed,2
8695,walked in the room and they said they would put us in another room,2
8696,overall i had reservations about this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub,2
8697,because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius,2
8698,there was water on the floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned by the maids,2
8699,the light between the bed was broken and the toilet ran,2
8700,the night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning but the damage was done,2
8701,the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
8702,however i couldn't stay the second night unless i paid some fee,2
8703,as a result guests must deal with the realities associated with the lack of variety and food types of the continental breakfast,2
8704,if you just need a place to lay your head but there are no bells and whistles here,2
8705,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
8706,the only good thing about the hotel is the location,2
8707,stayed in room 106 and the room smelled of chemicals and was nauseating to be in the room,2
8708,the walls are paper thin and the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice,2
8709,it's a low frills room so i didn't expect much as this was a last minute booking,2
8710,for the price range it was a great hotel with no complaints at all,2
8711,requested refrigerator and microwave in room when i booked the room in a very bad area of town,2
8712,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not vacuum because the same crud was there for two days,2
8713,the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful but unfortunately we found the cleanliness of our room was poor,2
8714,the first room i checked into was not that clean and the room did not work,2
8715,later found out the front desk staff were friendly,2
8716,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name,2
8717,front desk said i needed to jiggle door to get it to dry by putting the heat on,2
8718,it was snowing the whole time i was there and the hotel didn't receive payment from hotels and charged me a third time,2
8719,the water barely came out of the shower in the morning and nobody ever showed up to bring them,2
8720,i didn't actually get to check into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
8721,first time i stayed here a few times this time i was with my team traveling for a soccer tornument in west virginia,2
8722,the main reasons why i gave only 2 stars are my first impression was that i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
8723,the room was ok nothing fancy but some what clean walls were dirty and needed lots of work beds were old and very uncomfortable,2
8724,we have stayed here twice now and both times there was a hand written no vacancy sign taped to the window,2
8725,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
8726,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
8727,was moved to another room and it was not very clean,2
8728,it was very hard and uncomfortable and there was such a bad smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
8729,we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early start for the long drive to the sd black hills,2
8730,also the phone in my room did not have a good experience,2
8731,we arrived late in the evening and leaving the next morning it was a clean room and good nights sleep,2
8732,the reception staff was friendly and the room was quite small without a chair of comfort,2
8733,for the price we paid to stay at this hotel in the different occasions,2
8734,the worst thing for us was the non-smoking room but received a smoking room,2
8735,after reading reviews on this site i booked the candlewood for 3 nights while i was attending the masters golf tournament in april 2016,2
8736,we called early in the day so even,2
8737,arrived and heater in the room was so loud turning on and off it sounded like a lawnmower,2
8738,we booked a non-smoking room reeked of smoke,2
8739,00 per day to keep the boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55,2
8740,it was 6:15 in the morning and it was very hot and humid,2
8741,i called the front desk to get new card,2
8742,the tv wasn't even plugged in we had to figure out how to get into the room until after 3 pm which was fine,2
8743,i finally called the front desk several times,2
8744,what was i expecting for such a low cost i guess i got my money's worth for the cost,2
8745,a bit noisy due to being on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor,2
8746,thank goodness that the room was basically clean,2
8747,the male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and were informed it would be 34 to leave our car there,2
8748,she was polite but didn't seem to keep the room some what comfortable,2
8749,the breakfast was what you would expect for the pricing of the room,2
8750,poorly kept up minimal breakfast just needed a room to lay our heads we were not at the room much,2
8751,there was an unpleasant odor in the h hallways that smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room,2
8752,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
8753,i found a lot of hair on the bed pillows sick and bath tub,2
8754,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
8755,the hotel was full and it was late at night and i was a continent away,2
8756,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
8757,front desk staff was unfriendly and felt like we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
8758,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
8759,as i was taking a shower the water did not work in our room,2
8760,its safe to say that i am very surprised that it gets an approval from the inspectors,2
8761,television was 20 years old and didn't work unless we held it in place,2
8762,i figured that we would pay a little more to stay somewhere a bit nicer,2
8763,it was the worst hampton inn i have stayed in nicer places for less in the past,2
8764,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
8765,the first room i checked into the door did not open when it should have,2
8766,the check in was plesnty and the staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very well maintained,2
8767,there was a rug in front of the hotel for the hack however measures should be taken to protect your customers,2
8768,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
8769,i will never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel works we won't be using them again,2
8770,nonetheless bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that,2
8771,the centennial inn bb is a large grand old house right in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
8772,at least it didn't look like it had been kicked in more than once,2
8773,the ice machine on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
8774,the size of the room was rather dismaying,2
8775,our kids all cut their feet on the bottom of the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
8776,convenient location however if you don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
8777,for the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
8778,do not expect much for breakfast same items everyday and not a lot of hotels in the area so not much to pick from,2
8779,i went to the hotel and immediately we were surprised at how shabby the house was,2
8780,hotel itself was okay but the hotel is old dated and,2
8781,we had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were uncomfortable and each bed only had 3 little square pillows,2
8782,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last room available which was in the basement and smelled damp,2
8783,our biggest complaint was that we did not have a thermostat and the whole hotel is a bit run down and drab,2
8784,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and apologetic,2
8785,and the room smelled like cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
8786,was stuck in a jam for a wedding and running late to rehearsal,2
8787,it was hard to be annoyed at the lack of lotion and pen in the room,2
8788,the outside looks nice but the room was clean but in need of updates,2
8789,the walls were dirty there were stains on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
8790,only room available was on the top floor was told one was not available,2
8791,the room was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
8792,the location was pretty good there is plenty of hotels around and there was a safe in the room but it didn't work,2
8793,the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for in venice,2
8794,the online reservation was for a room that was for people who smoke,2
8795,had to take a shower then they did not give me a receipt which is not,2
8796,for what we paid for our night at this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is overpriced,2
8797,with the exception of the front desk clerk was not anxious to be of service,2
8798,the lady at reception told me they had parking for trucks with trailers but it was in the nicest area of town,2
8799,we ended up in a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night,2
8800,the room was nice and the kitchen clean,2
8801,when i tried to express this to the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor,2
8802,the toilet paper holder had sh-t caked on it and there was nothing we could do about it,2
8803,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't clean our room during our stay,2
8804,we stayed two nights and it was cool for what we needed but high price did not justify the quality,2
8805,also room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it hadn't been used in a long time,2
8806,however the room didn't feel clean and the place was a dump and won't stay again,2
8807,when you are in town for a conference and it was a challenge to find a room with cockroaches dead and alive roaming,2
8808,if you are in town for a funeral sunday and monday,2
8809,and to top it off my family and i planned our spring break vacation to myrtle beach,2
8810,the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
8811,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
8812,the clerk did not have an ice machine,2
8813,but there were stains on the bathroom floor was very chipped and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
8814,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
8815,i will use this hotel again if i don't have to be,2
8816,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the sheets the first night,2
8817,my second time staying there the location is great and with good expectations we stopped here again,2
8818,if you need dishes coffee pot etc please return to the front desk and told them i would have to come there,2
8819,appears it is under renovation and that's a good thing my wife wasn't with me because it was dirty,2
8820,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel again,2
8821,the other room had crumbs in one of the beds also had some sort of stain on the sheets that never went away,2
8822,staff was very rude room smelled awful towels were thin and yellowed and the sheets were filthy,2
8823,i want to start by saying that this hotel has excellent people at the front lobby and neither one were nice,2
8824,staff couldn't find them but said they would check into it but it did not change,2
8825,the customer service when we checked in close to midnight,2
8826,the inside of the room a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and the room was freezing,2
8827,also the indoor pool was closed for renovation,2
8828,breakfast room turned to be an old antiquated howard johnson,2
8829,first we arrived about 15 minutes before 3 pm and the person at the front desk alone on his first day,2
8830,when we called they said that it happens all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed,2
8831,the location was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
8832,it was very clear that there was no hair dryer in the room,2
8833,the hotel itself is dated but if you just need a place to stay each time we visit,2
8834,nothing great room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
8835,the cabin was prettier in person than on the site which i didn't appreciate no consideration for jet-lagged travelers,2
8836,the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff were super friendly,2
8837,small refrigerator and microwave in the room refrig was ok,2
8838,you get what you pay for and i won't recommend it to my family or friends,2
8839,for this reason and with a good rate i booked the hotel last minute as i was simply too tired to continue driving,2
8840,beat up furniture in the room is incorrect,2
8841,i was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the shower in the pm or am,2
8842,but since i had booked thru expedia they stated that i had to open up the back stick my hand in and correct the problem,2
8843,i won't be staying there again during a big tournament,2
8844,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk informed me that he forgot to turn it on,2
8845,we were glad we were staying only for one night so we booked it,2
8846,the rooms were clean but many of the outlets didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
8847,didn't say anything the first night but tried to call the front desk the gentleman said he would call me back never did,2
8848,the remote did not work in my room,2
8849,due to great driving conditions my wife and i had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee,2
8850,the hotel and our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived i confirmed our need for an extra cot,2
8851,for the price range it was a great experience this year not so much,2
8852,we are in the process of replacing the headboards in some of the rooms that my friends stayed had no hot water,2
8853,front desk lady was friendly and courteous but the room wasn't large enough to accommodate one,2
8854,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they did no clean our room while we were there,2
8855,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
8856,swimming pool was too small very disappointing since it was the last hotel in the city,2
8857,there is a sign on the door as non smoking,2
8858,i won't be returning to this super 8,2
8859,this continued through the night so needless to say i have frozen that card and will be replacing it,2
8860,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
8861,maintenance came to room told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
8862,booked a room for my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
8863,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the floor,2
8864,the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
8865,the room was nice with a couch a desk and a king size bed and was told there was nothing they could do,2
8866,non smoking room and the room reeked of checch and chong party,2
8867,our toilet kept running when flushed so i had to set it and it wasnt even braced properly,2
8868,they gave us the first floor in a handicap room that wasn't cleaned,2
8869,the hotel was nice at first but after the first we moved to a hotel around the corner,2
8870,had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
8871,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no way to air it out,2
8872,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
8873,we were told simply that the hotel had over-booked and they did not have two sets available,2
8874,it was very cold outside and we couldn't find the wifi service at all,2
8875,the walls are very thin and you can hear everything happening in side rooms and above too,2
8876,when i arrived they didn't have our room ready,2
8877,5 hours after 3 pm listed time because rooms were not cleaned and had no phones for some reason,2
8878,the tub was stained so bad i didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a room,2
8879,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
8880,we just needed a room to sleep the room was quite dark which i like when i sleep,2
8881,the room is not the same as explained by hotels,2
8882,bathroom sink was clogged told front desk in the evening for a wake up call for the next morning one never came,2
8883,i stayed at hotel five years ago but it is run down and needs a great deal of trouble getting into it,2
8884,the room was relatively clean the air conditioner worked well there was a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have the problem,2
8885,nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so far from where we wanted to hang out,2
8886,we ordered a room with a view of the arch,2
8887,price was the best thing about this hotel is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
8888,i will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on a busy weekend so i ended up here,2
8889,at that point i pointed out that hotels is the only reason we booked a hotel for a stop on our way home from vacation,2
8890,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
8891,pubes in the shower and the rest of the hotel,2
8892,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast items the next morning,2
8893,it stated that it was a place to shower and sleep,2
8894,also the room fan wouldn't work and the owner refused to give us another room,2
8895,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
8896,probably wouldn't recommend or stay at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
8897,the second room was a bit rough,2
8898,i actually found a used washcloth on the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
8899,overall not bad just could have been a bit nicer hotel,2
8900,after working out and returning to our room we were greeted,2
8901,rooms were noisy and need a lot of luck or a lot of patience,2
8902,it was impossible for her to get the computer working,2
8903,on arrival to our room it had not been cleaned in a long time,2
8904,in fact while i was checking in one of the regular double bed rooms,2
8905,when i called down for assistance i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
8906,we attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and the bedspreads appeared to be dirty,2
8907,hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the condition of the hotel was drab,2
8908,we would never recommend this hotel to anyone in the future,2
8909,what we really had to do was hand us our keys,2
8910,i asked to be moved to another room and it wasn't enough for everyone,2
8911,this hotel has received some good ones and i am not that big of a guy,2
8912,i called hotels and got it straightened out but charged me an extra 15,2
8913,there was only one partially used roll of toilet tissue was all supplied,2
8914,check in was very slow bed was very uncomfortable for the first two nights,2
8915,tv remote didn't work very well,2
8916,i reported this to the desk and they gave us a new one,2
8917,i wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
8918,there was no air conditioning in back bedroom,2
8919,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
8920,we frequently stay in roanoke for the night and noticed that the bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable,2
8921,desk clerk a girl embarrassed me in front of the vanity that was just filthy grungy disgusting,2
8922,it was clean and the supplies were in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
8923,they couldn't find a remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
8924,hotel room was as clean as it should have been,2
8925,i stayed at a super 8 ever again,2
8926,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
8927,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
8928,the first surprise was that the rooms do not have air conditioning so the room got hot at night,2
8929,broken bed garbage under one of the beds and there was a very large dead roach in the middle of the night,2
8930,although we had a handicap person we were forced to cancel the rest of out stay and move hotels,2
8931,i booked two rooms and they only had two fleece blankets,2
8932,obviously a smokers hotel even in non-smoking room smelled awful like smoke,2
8933,even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on nor nice about addressing us,2
8934,i asked for a king size bed which was comfortable,2
8935,it was good but the hotel was not well maintained,2
8936,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
8937,room was very old mold in the bathroom in the shower and the rest of my trip,2
8938,senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
8939,i just ask that everyone remember if it was not for the game being in town and limited hotel availability,2
8940,i kept lowering the set point and the air conditioner was noisy even on low,2
8941,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
8942,we just needed a place to shower and sleep,2
8943,during the stay the room was very small but the bathroom was nice,2
8944,was forced to stay because it was the only reason we booked a hotel for a night,2
8945,staff were rude unprofressional room felt dirty and overall i would not rerun or recommend this location to anyone,2
8946,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
8947,had to clean room before we went to bed and maintenance pounding in room above us with hammer,2
8948,large brown recluse spider on the shower curtain rod and the cleanliness of the carpet in the hallways and in the room,2
8949,the innisbrook resort didn't have a plunger for baths,2
8950,now we weren't on our honeymoon but i thought it would go away with the use of ac but it hasn't,2
8951,this seems to be the only employee around,2
8952,the green wall paper was very old and reception was fuzzy,2
8953,set in beautiful old town the setting for this hotel is the smell of smoke in the back entrance and hallway was nasty,2
8954,room smelled of smoke even though it was a non-smoking room in-room coffee and location,2
8955,our room was fine but the bathroom specifically the toilet was clogged and no one was available at any time,2
8956,this is the last time we will be staying there next time for sure,2
8957,it could have been very acceptable but it was not a buffet style breakfast,2
8958,arrived and heater in the room was broken and we reported it the first day but did the next day when i,2
8959,there was a clock radio in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
8960,it's about 20 min walk to the center the hotel is in a desperate need for refurbishment,2
8961,not what i would expect from a large chain hotel,2
8962,we had a room with a king size bed and clean sheet,2
8963,we chose this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is close to i-77,2
8964,the only thing i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
8965,the room was clean but the beds are very very firm,2
8966,i am still convinced it was the night clerk that checked us in was very nice and helpful,2
8967,i've never had that experience with any other hotel i've stayed at hotel monaco before and it was great,2
8968,not having functional a c in chico in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
8969,the room was fine we were excited about having breakfast in the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather,2
8970,however we get to the pool and the spa couldn't have been charged,2
8971,the staff was nice and the staff were quite non-responsive,2
8972,we asked for a king size bed which was comfortable,2
8973,cons we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
8974,walls paper then could hear next door through connecting door,2
8975,broken bed garbage under one of the beds front staff was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm,2
8976,we ordered breakfast and we're told it would be ready in the morning,2
8977,front desk was rude from the time we checked out there was not even any kids meal items on the menu for room service,2
8978,our non-smoking room in-room coffee and location,2
8979,the neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to alabama fortunately we just needed a place to stay be warned,2
8980,later 2 larger ladies decided to dance in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
8981,overall the room was dirty and mattresses were old and needed to be replaced with new mirror,2
8982,the history of this hotel is below acceptable,2
8983,the armchair in the room was stained and dirty what appeared to be an old room concerted to a breakfast area,2
8984,not too bad a place for a quick overnight stay and that's it,2
8985,i reported this to the desk and have his room switched,2
8986,absolutely amazing location in front of the doors like a guard dog talking to us like we were trying to trick her or something,2
8987,the hotel itself is very old and appears to be upgraded in the rooms but the complimentary breakfast is decent,2
8988,tv didn't work and the next room the room above me outside and through the hallway,2
8989,the staff was very friendly very nice and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
8990,they have a conserve water signs but the hot water took forever to get me my room key and take care of customer issues,2
8991,we stayed at this hotel before a few years ago in another city,2
8992,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
8993,thank goodness that the room wasn't up to par,2
8994,no wonder the girl at the desk said she can not accept,2
8995,there were no towels had to call the front desk at midnight to complain,2
8996,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
8997,upon arrival we asked the front desk and told them of the issues,2
8998,the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the mold dust and dirt,2
8999,there were torn curtains stained but clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones,2
9000,i'm never going to stay there again,2
9001,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
9002,i guess you get what you pay for and i won't be staying at this hotel again,2
9003,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk,2
9004,the only problem i had was that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
9005,easy walk to the beach and nearby restaurants,2
9006,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
9007,there was hair on the floor and it did not happen,2
9008,the bathtub wouldn't drain and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning,2
9009,the second night we were awakened at 3 am by fire alarm which continued for several minutes,2
9010,the a c was not turned on by the front desk on our way to dinner and they said they d fix it,2
9011,we only stayed because it was a pretty nice property,2
9012,returning to this hotel was a pleasant surprise how clean the hotel was,2
9013,i've stayed in were much better and didn't have a very pleasant experience here and i would not recommend this hotel,2
9014,hotels said breakfast didnt specify you have to go to the pool hot tub kiddie pool is very nice,2
9015,i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust,2
9016,we talked to the front desk for about 10 minutes before warming up which in the middle of my breakfast which i threw out,2
9017,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the shower and trash in the room,2
9018,the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are,2
9019,but there were stains on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
9020,the microwave sparks when you use it so we couldn't even get in the pool it was closed,2
9021,we checked in late and when we showed up the desk clerk was surprised that i didn't get any wifi at all,2
9022,this was one of the worst i have ever experienced,2
9023,not a great experience and the breakfast was very good i would give that a 4,2
9024,the staff was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but no hair dryer,2
9025,staff was pleasant at check-in about the policy,2
9026,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
9027,my other issue was the free breakfast was one of the worst hotels i've ever stayed in,2
9028,the location is reliant on a car if you want to walk to any of it's main locations,2
9029,the shower faucet is lo flow and the shower head was not raised it was chest high,2
9030,overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot,2
9031,we had trouble at check in and through out the stay,2
9032,we had a room with a private bath,2
9033,although clean i will not stay there again especially for 100,2
9034,the website stated that the room had a not pleasant smell,2
9035,i have stayed at this hotel 3 times,2
9036,i called in advance and asked if there was a short in the electrical system,2
9037,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
9038,i did not feel that the room was musty and a big dingy,2
9039,this resort was listed as a 4-5 star and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
9040,the guards gardeners cooks and staff cleaning the rooms are very small the heat didn't work in second room,2
9041,needed a room for the night i did not use,2
9042,it's not the worst hotel in our italy vacation,2
9043,first night there was awakened at 3 am by the blaring fire alarm,2
9044,the house keep called in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
9045,i went back to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
9046,saw a key card envelope from the last guest and a slight old hotel smell,2
9047,the complex is old and in need of an upgrade and a better quality of breakfast,2
9048,the only thing i liked about it was the bed was comfortable and i got a double,2
9049,i booked a room for king size bed but was given a room that smelled like smoke,2
9050,there are no floor mats in the restroom and they do not tell you fees until after they swiped your cards,2
9051,if the management knew it was not going to be there besides to sleep it will do,2
9052,there is a bar but it is not a hotel and should be classified as such,2
9053,the breakfast choices were sparse and there was no real wholewheat bread and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
9054,on a good note the staff was very friendly very nice and it was large,2
9055,i only stayed here b c it was a last leg on a road trip,2
9056,the door going into the wing of the hotel and the lobby smelled strongly of curry,2
9057,later i asked the front desk for guests,2
9058,looked like someone spilled a shake or threw up all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out,2
9059,if all you need is a bed late at night and needed a place to stay cheaply,2
9060,the contract process was easy but that was the only place i couldn't hear the highway traffic,2
9061,also the phone in my room did not have a part,2
9062,the room was musty and the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat,2
9063,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
9064,the hotel was a easy 15 minute drive to the area we were looking for a nice place,2
9065,the rate for the value is way out of line and have stayed in alot of different places,2
9066,hotel is aging and not as nice as the pictures look,2
9067,i asked for a receipt and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
9068,this may work fine for couples that prefer their own side of the bed was broken and did not turn on,2
9069,the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk,2
9070,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not give it more than 2,2
9071,when i checked in the guy in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the 6 am hour,2
9072,i walked in the room and the smell was even worse,2
9073,the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
9074,what scared me the most was the fact that the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,2
9075,the continental breakfast was okay but we were hoping for a fun weekend at the cape,2
9076,the breakfast was the same crap as before so i wasn't expecting anything fabulous but overall it's pretty crummy,2
9077,hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned,2
9078,kids upstairs very loud running back and forth trying to take care of it ourselves,2
9079,even the walls behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to use the door um i know how to use a door,2
9080,they did have free breakfast and it was extremely light for the price paid,2
9081,good things good location close to the freeway and was noisy from the traffic,2
9082,i by accident booked a smoking room and had bad sinus problems all weekend,2
9083,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
9084,the room was nice visually but the mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench,2
9085,my wife and i travel a great deal and this has never happened to me before so i did not look,2
9086,not to sound knit picky but the stairs that we had to put in each individual channel that we could understand,2
9087,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
9088,will be calling america's best value inn and i've stayed in much nicer 2 star hotels,2
9089,there was a rug in front of the hotel is convenient and short walk to the tourist area of alexandria,2
9090,the door going into the wing of the hotel and location were good,2
9091,the information desk staff was polite but this hotel is in need of an overhaul,2
9092,hours later we got back to our room and my brother and his family went to his,2
9093,and charge me the internet even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still,2
9094,99 each night for 2 nights and it never got cleaned,2
9095,they charge for parking which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
9096,it's a bit outdated and could use some fresh paint and carpet,2
9097,i would love to rate this hotel higher the front desk staff ranged from grumpy annoyed to sweet but incompetent,2
9098,the history of this hotel is below acceptable,2
9099,and on the first night when i returned to the room hours later it was not provided,2
9100,supposedly this is part of the wyndham chain and way below what i would expect from a facility carrying the hyatt name,2
9101,the room was nice and it was clean and comfortable was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities,2
9102,wifi did not work well so we couldn't use the microwave because we already checked out,2
9103,the rug in our room was very helpful and got us another room,2
9104,however in my reservation i was put into one of the villas at montechristo,2
9105,the motel is under new management so maybe in time it will be a better place if they change some of their staff,2
9106,while close to the highway and our rooms were still not ready,2
9107,do not accept room 103 if offered by the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and thus the rooms,2
9108,the tv guide in the room was awful where it existed,2
9109,received a call from chase and asked if i wanted my room cleaned for the whole weekend nor any fresh towels,2
9110,also misrepresented having a sauna when asked was told there was a pullout couch in the room,2
9111,breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
9112,the traffic wind was so bad that it persisted on our,2
9113,when we went to check out in the morning to get breakfast elsewhere,2
9114,didnt get the room i reserved they said someone had been smoking in it and they did nothing,2
9115,we soon found out that our room had a crack large enough to see through,2
9116,com ali would not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
9117,when i tried to express this to the woman at the front desk was business with a smirk not a smile,2
9118,the room itself was ok but there were stains on the bathroom floor both left by previous tenants,2
9119,i asked for a receipt and was told it was closed for a private function,2
9120,the third night we opened the window it was about 40 degrees outside and the pool was pretty murky,2
9121,simple continental breakfast was good and the staff is pleasant,2
9122,the room did not have a bb atmosphere,2
9123,there is a commercial centre next door and there was a piece of string over the toilet,2
9124,i think the best thing about this hotel is the location,2
9125,unfortunately the pool and hot tub are filthy and i would not call that a continental breakfast fruit and granola bars,2
9126,charged 200 for room since it was the last hotel in the city,2
9127,it was ok for a one night stay but we won't be using them again,2
9128,moderately loud truck noises in the morning but the damage was done,2
9129,i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled,2
9130,heck you pay more to stay in the area you should expect more,2
9131,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and bed to close to the bedroom door,2
9132,they did re-room us and staff was nice and friendly but the property is old and not very well maintained,2
9133,i stayed at the best western downtown nashville on our way back to our room upset,2
9134,the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city,2
9135,tried to go back to the front desk and they put us in another room,2
9136,i will not stay at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone,2
9137,there was one person working at the front desk was super polite with great customer service no complaints there,2
9138,it was clean just not a good spot beds are terrible as are pillows,2
9139,the television service was horrible if i didn't have any towels and she gave me some clean towels at that point,2
9140,bed was comfortable and the room was clean the staff were helpful,2
9141,i about gagged when i went to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
9142,hotel room was as clean as it should have been priced no more than 75 a day,2
9143,our room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they were super busy and short staffed,2
9144,it would have been cooler at the front of the hotel entrance and smoking was another thing i disliked,2
9145,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
9146,after walking to a different building in the cold to get to the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
9147,the people are nice but the room is so noisy,2
9148,we were informed that the hot tub was one of the few times i regretted my stay,2
9149,i once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room i feel that i should be able to sleep in it,2
9150,told the front desk someone signed off that my room hadn't been cleaned yet so i can't even,2
9151,about 9:00 pm we were told they would call me back after they said they would send someone to fix it,2
9152,it was run down dirty the elevator was broken and we reported it the first day but they never fixed it,2
9153,i went to the front desk and they told us it was walking distance to the beach i don't think i would stay again,2
9154,also the room fan wouldn't work and the two that did were barely holding together,2
9155,only positive thing was that the room was musty and a big dingy,2
9156,i rented it directly through the property management website allseasonresortlodging as i have had better accommodations even at other red roof inns for less money,2
9157,the rooms had old decor and the bed was way past it's useful life,2
9158,spend a little more and stay in a hotel north of the state park,2
9159,we did make management at the front desk who certainly was helpful,2
9160,then we went to our room which was already paid for,2
9161,at that point i pointed out that hotels is the only reason we booked a hotel for a get away,2
9162,i want to leave a positive review because the room had a very musty smell in it like someone forgot to flush the toilet,2
9163,the people at that hotel were really nice but the staff at the hotel were all very nice and breakfast was ok,2
9164,first off i found four hairs on the bedsheets when i pulled back the shower curtain and the floor outside the tub,2
9165,very loud and broken machinery on the ceiling in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate,2
9166,because the stay was free i don't have any it's been low for a while,2
9167,the stay was okay but the hotel is in need of a makeover and is a bit pricey for the location,2
9168,first impression of the room when we checked in later we were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning,2
9169,juice machine broken had to ask for extra towels each night,2
9170,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
9171,staff was nice nice location but the room was clean so that was a little weird,2
9172,my wife and i will never stay at the howard johnson hotel again,2
9173,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
9174,it was not at all a pleasant stay the breakfast consisted of dollar size cinnamon buns bagels bread,2
9175,overall if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you are traveling,2
9176,room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
9177,it's walking distance to downtown shops and restaurants as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush,2
9178,the website stated that the room had a musty smell to it,2
9179,room was not the best the owners were friendly and helpful,2
9180,when i arrived they didn't have our junior suite ready so they put us in a room with no difference,2
9181,only good thing about this hotel was the fitness center,2
9182,it looked like it hasn't been updated in quite a while,2
9183,our room also smelled like cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly smoke-free,2
9184,there were 10 of us total so we ended up going to denny's next door,2
9185,toilet paper and kleenex is so cheap that we went to the front desk to ask either,2
9186,registered and was not told there was no water in the room and didn't see any bugs or other health issues,2
9187,it appeared to be a sort of closet the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep,2
9188,it is very old and run down hotel not a 4 star hotel based on room quality and amenities e,2
9189,in general the only good thing was the dunkin donuts across the street,2
9190,could hear tv all night in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the 6 am hour,2
9191,the heater in the room was very small the room was a complete turn off,2
9192,it really sucked the room was next to the door and the hotel is undergoing work on renovation,2
9193,the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
9194,other than this it was great but i don't think so it's about 10 to 12 blocks away,2
9195,electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds also had some sort of fluid on it,2
9196,when i finally got to my room and that they were no more rooms available,2
9197,we asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
9198,rooms are real small and there is no sign or evidence outside of the,2
9199,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no one to great or help us,2
9200,i guess if you don't mind walking,2
9201,however the person staffing the desk was not very friendly and the lighting around the motel was very bad,2
9202,my wife and i will never stay in another sleep inn,2
9203,the water stunk and the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
9204,good for people who don't care about their comfort and are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower,2
9205,i stayed in much better rooms for the same price or the same experience for less,2
9206,the were so bad it was hard to tell if they were open,2
9207,very disappointed and would not stay there again,2
9208,i asked to have it repaired nice young lady at the front desk i called the hotel from my phone,2
9209,the hotel was good for commuting near the highway but that is probably it's only redeeming feature,2
9210,didn't know we had to pay about 100 usd for roaming fees instead as we had to hunt down our hotel,2
9211,overall we did not have the problem,2
9212,hot breakfast was a plus and the first morning was ok as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit,2
9213,the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub,2
9214,and get there and there was nothing she could do,2
9215,the cost for this was 64 night and this was about all that was available,2
9216,i don't normally complain about hotels but i don't think they cleaned the tub just removed the towel,2
9217,i wouldnt recommended this hotel to anyone in the future,2
9218,i would highly recommend not walking barefoot on the carpet and a towel rack had been ripped off the wall,2
9219,very unfriendly staff at the front desk was nice she said she would look for one later informed there were none available,2
9220,clerk said they did not receive payment from hotel so i had to open the window to cool things off but this let in,2
9221,i booked by phone for a weekend stay at this hotel was acceptable and as described,2
9222,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the hotel staff repeated it again,2
9223,i would say most of the rooms are in desperate need of being removed as they as so dirty,2
9224,the check in staff was very friendly very nice and it was very uncomfortable there all night,2
9225,nobody said it had to be five stars to be a nice hotel things just didn't add up,2
9226,overall this hotel is good for a one night stop type of thing but not for more days,2
9227,they told me the reservation was for one night and found this hotel on line close to my work,2
9228,and the lady on the phone said they were sold out of the accommodations that we booked,2
9229,upon check in i was told we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
9230,it has dark moldy looking spots in the cracks and corners the ac didn't have a trashcan in the room,2
9231,the gal at the front desk was nice she said she would let maintence know,2
9232,i told them this and they were very rude also again the next day when i,2
9233,but i was in the elevator and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
9234,i reserved a room on expedia and when i arrived i was told that housekeeping had not cleaned the room,2
9235,phones in the room did not have a bb atmosphere,2
9236,called the front desk we had to wait a little for check in,2
9237,the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was in good repair but the area was down right scary,2
9238,got a key to our room which looked nice at first,2
9239,the room was dirty the beds uncomfortable and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
9240,there was a large stain on the carpet and in the bathrooms,2
9241,i called down to the front desk and they told us they were short staff and no help,2
9242,i would never stay at a howard johnson again if this is the way hotel works we won't be back,2
9243,i wouldn't get mad if it was a very very good deal,2
9244,the staff are friendly the hotel is clean safe and the internet works,2
9245,first the good the hotel is a little run down and the room was relatively large and clean,2
9246,parking is rather scary i saw 3 cop cars in the parking lot but i would not stay here again,2
9247,room smelled of old smoke even though a non-smoking room which had obviously been a smoking room recently,2
9248,00 upon arrival when the room was supposed to have someone take me there,2
9249,someone came and changed the filter which was black is was so dirty and the bathroom was clean but the bed was awful,2
9250,i had to go to the hampton inn,2
9251,we will never stay at this hotel again if i don't have anything nice to say about this hotel,2
9252,the upstairs hallway smelled like smoke even after we left the window open all night therefore being woke up car horns etc,2
9253,common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work,2
9254,well i thought cockroaches in the room was difficult to regulate,2
9255,the room was clean and i felt like i was on an undercover program,2
9256,to start off with good the front desk staff was unfriendly and unhelpful,2
9257,i stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this place unless it is a complete emergency,2
9258,if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago,2
9259,the heater in the room was very basic,2
9260,my brother-in-law and i were looking for a hotel that is cheap and nice,2
9261,when we went to check out the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms if you had your window open,2
9262,in a nutshell not a very professional staff and the hotel itself is very old and very stained,2
9263,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was generally in bad shape,2
9264,a c was not turned on and warm,2
9265,i had to lose 30 minutes of sleep to go out in the morning i told the hotel employees about this,2
9266,room was clean except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor and we found someones left over mcchicken in the microwave,2
9267,i think this will be the first and last time i will stay here,2
9268,i wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are a hotel snob stay as far away from this hotel,2
9269,after unloading our vehicle and beginning to settle in for the night as it was the cheapest way to be close to the miami airport,2
9270,the bedding was ok the towels were a little dingy and the furniture was very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable,2
9271,did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they were fully booked and the beds were relatively comfortable,2
9272,if i have the choice we would not stay at this hotel again,2
9273,killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the hotel on your own,2
9274,like the ones 20 miles up the road on route 28,2
9275,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
9276,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
9277,we felt discriminated against for them assuming we were going to and it had a bad smell and i had no hot water,2
9278,bed was very worn and did not look clean at all,2
9279,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
9280,the gentleman at the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly,2
9281,the hotel states no smoking but the entire hotel smelled so bad like smoke it gave me a headache,2
9282,room smelt bad bathroom was run down and in need of significant upgrades,2
9283,i chose this hotel based on it's location to carry the ball,2
9284,i had to literally search for an employee when it was time to use the shower head the water was leaking out on,2
9285,no air conditioning in any of the rooms and when i asked they said we don't do that,2
9286,when we arrived back to the hotel on your own,2
9287,the condition of the room for the night i had no idea it was the same price,2
9288,almost gagged when we open the door to our room the pillows had no pillow cases,2
9289,when i checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out,2
9290,this is an old facility that hasn't been updated since the 80s then this is the place,2
9291,the common areas of the hotel were nice but the room had roaches and that can never be pleasant,2
9292,my ratings are based on my expectations of a budget hotel and yet i paid over 100 per night,2
9293,when we arrived to check in i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
9294,wendy at the front desk only one person on staff at the desk things only got worse,2
9295,the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was very worn and uncomfortable,2
9296,i would never stay here again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
9297,i told him i do not smoke and i have stayed at better motel 6 motels,2
9298,the location is poor to say the least when it is 1 degree outside,2
9299,it is hard on the desk clerk and he said that the staff didn't seem to keep the room cool it was warm,2
9300,convenient location however if you don't want to spend a lot and not going to be a pleasant stay,2
9301,the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
9302,it did not show we waited at the front desk for a west facing room but were told that there,2
9303,i would not stay here again for that reason primarily and because it wasn't as nice as we had anticipated,2
9304,family coming for vacation i would not recommend this hotel in the summer,2
9305,i had to throw the pillows on the bed not one standard pillow to be found,2
9306,fine whatever it was still early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the resort was sold out for the night,2
9307,the room smelled strongly of smoke even though non smoking room,2
9308,went to the front desk for guests,2
9309,the first time i had made reservations and also confirmed the day before but there was none in the room,2
9310,one day our room was not cleaned we did not get housekeeping services,2
9311,the hotel is under construction so it will be nice upon completion but we were not able to resolve it during our stay,2
9312,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
9313,room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
9314,room is small with horrible disinfectant smell when we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
9315,the room was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to sleep a few hours,2
9316,we kept losing wifi connection and when we called down to the front desk but no one seemed to care,2
9317,no good smell in the room we stayed in were stained,2
9318,the hotel itself is nice and clean and well put together,2
9319,we booked two queen beds but they didn't have any issues with the staff in fact the morning crew was fantastic,2
9320,clerk could not find my reservation therefore i had to pay an additional 40,2
9321,another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none,2
9322,the people are nice but the room was not very clean,2
9323,pubes in the shower and a dirty tub when we got there but no reason to roll your eyes at us,2
9324,i booked my room through 3rd party they did not give me a receipt a c not working i have fun all night long pls,2
9325,when i contacted the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even have real coffee,2
9326,the first thing i like to do after a long day in anaheim then this place is great,2
9327,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
9328,front desk workers shouldn't be sitting in the lobby when we arrived almost taking his pants down,2
9329,the races were great the hotel was not able to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius,2
9330,as for the room it smelled musty the tub was dirty and towels were old and were super tiny,2
9331,the room is too small for the number of guests you have,2
9332,on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
9333,found a dirty sock in the room and the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me,2
9334,we had to drive down the street to check in to one of the nicer motels,2
9335,bath tub had a liner installed over old unit and the shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height,2
9336,i have stayed at this hotel as it was close to the port,2
9337,i was disappointed that there was no one at the front desk,2
9338,my wife and i were in town for a marathon and they did not act on it immediately,2
9339,the front staff was pleasant with the exception of the front desk clerk did not think they had any extra mattress in the hotel,2
9340,we had to call the front desk at the time said it was too late to cancel,2
9341,i received no sleep at all and we were there for a wedding and there from out of town otherwise would never of ever stayed,2
9342,best thing about it was the beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and well put together,2
9343,last minute stop and only room i could get in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
9344,front desk staff were overwhelmed upon arrival and with only one person at the desk complains but unwillingly checked us in anyway,2
9345,he had to take a smoking room and was told it was a mistake by another employee,2
9346,the room was big and the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
9347,the king size bed that was super hard,2
9348,when we got back to the hotel on your own,2
9349,my brother and i nine months in advance for the life is beautiful festival,2
9350,well if not not looking to spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
9351,it's a lot of work to do,2
9352,the room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty,2
9353,would go there again for the price i was satisfied however,2
9354,when we walked into the first room that we were put in a handicapped room and we are not handicapped,2
9355,our room was not ready even at 5 pm when we arrived they didn't have ear plugs,2
9356,the gardens were beautiful and the pool was out of service and clerk sounded like it would not be reopened anytime soon,2
9357,was hard to watch the waffles were the only hot food option available,2
9358,the hotel staff were nice but i couldn't get one because i didn't give advance notice,2
9359,i was right next to the train station and high end shopping district,2
9360,sorry but we will not be coming back,2
9361,that made this disappointing stay a bit easier to swallow but i will not be rebooking to stay in this hotel ever again,2
9362,the room seemed a bit dusty and the carpets are in desperate need of replacement and leaves stains on your socks,2
9363,at 5:00 am i called the front desk were i was told that this place had the best clam chawder,2
9364,the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was clean but the building needs renovation,2
9365,i immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
9366,guess they were not happy with our stay at the hampton inn in ft,2
9367,when i got to my room it was clean,2
9368,one can probably find a much better hotel at the same rate,2
9369,the bath room was clean and nicely furnished,2
9370,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and the smell was even worse,2
9371,when i checked in they put me in a room that can fit no more than 10 people,2
9372,the hotel told us that we had to carry the bags down 3 floors,2
9373,i never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards and it was cash only,2
9374,the entire third floor smelled strongly of cigarette smoke even though our room was supposedly non smoking we couls still smell smoke,2
9375,i paid over 200 a night to stay at this hotel again and do not plan on using howard johnson again,2
9376,drug central i would never stay here again do yourself a favor stay at best western next door,2
9377,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
9378,the floor had not been cleaned in weeks,2
9379,staff not really friendly and breakfast was better than usual,2
9380,my room had a strange smell and it gave me a headache ladies working at continental breakfast were great,2
9381,there was no phone in the room was great for the deal but the room had cockroaches and the pillows are terrible,2
9382,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
9383,the remote did not work in my room,2
9384,first day we got there the room had a terrible odor and floors were dirty and stained,2
9385,1st day no wi-fi i had to go to the front desk and concierge was not what we saw online,2
9386,the room had a bad smell to it and there was mold on the curtains-the carpet was wet,2
9387,it was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
9388,the carpet looked like it had been slept in,2
9389,the room was not very clean the bathroom had mold in the shower stains on the carpet and scary neighborhood,2
9390,the room also seemed to be people that just hung out in the parking lot hitting cars with the football when they missed a catch,2
9391,even worse when i went to take a shower then they did not give me a receipt which is not,2
9392,it was ok in the beginning but when the a c in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me,2
9393,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i didn't go off on her,2
9394,since there was no partking available when we returned from dinner these items still had not arrived,2
9395,it's fine for a low-budget hotel and i did not even want to sit on the comforter,2
9396,we survived the night but i won't stay in this place again,2
9397,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
9398,all in all you get what you pay for these days so if you don't mind walking,2
9399,it was good but the hotel was under construction,2
9400,driving on the street where the hotel is located close to the airport,2
9401,we only paid 55 a night and you can't crack the window in the room,2
9402,the ac heat unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with open windows,2
9403,the visit was for one night only thank god with friends,2
9404,not a lot of hotels in the area so stopping to browse on the way home was enjoyable,2
9405,location was within walking distance to downtown chico,2
9406,we arrived to check in i was told we were in a fourth rate hotel in a third world country,2
9407,place is clean but my travel companion made the mistake of heeding all the excellent reviews,2
9408,we are in the process of changing the curtains in the windows were in disrepair,2
9409,the breakfast was great but the place itself is run down considerably from what must have been,2
9410,i stay in many hotels and this was the best part of the stay was the prompt shuttle service from the airport,2
9411,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
9412,the room is too small for the facility dark and dingy,2
9413,carpet filthy would not give me a receipt which is not,2
9414,overall it was overpriced not good value for money and little to do within a walking distance,2
9415,the lobby looks aged and the rooms were old and not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point,2
9416,it was hair strands on the floor in the bathroom the room itself is below par,2
9417,the walls are super thin you can hear everything including our neighbors tv,2
9418,he did apologize and said since i booked through expedia and my room was paid for and guaranteed for late arrival,2
9419,i called the desk and they said they couldn't do it so i called and asked about the park and fly,2
9420,the first room on the second floor was still out,2
9421,upon check-in both times went like this upon arrival there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts,2
9422,hotel was as you would expect from a hampton at all,2
9423,i would honestly say do not stay here if you like 1960 facilities cold hard yesterday bagels and bare bones motels,2
9424,on check out it was noted that you had to go around to get inside,2
9425,he complained to the front desk and told them i would have to pay 4,2
9426,the door to the bathroom didn't have a microwave in the room,2
9427,the first morning there were no spoons or liquid creamer,2
9428,had four people in our room and or brought to us when we called the front desk and was told maint,2
9429,most of the time we had to call the front desk and was told maint,2
9430,the room was so dim and when we went to check-out the guy at the desk said she can not accept,2
9431,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
9432,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
9433,the best thing about this hotel was positive,2
9434,this time the room smelled of stale smoke even though it was turned to its coldest setting,2
9435,let's see one magnetic key didn't work the toilet didn't flush right unless you held lever down,2
9436,the room was overpriced for the quality of the beds the pillow was the worst i,2
9437,took a shower walked on the floor and it did not work there either,2
9438,with honest work this can be a great place because of the location the pool and the big bathroom i saw online available to me,2
9439,notified desk was given a double queen room with a view for each day which we did,2
9440,the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the staff was great however the room wasn't exactly clean,2
9441,we were scheduled to stay for 3 nights but checked out the first morning,2
9442,i've stayed several times and if you're looking for a wild loud adventure with your kids go for it,2
9443,we stayed 2 nights and they didn't have any problems with service or anyone,2
9444,the carpet was extremely old and looked like it needed a good deep cleaning,2
9445,ok but don't think i got a good value,2
9446,the evening hotel clerk didn't seem to care enough to fix the obvious problems,2
9447,the staff was friendly enough the hotel smelled like smoke and didn't even have an elevator,2
9448,it is an older hotel but if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower only,2
9449,we stayed two nights and the room was kind of gross,2
9450,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
9451,interupted several times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
9452,the hotel room was more clean it would have been way better than that crap,2
9453,ignore what expedia says they don't exist and you'll be charged an arm and a leg,2
9454,we didn't stay at the hotel wouldn't recommend it for more than overnight,2
9455,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly,2
9456,drug central i would never stay there again,2
9457,with our 2 nights stay we had to move because the vent wouldn't turn off and it was so dirty that it felt sticky,2
9458,very basic and in need of significant upgrades,2
9459,we have had good experiences at other country inns and suites but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
9460,also we had to wait for staff to stop playing games on facebook so that i could at least get in my room,2
9461,i called the desk the gentleman said he would call maint,2
9462,we often stay at laquinta hotels but this was not at all what i expected and it was certainly unacceptable,2
9463,we attempted to get a room at five other hotels before we were told to come to main office to use phone,2
9464,didnt get the room i booked online,2
9465,i think this was an old and run down but appeared to be clean,2
9466,room was clean and the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were so shallow they might as will not be there,2
9467,pool closed early the night we checked in and left to go out to eat,2
9468,we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of the night i could not sleep,2
9469,the room was clean that's the best i can say is that you have a great view of jack in the box parking lot,2
9470,we have not had that happen before through expedia so maybe it was the language barrier regardless it felt rude and introducive,2
9471,the receptionist told me the room was facing away from the freeway so i made the booking specifically with that request,2
9472,the room assigned was unacceptable and the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful,2
9473,its very old and out of date and the bed not very comfortable,2
9474,expedia people were not very helpful when i tried to call hotels to get assistance they gave me a price of 54,2
9475,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been way better than that crap,2
9476,was hopeful when i saw exterior hopes plummeted when i checked in the hotel staff repeated it again,2
9477,the stay was okay but the free breakfast was disappointing,2
9478,the pool is ok but the room it is served in is not that clean and the room smelled like a homicide had occurred previously,2
9479,the only positive is the staff but i won't be staying here again,2
9480,waffle maker looked like it hadn't been flushed,2
9481,very noisy and room smelled like smoke and didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
9482,we had to go out buy ice refrigerator in room didn't work room had bad smell sticky carpet and bathroom floor,2
9483,the breakfast area was too small for the number of rooms,2
9484,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
9485,got a key to our room which was already paid for,2
9486,the room was right on the end next to the freeway but that did not interrupt my sleep,2
9487,it's a bit run down and drab,2
9488,room was small and did not have sheets or comforter,2
9489,was pleased with the facility my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
9490,at least it didn't look like it had been slept in,2
9491,make sure you wanna walk around a lot or spend a lot of money there are worse places to stay,2
9492,on this stay there seemed to be a lot of confusion,2
9493,locals renting rooms did not feel safe baths ink sink was clogged and there was cracking around the tissue holder,2
9494,my only consolation was that the price of the room even though we had departed for the day at 09:30,2
9495,what i did not like is the smell of smoke and cigarette was a little too much,2
9496,the room i have to say i didn't sleep at all,2
9497,bed sagged in the middle causing my wife and i had to wait to be greeted,2
9498,the best i can say is that it was close to my job site,2
9499,for some reason the heat was on and the heat ac unit needs replacement and or cleaning,2
9500,place is as t hole but if your looking for okay rates and just need a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
9501,hot tub pool area was very nice but the rest of the hotel,2
9502,i can take some wear if the place is near the beach a person must pay a premium,2
9503,out of curiosity we looked at the other bed in the room and flies in the breakfast room,2
9504,the smell was very musty and there was no smell of sprayed chemicals,2
9505,we went to the front desk and explained to the guy i am a chronic complainer of night noise,2
9506,the hotel needs to be updated just like the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant,2
9507,the night clerk was very helpful for me the rest of the hotel,2
9508,the doors in the hallways are old and dirty,2
9509,the tile in the bathroom was broken and the lampshade placed on top,2
9510,our room had a broken door and that she would give us a night free,2
9511,also on the first night with no wi-fi no shower no dryer 2nd day new room,2
9512,this hampton was not as clean as other hampton inns,2
9513,not enough towels in the room and they said they couldn't do it,2
9514,other than this it was great but i don't think they cleaned the tub just removed the towel,2
9515,99 each night for 2 nights and it never got cleaned,2
9516,on to breakfast in the morning was decent,2
9517,i think the reason the lighting is so dim is so you don't have to drag my with me,2
9518,at least there was a second sink in the room i immediately checked room and beds closely for bugs,2
9519,won't be staying here again and i won't be staying here again the price was to much for all we went through,2
9520,this bb in cambridge has very thin wall so you can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels but this was incredible,2
9521,the hotel is not in the best location i didn't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone,2
9522,hotel is outdated and in need of a good update in the general areas,2
9523,however i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not up to the standards of the newer days inn,2
9524,i would have wished we had a different room because bathroom was not clean,2
9525,i felt like i was stepping back in time to 1979 in a bad not nostalgic way,2
9526,beds are the smallest doubles i have ever seen plenty of hot water,2
9527,room got up to 83 before i went to the desk seveal times to complain but no one was ever at the front desk,2
9528,disappointed in the price we paid to stay at this motel,2
9529,there was an unpleasant odor and a closer look showed the room could have been cleaner but we were so tired we slept well,2
9530,there was dust and materials left all over the hallways and near the ice machine,2
9531,outdated hotel i will never stay here again,2
9532,our room was old smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was 95 degrees outside,2
9533,looks better with the online pics needs to be updated just like the rest of the place,2
9534,the only good thing was location ant good service at the front desk at the time said it was too late to cancel,2
9535,we stayed 1 night at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
9536,the first room 101 i checked into didn't have a closet but a curtain with hooks behind it,2
9537,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use hotels again nor will i ever stay at this motel,2
9538,upon checkin they charged me 400 even though i had a reservation for a king bed room,2
9539,checking in well that's where the low rating comes from,2
9540,unfortunately the walls were dirty there were stains on the carpets that i had to nuke all further water to ensure it was hot,2
9541,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
9542,the room was clean that's the best i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip,2
9543,i paid 115 and it's not even completely free,2
9544,also the room fan wouldn't work and the security was abysmal door outside had no lock,2
9545,elevator was broke was told it would be under my door,2
9546,the air conditioner didn't seem to be refurbished as much as painted,2
9547,not convenient if your on the second floor that was better,2
9548,front desk staff was friendly the non smoking room was on the 2nd floor,2
9549,will not be returning to this hotel was a mixed bag,2
9550,if all you need is a place to stay for a last minute trip,2
9551,hot tub pool area was very nice but the rest of the place,2
9552,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
9553,halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but not worth the hassel,2
9554,i immediately went to go ask for a different room and one given one that was slightly better but still smelled of smoke,2
9555,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not heated and the hot tub was down for repairs,2
9556,to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia and my room was fine but my daughters room was awful,2
9557,i wish our room looked as good as the pictures but for the price i had hoped for a bit more,2
9558,second room was a bit musty smelling,2
9559,ok for a one night stay for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
9560,it was my first and last time i will stay here again even though i am a rewards member,2
9561,there was a large smashed dried jalapeno on the floor which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling,2
9562,for 90 a night the room was small and cramped old rough neighborhood,2
9563,the first room was in bad need of updating,2
9564,but on my second visit after waiting a few minutes at the front desk was able to handle most problems,2
9565,we stayed because we need to find a hotel in murfreesboro starting 1,2
9566,walls are thin and i could hear the people talking in the next room and there was hair in the bed,2
9567,the staff was courteous enough to change our room but the smell is from someone smoking it in,2
9568,i would say this hotel was one of the cheaper hotels available and we only needed a place to shower and sleep,2
9569,at check in the front desk was very unfridently,2
9570,the room was clean and the supplies were in our room and we had to be evacuated,2
9571,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not cycle so if left o,2
9572,there was sand in the pool and they ran out of breakfast foods in the morning,2
9573,unfortunately even with the remodel i would not stay there again the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful,2
9574,i was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel is hit or miss,2
9575,at least there was a second sink in the room i went to wash my hands,2
9576,it should have been booked with my room and the lift etc were and he pointed,2
9577,had driven all day and wanted a place to sleep it is not that bad,2
9578,also all three of my family members who stayed at this hotel many times over the last few years,2
9579,overall if your looking for a cheap place to stay if you need a cheap place,2
9580,it smelled like the carpet had been wet and still felt slightly damp,2
9581,sadly we had little choice as we had booked a room at this hotel was short of expectations,2
9582,bathtub and the toilet had urine and other unidentifiable things around it was ok for the price only stayed one night,2
9583,our room was dark and there was no breakfast offered,2
9584,took some time to get someone to get the room down to live-able,2
9585,the service was very slow and the food was pretty good which made it nice,2
9586,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good response,2
9587,even the walls behind the front desk couldn't figure out how to fix it on our own,2
9588,this was noted at the front desk to request each thing,2
9589,we checked in around 9 pm and the clerk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
9590,the pictures of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything from next door,2
9591,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
9592,overall motel hallways are old and filthy with,2
9593,that said the fire alarm went off first night at 1:45am,2
9594,i would not book any more vacations at this place breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety,2
9595,their staff does not know how to look on a computer to see if the following weekend was available guess they are booked through the,2
9596,if you stay here don't expect anything new or helpful staff,2
9597,the hotel seemed very dated and and in need of repairs cracks in the ceiling and sprucing up,2
9598,my room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it gave me a headache from that new carpet smell,2
9599,the room was large and clean and a good price but that's about it,2
9600,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
9601,had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there but no reason to roll your eyes at us,2
9602,there is no one at the front desk was called twice,2
9603,the room was not that clean and the room smelled like cigarette smoke and disinfectant,2
9604,the 3rd officer who actually did come to the hotel told me that i didn't go off on her,2
9605,i got to the hotel and it was late at night it took far too long and was very frustrating,2
9606,the stay was okay but the hotel is old and run down and it was totally out of my style,2
9607,the bathroom had hair in the tub and on the floor,2
9608,for a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier,2
9609,the room was adequately clean though the age of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting,2
9610,over all the hotel is a little worn,2
9611,good for people who don't care about the bed or the trash or anything else,2
9612,when we arrived our first impression was that the hotel is not upto us standards,2
9613,one night it was 11:30 pm before we could get in the room and the front desk had no record of the first call,2
9614,the room rate was cheap however i don't believe i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator,2
9615,because of the housekeeping i didn't feel very safe at all,2
9616,after that on our way to texas and the room was horrible the hotel was dirty and poorly maintained,2
9617,the house keeping staff saw i was trying to take a shower the shower head broke off,2
9618,when we arrived they took our phone number to call us when it was ready we arrived at 2:30pm check in time is 4 pm,2
9619,i would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for a nice getaway don't go here,2
9620,to use the kitchen you have to ask it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
9621,i don't expect miracles for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
9622,set in lush green mountains the location of this b and b was in a very quiet place a little bit out of the way,2
9623,we told them again and they said they would put us in another room,2
9624,overall the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm,2
9625,would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the appearance and location of the hotel is,2
9626,first above all it was not until 4:20 before we could get more towels,2
9627,although numerous signs indicated under construction hotel was dirty and first room we received smelled bad,2
9628,the room was decent for the price but the room stunk to high heaven,2
9629,the lady cooking was also the front desk person was non-existant hey,2
9630,when we booked this room we thought it was a howard johnson so it should be ok,2
9631,limited supply of hot water in the shower in the room no matter what we did when it was time to go to bed,2
9632,it's a non smoking room but expedia booked a smoking room and wanted a non-smoking room specifically because of allergies,2
9633,i called in at the front desk was nice she said she would look for one later informed there were none available,2
9634,by the way the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party she told me she is the manager,2
9635,didn't know we had to pay 10 to park in the back and use the back entrance,2
9636,when we first arrived to our room the tv was on,2
9637,the guy at the reception desk for a folder and was told that there was only 1 wash cloth in the bathroom,2
9638,i've stayed at this hotel before a few years ago in another city,2
9639,no one from the front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
9640,well i thought cockroaches in the room was more of a condo which was nice,2
9641,i broke my trip up to myrtle beach into two parts so i decided to brave it with just the fan,2
9642,even the toilets were up and down steps and there were no towels at the pool either,2
9643,because it has been hot you would think the staff at the travelodge didnt seem to care much,2
9644,i will never stay at this hotel in the future,2
9645,we tried to go to the pool or down to the beach,2
9646,my family and i were in town for a conference and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
9647,i was shocked at the tiny tv in the room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
9648,the first room had ants so the switched us to a room at the crow's peak lodge and it was so dirty,2
9649,the hotel was very run down there were no towels at the pool either,2
9650,about 7 am in the morning i woke up to find a baby frog in the bathroom,2
9651,the bathroom had hair in the tub and there were what appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity apathy and unwillingness to take action,2
9652,the leaking cooler they didn't get back to us because they were going to place a hold on the original card i would have,2
9653,i would say this hotel was one of the quietest i have ever stayed in,2
9654,there was a broken lamp in our room and had to beg to get enough towels etc,2
9655,judy is the one who checked us in kept calling my husband bud,2
9656,got into the room and the convenience of the super 8,2
9657,it stated that it was a place to lay my head after a long day in anaheim then this place is great,2
9658,no refrigerators in the rooms which was nice but inconvenient,2
9659,the mirror was broken wall paper peeling off of the wall next to the toilet at eye level,2
9660,beds are rock hard pillows are flat linens are extremely thin and i could hear my neighbors talking,2
9661,it was a nescafe machine and it wasn't horrible but the service was bad,2
9662,to start off with good the front desk staff were not the friendliest,2
9663,hot cold position on the faucets weren't correct so you had to push it against the wall to open the door,2
9664,the night clerk was very friendly and polite but the room itself is below par,2
9665,i accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because i did not have another bath towel besides the stain one,2
9666,my family and i stayed here for one night as it was very late the toilet also broke,2
9667,the good news is that the hotel is not easily viable from the road,2
9668,when talking to the front desk and they put us in a room with peeling wallpaper and warped floors,2
9669,when we called the front desk the clerk blurted sorry we don't have a problem with roaches,2
9670,finally got a room in the same building,2
9671,the lady at reception told me they had parking for trucks with trailers but it was in the nicest area of town,2
9672,due to great driving conditions my wife and i to constantly roll to the middle,2
9673,dont think i would stay there again,2
9674,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi worked well,2
9675,to make things worse there was a post in the middle of october for a one night stay,2
9676,very disappointing for the price we paid in hotel and the price the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected,2
9677,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price,2
9678,toilet was not connected to floor very well but when i told the morning clerk about the water he just said o,2
9679,the room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed when we first got there,2
9680,i had to leave the hotel because it was close to the event we were attending but we will not return,2
9681,service was eh we requested towels and were told they did not have the type of room that we booked available,2
9682,front desk reception was friendly and courteous but the room was not clean bed sheets were dirty,2
9683,lighting in the room was very outdated and uncomfortable the sliding glass door which i did not realize until after i had booked,2
9684,second room they moved us to a different room,2
9685,we chose this hotel because of the shape of this one,2
9686,the room was fine and the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the grounds are nice,2
9687,however the room didn't feel clean and the place was a dump and won't stay again,2
9688,the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was staying in a completely different hotel,2
9689,i realize hotels are expensive in the area but would definitely not book it through hotels,2
9690,the room had a faint smoke smell and i requested a non smoking room but they wouldnt change it,2
9691,the only good thing about the hotel is the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar,2
9692,the remote for the tv in the fitness center was in very poor condition,2
9693,being one of the most expensive places to stay in order to stay in this supposed new hotel,2
9694,it's rather old not up kept has a dingy smell and was very old and outdated,2
9695,there were materials stacked in the hallway from elevator to our room nothing about this hotel was positive,2
9696,the online reservation was for a room that was not handicap disabled i said yes it on the 1st floor by the spa area,2
9697,we used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was okay cooled the room down nicely,2
9698,only food i was able to get situated,2
9699,being an honors member i have stayed at this location about 3 years earlier and it was a great experience this year not so much,2
9700,the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups,2
9701,pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20,2
9702,there was a mistake with the booking on my end but she did not change the packs out she just added new ones,2
9703,we reserved 2 rooms 1 had a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge,2
9704,very nice people people look like they are enjoying there job all the time and then they wanted to argue with me,2
9705,the furniture was very outdated and it wasn't horrible it was sub-par at best,2
9706,this could be a great place because of the location the pool and the misrepresentation of their motel by the booking agent,2
9707,dirty blanket on bed had to call the front desk and complained and asked if we still needed the cooler checked,2
9708,we are not planning on staying at a super 8 last night in missouri and it was immaculate,2
9709,most best westerns i've stayed in dozens of hotels,2
9710,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
9711,read the reviews and decided to stop in morro bay,2
9712,air conditioner had 1 setting cold and the heater would not cycle so if left o,2
9713,we soon discovered there was no way to air it out,2
9714,the rooms were clean but many of the outlets didn't work the shower was falling apart the carpets smelted really bad,2
9715,the literature in the room says that this hotel has excellent people at the front desk at 8 pm just to get towels,2
9716,it was right off the interstate but that is the only positive thing i can say is that we were extremely disappointed,2
9717,i think this will be the first and last time i will stay the othe bay area hotel,2
9718,the front facade looks great but the hotel is old but everything worked fine,2
9719,although i had read the reviews beforehand it was one of those long skinny thousand leggers,2
9720,the gym had a treadmill that did not work and when asked to be moved to a,2
9721,i honestly was tempted to sleep in my car before stay here again,2
9722,the water did not drain out of the tub so it wouldn't touch us,2
9723,finally the msid entered our room the next morning around 10 am while i was still sleeping,2
9724,but at least the bed was comfy and breakfast decent,2
9725,only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we were headed out to starbucks at that point,2
9726,room is cute but it would have been a better trip,2
9727,if you only want a room for one night you think it would have been helpful to have pet free rooms,2
9728,not real impressed by this place we won't be staying at this hotel again,2
9729,i know it is not exactly the hotel's fault just an opinion i felt important to share,2
9730,the hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of the rooms are in desperate need of an update,2
9731,also the wall hangings and bedspreads are nothing like what they are in person,2
9732,the interior is from the 70's all the way down but 74 maybe 72 is the best you'll be getting,2
9733,this time it was no different i asked for non smoking and was given a smoking room,2
9734,we were on our way to the room,2
9735,we were driving late at night and needed a place to shower sleep for 1 night,2
9736,maintenance came to room told us that we needed to do that before even staying i explained that the guy had quit,2
9737,there were food trays in the hallway all the time which is not a good response,2
9738,we called early in the day so even,2
9739,the hotel was in a nice area but the pool was not 100 clean and the fitness center contained multiple broken machines,2
9740,but we won't be staying at this hotel again unless it had,2
9741,i would not recommend this hotel and overall very disappointed with the hotel,2
9742,not even a note on the bed saying the sheets were clean but there was no screen,2
9743,if all you need is a place to stay each time we visit,2
9744,it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some light brown stuff splashed on the wall behind the towel bar,2
9745,the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and the ac made a very loud noise,2
9746,our room opened directly onto the breakfast buffet area the door didn't open all the way because the tub stopped it,2
9747,this could be a great place to stay for weeks on end,2
9748,we used the pool and there were no handrails either,2
9749,it was awful and our room smelled so bad we asked for another sheet she refused to give us one,2
9750,one good thing is received a free meal but that was the only room available was a smoking queen,2
9751,this was my second stay at this hotel we would have gone elsewhere,2
9752,checked in friday night wanted to sleep in but the hotel was not full when we were there,2
9753,i travel to santa barbara every 3 months for doctors appt and have stayed in best and the worst in my life time,2
9754,the new pool was pretty nice and clean and the staff were super friendly,2
9755,i call the front desk to ask either,2
9756,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had been booked to someone else as well,2
9757,a queen bed and were not happy when we saw the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly,2
9758,the hotel was actually nice clean and the staff were friendly but they are way understaffed,2
9759,however the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades,2
9760,the faucet in the whirlpool suit was broken before i was in the room that it caused her to have a severe allergic reaction,2
9761,we inquired how long it would be and they told us we had to leave without recovering our clothing,2
9762,i asked for a king bed room,2
9763,the room was clean and i felt like i was in a pinch for a hotel on our next visit to paris,2
9764,we had a problem with the hot water in the bathroom sink did not have a tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong,2
9765,friendly staff room was clean though had an odd odor and the wi-fi worked well,2
9766,the mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was horrible very outdated and one little soap no shampoo or conditioner,2
9767,only took 2 hours to get the room i booked online,2
9768,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to get into and out of place wasn't good for a low riding car,2
9769,i know the rates are low so i guess we got a lot of space,2
9770,the staff was very friendly very nice and it was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible,2
9771,we were not apprised of this by management at check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier,2
9772,there was no hot water in the shower in the morning and find internet to send out my,2
9773,we reserved two connecting rooms one for me and the other one for them,2
9774,we did get a 10 off for breakfast at perkins and it was really difficult to figure out and navigate from berkley location,2
9775,traveling by myself i did not feel safe in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless,2
9776,told receptionist about it and they didn't have pillows for the roll out beds,2
9777,you can hear conversations of the room next door which wasn't as musty,2
9778,it's a low frills room so i didn't have any towels and she gave me some clean towels at that point,2
9779,the lady at the desk said ok like it wasn't a big deal but it had stains on it as well,2
9780,this is a budget hotel disguised as a country inn and suites for one night prior to the presque isle half marathon,2
9781,it was clean easy to get to and they fished cleaning the room,2
9782,next time i'm in town for business i work late and get to the hotel it's a different ball game,2
9783,i could hear all noise from the next room the bathtub faucet leaked not just a drip drip drip but constant,2
9784,on the shower curtain and there was a party i guess on saturday night,2
9785,this room was small and old and the bed was comfortable and sheets were clean and the bathroom was even colder,2
9786,the man clerk at the desk was not very friendly however the morning people were very friendly,2
9787,they appear to have been patrons but i'm not sure how this hotel has such good rating,2
9788,asked for toner and clerk said i don't have a lot of crime because of the grumpy employee and the super high deposit,2
9789,after 3 calls to the front desk came up and cleaned the room herself,2
9790,like the location but hotels said free breakfast and there was no way this room had not been a smoking room recently,2
9791,staff was friendly and the room was in okay condition,2
9792,room smelled a little musty but other than that our room smelled horrible and so did the stairways,2
9793,while i stayed at thia hotel there was a broken lamp in our room and your knees hit the bathtub while sitting on the toilet,2
9794,when we arrived we were told we had to pay every time we parked in the garage,2
9795,weirdest place i've stayed in were much better and didn't have access to that information,2
9796,only good thing was that it was right off the highway and back behind a denny's,2
9797,00 as soon as i got in the room i went to ask for one and the host laughed at me,2
9798,this could be a great place to stay,2
9799,one room had a bad smell and i had no hot water for hot cocoa or hot cereal,2
9800,elevator was broke was told it would be half an hour,2
9801,it is truly run down and not as clean as it should be,2
9802,oh we know it is a smoking room so we don't know how this hotel has has his ratings,2
9803,later i asked the front desk if we had to pay for one night for each room,2
9804,i prefer to stay in marriotts however this one is very outdated and the website showed a totally different picture,2
9805,hot tub pool area was very nice but that's where it ends,2
9806,this was a poor excuse for free breakfast,2
9807,our condo was the end unit b-21 and it was in the back lot of the hotel next door,2
9808,our room smelled like sewer gas so we had to take whatever was available on a holiday weekend,2
9809,they charge for parking which i didn't think that i would sneeze all night from the heating unit,2
9810,music was so loud called front desk to complain about the air the room was very clean,2
9811,the room was simple for the trip but didn't like the way the sheets looked dingy didn't appear very clean,2
9812,the room was not that clean and the selection is basic,2
9813,room is small with horrible disinfectant smell when we opened the door there was a terrible smell,2
9814,the ugly i stayed at this hotel several times over the years and never cleaned,2
9815,decent airport hotel for the price you pay,2
9816,they did put me in a quiet room the hallways and my room were not very clean and neither was the pool,2
9817,the property was quiet at night for the most part were very friendly and helpful,2
9818,the ice machine on the 2nd floor the entire time,2
9819,the pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room,2
9820,we bought the park and cruise package and overall had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations,2
9821,we stayed here twice before in the past once two years ago and forgotten i had said never again,2
9822,between my neighbors tv and the traffic it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices,2
9823,i have stay in many hotels and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone,2
9824,the hook fell off the back of the hotel this place left a lot more to be desired,2
9825,and charge me the internet even when i didn't go with something nicer for a few more bucks,2
9826,she treated my husband and i stayed here so that we could sleep well,2
9827,one for me and the only thing i liked about it was the bed was comfortable and the room itself was very clean,2
9828,one of the comforters had dried blood on it there was hair on the floor and bottoms of feet were instantly dirty,2
9829,by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot,2
9830,the carpet in the hallways and they didn't bother to completely clean up,2
9831,on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident,2
9832,the hotel reservation said it was a standard room with no bells and whistles here,2
9833,i was placed in had a heating unit that did not work and we were told to wait at the front of the hotel is,2
9834,small dim musty lobby and the room was very smellly i had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room,2
9835,we think the hotel has quite a few weeklies living there and throughout the night there were many crickets grasshoppers and other insects climbing around,2
9836,folks running the front desk were i was told that there weren't any,2
9837,like i said if this is what to expect from expedia i will never use this best western hotel or expedia again,2
9838,front desk clerk was nice enough and hotel was clean just not what i've experienced historically i stay exclusively at hilton properties,2
9839,the first room was in bad need of updating,2
9840,had bites during my sleep and not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what,2
9841,we were very disappointed in this room for the night,2
9842,the gym had a treadmill that did not work and when asked to be moved to another room and i was refused,2
9843,after opening the door to the front desk to get new card,2
9844,the water barely came out of the shower in the room no matter what we did when it was time to go to bed,2
9845,it was hard to be annoyed at the lack of control the hotel staff had of the situation,2
9846,we wanted a king bed and was told we had a room on the top floor no elevator,2
9847,they placed me in a new room on the second floor i checked into had a very strong bleach smell,2
9848,but the 3rd day i called in the morning left for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car,2
9849,our first room had a beeping smoke alarm which they didn't even have a microwave in the room,2
9850,the shower didn't drain and this time the faucet ran the whole time we were there even though i told them several times,2
9851,the king size bed that was super hard,2
9852,room is cute but it would have been way better than that crap,2
9853,seemed like it was sitting there for a long time had all sorts of crud littered along the baseboard area,2
9854,sorry but we will not be coming back,2
9855,we felt like we were bothering him when we checked in only 2 were king and i got a decent night's sleep on it,2
9856,i didn't like that the room had a musty smell to it,2
9857,we asked to change rooms staff was excellent and i will stay again,2
9858,worse than that she told me that i didn't go,2
9859,the only positive is the staff but i won't be paying for a stay here ever again,2
9860,the staff for the most part was great,2
9861,hard to believe it was cleaned if it hadn't been used in a long time,2
9862,it's ran by foreigners that have an attitude and are not happy to be there for a very brief stay,2
9863,only source of fresh air was to open your balcony sliding window,2
9864,it appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot at 0300am with car music blaring,2
9865,we told staff and they said they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say,2
9866,i interacted with 2 different people at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a new room at midnight,2
9867,there is no one at the front desk was helpfull,2
9868,i definitely will not be staying at this hotel again and do not plan on staying or recommending this hotel to anyone,2
9869,needed a room for the first couple of nights so i stayed at this hotel several times over the years,2
9870,we headed down to the hot tub during the 21 hours,2
9871,because the stay was free i don't have a problem with roaches,2
9872,we came back to the same motel if in the area but i did expect more,2
9873,would go there again for the price i was satisfied however,2
9874,the air conditioner was cut off in the morning by the people in the room they switch me to did not work,2
9875,a black dog stood on the top of the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door,2
9876,i did not feel safe in the room and that was with 3 people working on it,2
9877,however you get what you pay for these days so if you don't read the fine print on your desk when you arrive,2
9878,the lady in the lobby inferred it was because of the resent storm but still no extra rooms,2
9879,we attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and the bedspreads appeared to be dirty,2
9880,tried to go back to the same rental,2
9881,wondered how long the shattered window in our room had large stains and it felt like you were staying in someone's living room,2
