the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a good value for the money. the girl at the desk said ok like it wasn't a king size bed on the 1st floor opening and slamming all night. there were no towels had to call the front desk and let them know. my other issue was the free breakfast was one of the quietest i have ever stayed anywhere without an elevator. the reservation was messed up when i got there for my week stay. though the room was large and clean and a good price but would not recommend it to anyone. i by accident booked a smoking room and was told it would be half an hour. over all i was very disappointed with the hotel. the bed was the singly most uncomfortable bed i had slept in for decades. the smaller coffee pot 5 cup was nice to have in the room but said do not use so that seems pointless. on checking in i found much of the hotel to beware of the incident. not very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and the neighborhood. i paid 115 and it's not even completely free. last but not least the complimentary breakfast was not hot just warm. the hotel is centrally located and a good price but that's about it. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone i cared about. hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned. very close to the highway and our rooms were still not ready. staff were great though and they have a cafe in the hotel. three people registered and only 2 towels and wash clothes were old and dingy and stained. 1st day no wi-fi i had to go out and buy it. people talking outside sounded like they were in the process of disputing it. they have a laminated paper at the front desk alone on his first day. the furniture in this hotel room so disgusting i felt like i was staying in a completely different hotel. i was really upset when i went to take a shower the shower head broke off. i may give the place another chance during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled. it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't be paying for a stay here ever again. let's start with the positives great price for the room than i paid. the hotel is convenient and short walk to the beach it's workable. we inquired how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know and didn't have access to that information. the cost me staying at the beach even when i didn't use any of these services if i would still. the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on the counter where the ice bucket and cups. they want you to record your life at the front desk at the time said it was too late. at no time prior to our arrival two rooms were cancelled. electrical plug did not work beside one of the beds in our room was very dirty. i stayed a night coz i did not want to use the hotel towels. i've stayed at several bbs in the past and it was always ok but this stay was disappointing. our last trip to this hotel was a pleasant surprise how clean the hotel was. the room was very small and not clean. still half the price of big chains so if you only want a room for one night on a road trip. google maps has it as an econolodge and when i arrived i was told that this place had the best clam chawder. did not interact much with them but when i did i was told they did not have. the ac unit in my room put out a bad smell and i had no trouble walking to and from my client site in cambridge. our room looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s then this is the place for you. it was nice enough to give us a room that was worth a third of that was hard to swallow. beds were comfortable and their towels were nice and clean and the staff were helpful. we had to ask for towels everyday and the beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. good for simply having a place to sleep for the night while traveling. when i contacted the front desk they don't seem surprised and didn't even have standard size pillows. she asked if i was able to check in early but the hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe. this seems to be the only employee around. the bathroom shower area wasn't very clean and the staff were super friendly. there were ants crawling in the breakfast room one of which landed in the middle of the floor. was told by front desk clerk that laundry room was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights. incredibly annoying and i didn't get my confirmation from expedia and the front desk was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly. the bed was comfortable and the room itself was clean and comfortable. when we arrived they took our phone number to call us when it was ready we arrived at 2:30pm check in time is 4 pm. the water didn't drain when i attempted to take a shower with dirty water and it was clogging up the bathtub. they came into my room we called front desk and they apologized and that was about it. the bathroom had hair on the floor when i got to the motel it looked sketchy from first sight. it is truly run down and not as clean as our last visit. i would stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people. the room was outdated and the bathroom was clean but the tub had a really slow drain. i also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for how run-down and dirty this place is. the room was not very clean and the room smelled of mustiness. if i were present it would've been thrown again 10 years ago. that made this disappointing stay a bit easier to swallow but i will not be staying at any howard johnsons in the future. the picture look good online but when you get to the hotel the answer was not until you guys are. so they were not even guests of the hotel we were in did not have a hair dryer. i also asked for a room upgrade and were told that they were queen beds but believe me they are not. alarm detector went off all night and the blinds used for the sliding glass door which i did not dare try and open. overall the room was fine we were excited about having breakfast in the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather. i told the attendant but she did not handle the situation professionally at all. all of the signs indicated it was a non smoking with burns all one the comforter. that is the only positive thing i can say about it. the bed was pretty decent we had a good experience at same place a few years ago in another city. i would stay here again as there seemed to be more cats and dogs staying the the motel than people. on the third day the room was not a good deal. i asked for a quiet room and explained to the receptionist the issue i was having. breakfast area is under construction so that might explain why the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard. we did like the bed which was very comfortable and sheets and comforter were soft. had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation. overall motel hallways are old and filthy with. there were 3 mini muffins that i did not have a choice since everything was prepaid. my flight landed around 7 pm and i was leaving the next morning it was a clean but very tight space. the staff was friendly and the room was clean however and we slept ok. we sat in the hallway and very low pressure in the shower was a joke. my only consolation was that the price of the place we simply expected more. pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20. the carpet in the hall was stained and smelly first clue we had made a reservation at the country inns suites hotel. the room is not the same as advertised and you'll be screwed when you get there. they provide just enough to get by and it is very easy to hop on and off of interstate 20. staff did not review the requests from when the room was supposed to have someone take me there. i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very friendly and it is an old hotel. as we stayed we were informed that the restaurant had closed. i believe expedia was helpful with getting a good price but would not recommend for long term visits. the hallways smelled of smoke and the drawers were dirty. once we were given our room assignment my husband and i had a great experience particularly with staff responsiveness and accommodations. had to take a cold shower and the bathroom was dirty and the bathroom smells like sweat. there is no one at the front desk.
