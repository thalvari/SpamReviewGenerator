great place to go if you are looking expecting a quiet night. we arrived at 40 berkeley in the middle of the night and it was on a week night. worse part there were ants in the room which was fine. i didn't have my hotel reservation the front desk receptionist was very unwelcoming and rude. we were disappointed that we didn't have a room with two beds got one with one king. later i asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the car park when we arrived and upon departure. i think it is safe to say this will be the only time we stay there. i was told i couldn't get over the smelly linens. the negatives including having to listen to the guy in the next room and we could even here the guest upstairs flushing the toilets. our room was specious and had a lot of trouble with the bathroom. nonetheless bed was comfy and clean and we got a good rate through expedia felt good about that. now the shuttle service to from jax airport was very good and the beds ok for sleeping. there were cigarette burns on the toilet seat. the tv was bad no mattress pad on bed but mattress comfortable. hotel staff in groups standing just in front of the door and the entrance surprised no one cut themselves. how funny we were told that the hotel had over-booked and they did not act on it immediately. the front desk assistant was really rude and short with me. ok no biggie next morning we called the front desk and we had to be evacuated. then when i checked in the guy in the front desk clerk was very nice. the tv remote had some sort of stain on the sheets. failed to tell me when booking the room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room. only only only plus for this hotel is quite run down and in need of significant upgrades. i don't like having to go to the lobby to ask for it to be this bad. well they must be in the midst of vacation season but the old saying you get what you pay for. unfortunately we decided to book a night at this hotel and were happy to leave. the air conditioning in my room was a twenty inch lg. and the worse part is that it was close to my job site. i called the front desk and request it. the hotel itself was not the best however it was good for one night wouldn't recommend for more than a couple days. i immediately went to go ask for a different room and one given one that was slightly better but still smelled of smoke. and the worse part is that it was close to universal studios. the room was warm as the a c was broken not very comfortable in 103 degree heat. the only good thing was the water was hot and the air conditioner worked great. our non-smoking room smelled like smoke could not get the tv to work. it was good but the hotel was dirty and poorly maintained. i was really disappointed with this hotel it is definitely not a 3 star. took a shower walked on the floor and it did not help to have a room for the night i did not use. staff was rude at check in and at check out. the carpet looked like it hasn't been updated in decades. common areas were attended to daily but the carpets in the hallways are not secure anyone can walk in the rooms need work. i called the front desk for hand towels they gave me a double bed when i booked the day before but to no avail. the only think that was great about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios. didn't know we had to pay 10 to park in the back and use the back entrance. pros location is great staff is friendly and easy access to i-20. the mini fridge was not turned on by the front desk on our way to florida and back. senior citizens who had to climb 3 floors because elevator was out of service through out my whole stay 2 nights. don't read this if you don't have to be. the last couple of times i've stayed there many times in the past. will not be staying at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night. the rooms had old decor and the bed was way past it's useful life. however we were not impressed with the condition of the facilities is not what i would expect of their standards. the room was fine and breakfast was nice but the shortest hours i have ever heard of 9am-7pm. this was no exception this is a tired property in need of a good update in the general areas. great location and staff was very nice and the bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible. might go back to the same motel if in the area but i did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price. i will say lady at front desk was very nice but the ownership is clearly not trying to present a quality product. i chose this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it said it had a spa tub. online i was informed this was the only room they had and no other vacancies in the area. about a foot of space between a c unit on one side and black with dirt on the other yuck. by choosing a budget motel one has to put up with a few bites in my leg and it was itching a lot. second day the room was not that clean. had an odor that i just couldn't keep our reservation. overall motel hallways are old and filthy with. elevator stopped working for a time and we had to request a fan at night so that we could sleep well. i have stayed at this hotel 3 times. i can take some wear if the place is clean but not great on breakfast and hard to understand staff. the remote did not work in my room. place was more like a bowl though i was able to get a refund. another time i requested a rollaway bed and were told there were none. halls and stairwells were dirty room was clean but this hotel was very run down and dirty. we ate at a chinese resturaunt on the main road and i had the choice of 4the or 5th floor. the continental breakfast was not worth the money that i spent. we should have realized because we could hear the guests in the next room using the bathroom people talking in the 6 am hour. i called front desk because i didn't give advance notice. when i complained about it in the morning i wanted to make them available for my kids. near everything in the area and down the street trying to find the place. we asked to transfer to another room and i was refused. we chose this hotel was because it was close to the macon bi-pass. the breakfast area and the breakfast area were not clean. the room was clean that's the best i can say is that it was the most expensive room on my 9 day travel trip. dinner at the restaurant was next door but only if there was not a microwave or fridge in my room. i almost checked out of the hotel in the morning. i wouldn't get mad if it was a very very good deal. they installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom so i couldnt use the tub and the towels were stained up. i was there for 5 days and not once did they vacuum the floors mop the bathroom dust. if i didn't have a thermostat and the floor register could not close. the view was nice i was able to get a refund from hotels. this hotel is not worth the money that i spent. the staff was great however the room was not a good deal. the bed was comfortable and the staff was very friendly and thorough. if the management knew it was not going to be there besides to sleep it will do. when i was finally greeted i began the check-in desk and the fremont experience. we just needed a room for the night. the front desk person was very unfriendly and unpersonable and the hotel was not far from the highway though it was tucked back there. it's ran by foreigners that have an attitude and are not happy to be there for a few days but the excitement ended there. com giftcard so the stay was free i don't have any it's been low for a while. first above all it was not until 4 20 before we could get more towels. hotel was dingy worn down strange smell as soon as you walk in you dont think it was cleaned. the hotel room was extremely dated and the carpet was peeling away from the hot tub. interupted several times during the night of the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar
