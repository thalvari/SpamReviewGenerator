the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology. strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk. tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor. i really think the best character in the film by far. not as good as the 1st one except way worse. whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu. this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy. first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing. with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off. this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as fun as the first one. somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience. the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny. you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good. nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world. it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film. the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused. the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot. the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action. this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c. reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception. homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch. the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused. each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight. i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers. repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't. overall it was an ok movie at best. but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here. the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology. a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way. edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner. but this time was supposed to be in this story. the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city. the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse. the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received. eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks. probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor. to be honest i didn't really find that involving. it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead. although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs. the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill. the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology. and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable. it wasn't bad but not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2. more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date. despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie. iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now. the action isn't nearly as good as the first one. aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin. it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something. humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel. i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu. first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel. i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights. the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny. this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp. but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success. the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology. the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour. coulson's death was supposed to be in this story. the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film. that connection is a really heart-warming at some points. die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time. in the case of ant man and the wasp feels like marvel jr. not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste. the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused. for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative. this movie has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in. nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out. a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic. also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger. better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case. the movie has a lot of dumb messages. more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over. not normal everything works out in two minutes. the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk. decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well. in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie. this movie was a mess and i don't think it's a parallel universe. although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense. it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here. then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit. edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner. the directing wasn't what i was looking at. marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me. this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie. first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel. my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l. while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition. despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring. robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built. strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk. iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact. grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit. all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence. to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie. for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing. one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something. a lot better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great. a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers.
