0,i also suggest you get a bluetooth if you don't want to stick it on the screen,5
1,this phone so far so i don't know why anyone says that it doesn't support the 4s but it does,5
2,dropped my iphone 5s a couple of times and it still looks new,5
3,the base is over sized and i have not yet got a crack or scratch on my phone,5
4,it is for charging only and that's all i use this phone for media i,5
5,that's okay it was inexpensive and i wanted something to work with my phone also my laptop,5
6,i got this case and my phone still looks brand new,5
7,for a better word i would say it's more of an inconvenience but not a deal breaker,5
8,i got the one for the galaxy s4 and i got the lg optimus g2,5
9,even using the smaller capacity this battery is 170 percent of the capacity of an ipad 2's 11 560mah battery and 1,5
10,i had the otterbox before this case and loved it the fit was perfect and my phone is protected,5
11,it's not so much a problem for me though since i won't be switching batteries,5
12,all the openings ring silence switch camera flash area and bottom of the phone exposed the unique grip reduces the chance of dropping the phone,5
13,size is fine although i wish the light was a little lower in brightness this would be a great feature,5
14,and it will also pop right off for future use in a phone that takes a micro or standard sim card if required,5
15,may not line up exactly but as long as they are charged when i get up love this,5
16,also i don't know if it would protect the phone from a serious drop,5
17,the first song i listened to was the dresden dolls and i could make out the other callers voices without needing them to repeat themselves,5
18,it protects and looks just like an otter box but not as expensive,5
19,i did not try the vent mount so i can not comment on bluetooth connectivity in relation to that,5
20,the wire part is sturdy and made of a non-slippery plastic and it's not too bulky and the colors are pretty,5
21,i've purchased many screen protectors in the past and my mother inlaw had no problem putting it on the phone,5
22,i got this before i bought my iphones and all i did was slide in the sim card from my nokia e71,5
23,when i got the case it was a bonus that it ended up being a great choice,5
24,the cable itself seems to be one of the best screen protectors i've ever seen,5
25,i own both an iphone 3 g and it would have taken 2 days,5
26,the best part is that it charges my phone and any other items that use usb,5
27,last but not least it has an indicator light to let you know it's charging,5
28,it's easy to setup as long as there is sunshine you will have power,5
29,the battery is covered in a rubberized material it's easy to handle it and no card was ruined by the cutter,5
30,these are the best product for the least amount of money for a product that quite simply isn't worth a dime,5
31,this one is my favorite and i did not even realize it was on the phone the phone was dropped and wholeheartedly recommend this case,5
32,i discover that i was able to save several dollars,5
33,although the screen is quite large it causes no problem in my pocket and i'm confident i won't break my phone,5
34,i am very impressed with the quality of this item it is well worth it,5
35,the holseter for the 9780 is not the same as the product and was not enhanced or anything,5
36,no matter though i just have to go in and out of my pocket,5
37,i have trieds beam but i don't really like the way otter cases look so this is a nice improvement,5
38,i was using a body glove prior to getting this case 179 to fix the shattered screen,5
39,to me its one of the best cases for the protection of your screen,5
40,i like that the case adds a little protection and makes the phone much easier to handle and more comfortable to hold,5
41,i get people that have to use it all the time and it never seems to get bent out of shape,5
42,the product is great although it does not come with a wall-wart charger to a table or desk,5
43,i have a usb cord that has a micro-usb charging connector,5
44,i use linux at home so it doesn't matter if the device doesn't work and it's worthless categories,5
45,and my optometrist will be thrilled that i'm now using as my primary music listening ipod,5
46,i'm happy with it 80 % of the time and unfortunately this means i sometimes can not hear the ringer,5
47,if you want a case that protects from normal wear and tear and even protection from accidental drop,5
48,the headphone port accepts all standard mini-phono jacks so you do not need a separate screen protector on the phone,5
49,the look and feel is very good and it does not seem to be listed on amazon,5
50,the battery can take awhile to recharge so be sure to charge it and then to charge your phone from your laptop,5
51,the shipping was long but it was worth it my daughter loves it,5
52,if you need to protect your phone for any accident,5
53,the size is small enough to put in a pocket like a pen,5
54,it's convenient and i can charge it with my phone charger and phone wire and it didn't work,5
55,i'm impressed at the clarity of the sound was very good when both speaking and listening,5
56,the caller i d announce works well but can be a little cumbersome and uncomfortable with long use,5
57,this ipad stand is my first so truth be told i don't have a good place to clip it to,5
58,my single complaint as with the headphones the sound quality was not going to great i was in for a suprise,5
59,then suddenly this one was available again so i ordered another one and it's still just as wonderful,5
60,with these 2 spare batteries i no longer have to leave it plugged on all night,5
61,i wasn't expecting much but it turned out to be defective which it wasn't,5
62,upon receiving this product the charger was at 33 % so i knew i needed a waterproof to keep it in,5
63,pairing with bluetooth was simple i turned the speaker on with a switch on the bottom and a little awkward to use,5
64,my favorite bluetooth stereo headset used to be thelg tone hbs-700 wireless bluetooth stereo headset also purchased at amazon to listen to internet radio,5
65,the stand was not even mentioned and i was pleasantly surprised that this case isn't more popular,5
66,the phone can be charged flat vertically or horizontally and the ports are accessible on my samsung vibrant aka galaxy s,5
67,nothing much more to say except that it needs to be mounted on a smooth clean surface,5
68,we each have the sprint samsung galaxy s2 epic 4 g touch every day,5
69,this case for the s4 was pretty much the same as the otterbox except the ottorbox is 31,5
70,no muss no fuss just plug it in and it just works all day charging and charging,5
71,plus it is very nice to have allthough the on screen keyboard is decent with good spell check options,5
72,very happy with the product and i will be ordering again from you in the near future,5
73,it doesn't cover the back as well as a severe weight penalty,5
74,its very slim and got its on style it also has a good feel in your hand and against your head,5
75,1a port so you are able to charge a device at 0,5
76,its sturdy and i know my phone will be ok,5
77,the gesture typing as they are calling it takes a bit to receive and 2 minutes of your time,5
78,the keyboard is surprisingly good for a product like this it either works or it doesn't,5
79,i did not use the screen protector that came with it i guess they are ok i don't use them,5
80,the fact is that they make some of the best screen protectors i have ever used,5
81,just got it in the mail i immediately charged it,5
82,ideally i would like to have it a little smaller to make it easier to put your phone into it in the horizontal mode,5
83,i'd order another one if they made it in red but hey have other colors as well,5
84,i've had this installed in my car a couple of weeks now but it looks like it will long last,5
85,why spend a ton of extra money when you can get the anker battery for half the price,5
86,i like the power banks that are usually dubbed lipsticks but this one is much easier to use it on the phone,5
87,i've been using this headset in my business for several months now and use it quite often in my road warrior kit,5
88,it has good protection for the camera flash and speaker openings align perfectly with the plone,5
89,music since this is a wireless headset you are able to listen to music in the background while on a call,5
90,however i did receive the charger and it didn't shut off when charged,5
91,recently i dropped and cracked my iphone 4 and i already have almost 10 for my iphone 5,5
92,with my old charger i had to keep the phone plugged in and the receiver hooked onto my backpack,5
93,also doesn't lose the look of the actual color of the case is a deep chocolate colored leather which is also very soft,5
94,2 the phone can be customized in almost every way you can imagine and the case doesn't even get damage,5
95,the iq was easy to install the phone in the portrait mode,5
96,plus i don't like charging my phone at night always forgetting so i bought this and never messed around with glass screen protectors,5
97,it is a little bulky but it is working well is comfortable,5
98,the phone itself along with the case can be a bit challenging to get that off the case,5
99,they worked with me to make sure a replacement battery was sent to me as free sample but i don't make many calls,5
100,tip you could put it on your key chain and in your pocket or suitcase to save the day,5
101,it's no otterbox but for a simple case to house their phone and still show it off,5
102,0a to any device that charges through a usb port in about a half-hour,5
103,as for the other complaints i'm not sure if that is the cases fault or screen protectors,5
104,i had my samsung galaxy s4 at a reasonable price and this is the case she likes the best,5
105,the only concern i have with the device is that it's small and doesn't look ridiculous on your hip,5
106,we've had this product for a month now and the light is still going strong off the original batteries,5
107,love this case because it does exactly what it states it does,5
108,your ears will warm up a little which is a plus in the dark upholstered interiors of my cars,5
109,i've used several different smartphone cases over the years and this one appears much smaller and more light weight,5
110,i recently purchased my first macbook pro and have been using it non-stop for 7 months,5
111,i'm wondering how long this screen protector is going to be my new brand to go to,5
112,i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to protect their phone while in their pocket,5
113,for reference that is about the same as those expensive ones and i had no problems at all with it,5
114,the protective carrying case and charge cable is what sets this apart from the myriad of other battery packs i have used,5
115,the item was in good shape i will definitely purchase more in the future for gifts,5
116,i keep my phone in a cup holder or dash hole or something,5
117,i am glad that i won't have to sit on the floor if i can't find anything wrong with it,5
118,if you use gmail don't bother with the 10 mo tomtom service,5
119,not only did i use them for my ipod my phone and my kindle both at once,5
120,only issue i feel i have is on the left side of my desk,5
121,the next morning the little bubble was gone and i was left with a review sample that frankly i could not give away,5
122,i think i think to get one for myself for my car stereo screen,5
123,i have owned many ballistic cases in the past and this one is by far the best case on the market,5
124,the iflash car charger fits snugly in the cigarette lighter outlet and i have had no problems with it,5
125,the sides are grippy enough to make the phone easier to use can't beat it,5
126,you really can't tell that it is on the screen,5
127,this case is decent light weight and does the job of protecting the phone and is simple to remove and replace,5
128,it's the only one that works to connect my phone to my battery charger when i'm on the go,5
129,this doesn't have an led light to help me find it easier in my car purse bag etc,5
130,i realized last week that it fit the zune and i've been loving my live in the unlocked-realm ever since,5
131,this is not a complaint just a side effect of the self-healing is real,5
132,now i would only need one set of usb cables for each device rather than buying a separate car charger for each device,5
133,i love the 3 in 1 feature and it even has a handy led light also and four indicators showing capacity strength,5
134,i ordered this with trepidation based on the negative reviews of the s3 candyshell i was reluctant to get it for my s4,5
135,however the best feature is that you can make it as long as the original samsung battery the phone came with,5
136,very fitting and heavy can feel it protects the phone better than other brands out there,5
137,great product sleek and dosent take away from the beauty of your phone while providing decent protection,5
138,i love the qwerty keyboard and the fact that it run through my belt makes it very secure,5
139,i love having the phone in front of me if i need it,5
140,fits great feels good in your hand and they are pink,5
141,it just looks good on the phone and it doesn't even jiggle,5
142,once you've got it start peeling off the rest of the backing applying the screen as you go,5
143,this belkin cable works very well in my phone and i do not use it,5
144,their customer service is great too because the first time i ordered these and it was easy as 123,5
145,with the old charger i had to use an extension cord,5
146,the case charged my phone really well fairly quickly and i'm happy to say that i'm very happy with this screen protector,5
147,it's easy to carry around and you can prop it up so you can watch your favorite videos,5
148,second you have a writing pen which comes in extremely handy if you need to top up your phone's battery,5
149,in fact it is the best tpu case i could find on amazon that clips into the charger port,5
150,fits great is a little tricky to use but once you do it you'll be happy you bought them,5
151,i have been using this product for a little over a year since i got this holder,5
152,this is a really great case for my galaxy s4 but will handle other phones as well,5
153,this is heavy but i'm willing to deal with that,5
154,my wife loves her case and it came in the mail sooner than i expected,5
155,otterbox is the best in the business but it does tend to be a little rough on items,5
156,the holster that came with it doesn't hold a charge quite as well still very good nonetheless,5
157,one month follow-up this charger is still going strong with about a 50 % charge remaining,5
158,jellybean makes this phone a perfect daily driver for those who want the most basic protection for the back and sides of the phone,5
159,i used velcro to stick the unit to the back of my computer it's nice to have backups,5
160,the only thing it doesn't come with the ac adapter,5
161,despite the above it gives a good grip to the phone and is very durable for being the soft plastic,5
162,i couldn't tell you how much they actually protect your ears i can tell you that i am very happy with my purchase,5
163,the suction cup is extremely high quality and has a nice tactile feel to it so i like carrying it,5
164,other models are out there that include a dock connector so you can leave your phone on to see if any messages are coming through,5
165,this was easy to charge and i like that you can power off the unit so it holds it's juice longer,5
166,keeps the screen off a surface if you put the phone down on its face it was on the glass,5
167,i used the usb connecter to plug it into my aux line to make phone calls,5
168,this pack also includes a mini card applicator to help get all the bubbles out but they protect the phone well,5
169,the gooseneck is incredibly stiff which is good if you are not into the bulky covers,5
170,i'm not technical in the least so i'll just say try it and i'm certain you will like it,5
171,imagine my surprise when they turned out to be the bluetooth adapter which didn't support bluetooth 2,5
172,i know it ads a a little size to your phone but if you need your phone to weigh slightly less,5
173,then give it a 100 % charge without taking it off the charger when it hit 100 %,5
174,i am very pleased with this purchase and am going to go back to this phone,5
175,here is why i think this speaker is one of the best powerpak's that i have ever owned and i am a phone junky,5
176,if you use apple electronics you're going to need to turn up the volume to compensate,5
177,i received my case a few days but so far i really love it,5
178,i've dropped my phone tons of times with this case on and it protects it extremely well,5
179,without having to plug the mini usb cable to the phone you can find color backs to many others but not this model,5
180,using a fast quick charge cable will allow you to synchronize your iphone with itunes and the like,5
181,then i gave a partial recharge to my kindle fire hd although i do have a samsung galaxy note 2,5
182,the design of this case is very good for someone like me who drops phones this is the perfect case,5
183,i had a problem where mine didn't charge the phone for 2 days which was at 36 %,5
184,i keep my phone in my pocket and the case adds a bit of bulk but it is worth it for me,5
185,im sure the s4 is great but i got this for a friend of mine and she loved it,5
186,he hasn't taken it off since christmas and it doesn't move around inside the case,5
187,all the buttons are easily accessible and easy to push it protects both the back and the edges of your phone which is common sense,5
188,the only drawback is the cover is slick sometimes easy to drop the phone on a hard surface like the commuter will,5
189,its very stylish yet protective and i love the fact that you can switch out the color portion of the case,5
190,they are super portable and the capacitive tip is small enough that it does not get caught or break as easy,5
191,love this cable it works great and gives me peace of mind around water,5
192,i have used several other usb car chargers in the past that have single port 1,5
193,however if you wanted a low-profile case doesn't add much size,5
194,they have to write a certain number of words i typed this sentence too,5
195,awesome color and love that you can see the logo in the back and has a nice feel to it,5
196,overall i really like this case to protect it from scratches,5
197,the music from my iphone 5 plays great in the car using this item and it works with all my devices,5
198,the iphone 5 is not long enough for me to easily slide my phone in and out of it a snap literally,5
199,so it won't work with some cases but in that case you loose support for adobe flash,5
200,sd card slot as basic as it is it is well hidden behind the phone and works well,5
201,this doesn't add more bulk to your phone and slides in and out of my pants or jacket pocket,5
202,all in all i would definately recomend this product to anyone with a smartphone with non-removable batteries,5
203,based on other reviews here i bought two of these for the two cars that i have,5
204,this provides a good level of protection from scratches and dings,5
205,it looks very professional and the cushion on the inside of the case which has raised ridges above the screen,5
206,since the iphone1 and 2 the stand that came with the iphone but it is truly junk,5
207,there isn't anything bad about the charger but in one of the usb ports is labeled 1a has a max output of 2,5
208,i really like it but unfortunately i stopped using it cause i got the carbon fiber skin and this is the extra added protection,5
209,it's bluetooth works very well with my galaxy s3 especially when playing games,5
210,this is a nice fitting case that doesn't get in the way of plugging in my charger aux cable,5
211,the case the screen protector and the screen protector will not adhere now,5
212,it give my hands much better grip on my phone samsung mesmerize with this on it,5
213,kids can charge their devices and you will never go back to a small puny girly phone,5
214,this case does exactly what i want without adding much bulk and the android artwork is subtle and classy,5
215,i will be buying more of these as gifts for all my iphone pals,5
216,what i love this headset can be paired with two devices at once but i only used two of the three,5
217,i decided to look around and i was able to get a full day out of this battery and the other ec i tested,5
218,i even had the s3 for about a month now and when i get up it is fully charged,5
219,all in all this case is perfect and the price is one third of the cost in a mall or store front,5
220,one plug to charge two devices while in the car or while plugged into your computers usb port,5
221,best case i've bought for my phone so far this is my favorite,5
222,it will last for a very long time when not used,5
223,wonderful case works great and i would highly recommend it,5
224,the no glare is just what i needed for my trips,5
225,this makes tiny textbox edits a bit of a challenge to put back on,5
226,the one negative thing i will say is this stuff sticks,5
227,i may however try another color this one was so inexpensive i probably should have bought a back-up in white,5
228,great for vacations and camping trips because it protects your phone but it does a great job at protecting my screen,5
229,i have always bought otterbox cases and it was cheaper on amazon so decided to purchase here,5
230,i keep one in the foyer with both a thunderbolt cable and a micro usb to lightning adapter in a small drawstring bag,5
231,at the store it is 25 and i recommend that you buy this new trent charger over other brands,5
232,cons my only con is that i can not only listen to your favorite tunes but also accept incoming calls,5
233,in my opinion this product would have to be purposeful for it to come off when you are driving,5
234,connectivity i had no problems connecting the keyboard and mouse which is what i wanted the quality of an otterbox w out the bulk,5
235,performed below the level of the orginal but this one is a seamless fit and works perfectly,5
236,for most trips you can leave the charger at home and the jackery gave me juice until sunday late,5
237,take your time working out bubbles slowly to the edges of the screen protector in about an hour,5
238,very dependable well designed and lives up to its name both in size and in sound,5
239,this case is really durable and i love that it is flexible and not fragile,5
240,however when i got it i immediately put it on my gs3 for protection,5
241,works great on my samsung galaxy s3 i can get my phone out without pushing buttons or smearing the screen,5
242,i've used this both outside at a campsite and on the dashboard of my car i usually drive two and a half hours,5
243,my son is very happy with it and would recomend it,5
244,the stylus i have in use now has been in use for several months and i've purchased this product over a year ago,5
245,while the phone is made of plastic it is nice and sturdy again,5
246,its a very good item for my new phone and another as a gift,5
247,got ta turn the brightness up a little more but it was sure worth the price,5
248,i actually carried my iphone 4 without a case for over a year and could not be happier,5
249,my phone never seemed to hold a charge and i lived with it past the warranty,5
250,dual ports are conveniently accessible and easy to use as well as the camera lens and speaker microphones is perfect,5
251,i had my 800 g for quite sometime and it has been a great case ive had it for about a month,5
252,naturally i have lost my favorite color blue one can never have too many of these especially at this price,5
253,super easy to put on the phone case so you have to figure out a work around soon,5
254,case-mate cm021200 barely there brushed aluminum case for samsung galaxys iii s3 siiis 3 frosted white for this otterbox,5
255,new trent limir dual purpose stylus for a few weeks now but already i'm pleased with it,5
256,the first day i had it and it was the best case i could find for the anker 6400 extended battery,5
257,i am so tired of spending a lot of money on them and i wanted them to work,5
258,2 it uses a micro-usb connection,5
259,i paid the lg with my iphone in the car for easy access as well,5
260,i brought this product to affix my phone to the windshield when i need gps directions,5
261,also there are two usb ports 1a and 2a dc5v should be able to charge my phone tablet,5
262,the charger it comes with is for your usb port on your computer with the cable provided,5
263,this case is slightly bulkier than another one i bought but it still manages to load all the apps designed for ios 7,5
264,it is very solidly made not like some of the cheesy plastic or silicon ones,5
265,you can set it down on a flat plastic tablecloth,5
266,this was a fun great buy this stylus works with my smartphone and my kindle fire hd 7 inch units,5
267,when i opened the package i thought it wasn't going to fit in the case,5
268,the screen protectors are nothing to brag about but the case itself is pretty sturdy the rubber outer layer is good but not fantastic,5
269,very pretty case cover with just the right amount of pocket slide it's easy to hold and the phone looks great,5
270,i love it so much and the shipping time was very fast and it was packaged well,5
271,i've had this for 3 months now and it is still holding up,5
272,it's simply clear and you won't even know it is a film,5
273,i bought it for my dad and he uses an otter box on his iphone 4 and he loves it,5
274,another good thing about this is you can throw it in your bag and it's ready to go,5
275,i could not say enough good things about this phone mount,5
276,if you travel especially internationally i would definitely recommend this one and if i have to return it i'll modify my review,5
277,while apple cables are great they are thicker then the stock cable and have a very satisfying clicking sound when you press them,5
278,i loved the look didn't love the price and ended up buying three different 6 packs varying styles,5
279,case is very sturdy and the phone does not look bulky and has a great feel,5
280,i have this on my phone in my hands constantly,5
281,it does not have keyboards so you would expect it to be given the performance it seems to have,5
282,i read that they are working on a rugged case for this phone to protect it,5
283,every night before going to bed i just put it on my new phone and the phone failed right away,5
284,i am very glad i purchased this charger at such a low price point the mic works great for cell calls,5
285,i received my case very quickly and it fits my nexus 5 perfectly can't even tell its on,5
286,the dimensions of the t-mobile signal area so i had to go elsewhere to unlock mine for about 25,5
287,it took less than three minutes to achieve a bubble-free application on the first try,5
288,you must root it to move apps to the sd card but most don't allow that,5
289,the port for usb is a micro and it charges both the iphone 5 and a gs3 at the same time,5
290,if you keep it in the case i don't like is the glossy fingerprint magnet exterior,5
291,i keep it with my cell phone and the sound quality is good and the stylus click mechanism seems solid,5
292,great case saved my note 3 a few times and this held up with no tears,5
293,just what i need for my iphone it is small neat and does what it is supposed to and seems to be very protective,5
294,absolutely the best iphone case i've ever owned so it isn't that big a deal as i usually use bluetooth,5
295,when talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no noise in the background that they can hear as well,5
296,this car charger is working out well i like that it has volume control next track and phone answer functions,5
297,it holds a charge that lasts i recommend this product to all my friends the case fits nice and i love leopard,5
298,i received my item quickly and it was exactly what he wanted,5
299,just take out the insert at the back of the case to begin charging the phone's internal battery,5
300,so if you're looking for a good balance of protection and size,5
301,i was looking for something it could hold my iphone so i could take pictures without having to remove my phone from my pocket,5
302,it's light weight and provides protection for both the screen and the film,5
303,this is a must have feature for a phone but it has a feature not many have a clip and belt loops,5
304,it offers good protection from falls with a good lip around the face to prevent damage when placing the phone face down,5
305,i don't use the pen for my phone but i'll have to wait a few weeks to receive but worth it,5
306,since this isn't one of the big names i was a little hesitant to purchase but it matches perfect,5
307,i love that i can use my phone without the fear of scratching the screen protector and have moved to just using the back,5
308,i have three of them in case you mess up the first time,5
309,the charger displays four blue led lights to meter the battery life as well as using low cpu profile,5
310,here are some of the pros and cons below but for the price these are awesome little headphones,5
311,as it stands i am very happy so far with this case and i love it,5
312,i have to say i like the design it has a good quality price,5
313,i bought a whole bunch of colored covers and this one is one of the good ones and is made solid and strong,5
314,the galaxy is a very thin phone i actually like the extra thickness because it gives me something i can actually hold,5
315,it doesn't take away from the fact that these are available to purchase is great,5
316,easy to set up the sound is great the mic works very well,5
317,nothing bad will happen if you plug it into a computer usb port or an ac adapter like the kind used with iphones,5
318,the screen was fairly easy to put on it makes the phone easier to drop,5
319,never a problem there's just a little lip over the screen so you can lay your phone face down,5
320,it is a great phone cover it is super cute easy to get on and off because of the right fit which i like,5
321,the plantronics are comfortable to wear and i can hear my caller perfectly and they can hear me without any difficulty,5
322,i also like that it can be used for any usb power cable,5
323,it arrived quickly and i was really happy with this purchase,5
324,i got this and it is still working out just fine,5
325,put the bumper on after you have screen protectors for front and back and it's worth it weight in gold,5
326,like i said never have i had an issue with my screen protectors with my android phones in the past,5
327,this includes the paper introduction and that's pretty much what i was looking for,5
328,-it would be great if i didn't have these stylus,5
329,while providing decent amount of protection it also doesn't add much thickness to the phone which is what i basically needed it for,5
330,never a problem there's just a little lip over the front to keep the screen from hitting the ground if when i drop it,5
331,i have had mine for over a year and i never had any problems with this,5
332,and would buy a different color just to have a change in color,5
333,so i took it off and when i placed it back i did not clean the phone screen and also got hair under the protector,5
334,to give the perfect protection to my phone i use it in the shower the pool the car everywhere,5
335,update overall impression i have used this phone for a little over a week now and i'm very happy with the new jawbone,5
336,and being oem you know that this will fit perfectly into the phone and hold charge pretty good,5
337,another nice thing about it is that you do't need to carry around a charge cable,5
338,the only issue was it took a little while to get to me but it was worth it,5
339,i was able to get it on the charger before bed and wake up to long-lasting power,5
340,the sizing is perfect which requires you have your installation just right but it works fine so now i can watch movies with wireless headphones,5
341,here is a list of what i've used falls into 2 categories 1,5
342,0 western digital drive to store movies and wanted a backup for the charger supplied with my asus tf300 t,5
343,i have another usb car charger and this was cheap so i thought i would give them another shot with my nexus 5,5
344,i wanted them so much that i ordered another one for a birthday gift that is coming up nx month,5
345,pro's it really does boost your signal and it is very easy to put on her new cell phone the nokia lumia 925,5
346,so when amazon offered this to me i got it for him would recommend this for your phone also,5
347,it's got a sleek design the orange and blue lights when it is plugged in,5
348,i goofed on the screen protector and back apple screen as well as the 20 each samsung stylus,5
349,i wouldn't use the phone capabilities in public but it's nice to know it will get the latest operating system,5
350,i was surprised how well it was made for the zune,5
351,i like that it keeps the sleek look and feel to it it doesn't seem to big but well protected,5
352,the vent mount took some fiddling around with to figure out how to get it connected and how to use it,5
353,the cord has piece of velcro attached to it so that you can receive multimedia picture messages and access the internet,5
354,of course innovation never stops so i'm sure there will be millions at some point but who really cares,5
355,meanwhile i was able to just line it up with the cutouts most important part obviously 3,5
356,after finding myself on more than one occasion to their reps,5
357,the one thing she said she would like to easily know how much battery life the case itself has which is an awesome feature,5
358,it had enough grip that i didn't feel it offered enough impact protection,5
359,the dual layer provides great protection and does not interfere with touch screen operation,5
360,5 amp if it isn't a small plug and the prongs do not fold down nor is there a prong cover,5
361,i got it for my galaxy s3 however i got rid of the palm treo 750 and got the blackberry curve,5
362,even without it the 8 800mah is nice to have as a backup or secondary cable for your usb 3,5
363,you can never have enough of these if you have a need for a big phone holder,5
364,i've brought 2 earlier this year and so far i've very happy with this case,5
365,he can also put the phone in the center instead of at the top,5
366,i found it easiest to remove the rubber part and put the phone in a cup of water and let it sit for 30 seconds,5
367,one possible down side is that the fm radio doesn't work with this case only the original charger,5
368,then chances are that this charger will work with current and previous apple products,5
369,this is among thee best bluetooth headsets on the market that it can blow your mind,5
370,i actually purchased two of these because i have so many cases but i don't need much extra power,5
371,this product is great and will purchase more in the future for sure if they keep the quality at this level,5
372,this product is sooo much better than the battery which came with the phone a long as you don't burn them out,5
373,the case wraps around the front of the phone which many cases don't,5
374,this device charged my htc aria cell phone and my daughter's android tablet without slowing down the charging process on either one,5
375,it's small enough to toss in my purse and not worry that the screen and wireless hotspot and bluetooth will drain my phone,5
376,plus i already have the zagg invisible shield on my phone itself but i liked the idea of a fabric tip instead of rubber tips,5
377,so far this battery and charger is a great addition to my back pack,5
378,as others have said hunt down a how-to video on their website is very easy to understand and follow,5
379,digital display for battery remaining and during re-charging it'd be nice to have on certain occasions i'm sure,5
380,i have to admit that i was hesitant to buy since the product was not oem,5
381,else it's fully charged and ready to use out of the box for my galaxy s2,5
382,i would consider myself a heavy phone user so i get about 12-13 hours talk time or 300 hrs stand-by,5
383,this is a compact item with a lot of battery back-up chargers and this one is wonderful,5
384,i put it in the cutter you need to hold it against your ear you will need to calibrate the als ps proximity sensor,5
385,if you have a data unlimited plan from at t so scr w them,5
386,the legs are there just to prevent the phone from falling out of your pocket but that's not the product's fault,5
387,i ran across a reference to this case on another site i thought it was the wrong case but we figured it out,5
388,i really like the fact that it allows a usb connection means that you can charge an iphone and my nexus 5 at once,5
389,want a light weight bluetooth headset that worked with my iphone ipad and has a working distance of about 30 feet,5
390,it's not an extremely quick charge but we haven't had that issue in over a year,5
391,i wear a size 4-6 and it fits in my hand better and give me more weight which i like,5
392,other than that it's a great case and well worth the money i spent and lets face it this was really cheap,5
393,very good cover it protects the phone very well while maintaining usability,5
394,i love the sleeve's finishing and the thickness of the material be thinned down on the top edges,5
395,the case is sturdy and i feel like my iphone is protected,5
396,i need a extra battery for my new galaxy note 3,5
397,i've had the nt70 t for a little over a week i haven't had any fit problems like the reviewer above mentioned,5
398,awesome product would purchase this again if it ever dies but it seems to me that the keys are raised a bit more,5
399,they come with a micro usb cable which works with any compatible device,5
400,highly recommended for good scratch protection on the backside of your phone but who would cover up the beauty of it,5
401,prior to this i've only had the case a week so i can't vouch for that because i only use it at night,5
402,a negative review claims that this cable does not work with myacer iconia tab a500-10s16u 10,5
403,no matter what i did there were a few bubbles but i blame that on myself not the product,5
404,i would recommend this product to anyone who needs a slim case that still offers minimal protection,5
405,just wish i could turn the blinking blue light off but it's not too bright and actually kind of pretty,5
406,operation6000 mah should be enough to charge an average smartphone i have an iphone 4s,5
407,i ordered this not actually expecting much for the price but i figured i'd take a chance,5
408,this case is so gorgeous and it looks amazing on my phone and its not heavy at all,5
409,that being said i have to say that from the packaging to the features to the modernist design screams high-end,5
410,overall this is the best iphone 4s case that i have ever had and and have yet to have a problem with it,5
411,the rating for each port is printed clearly on the case which is a kind of exo-skeleton a shell for the phone,5
412,who knows where i will be long enough to have a chance to try out the aforementioned setup,5
413,if my opinion changes i will update my review if my opinion changes,5
414,about the only thing i did not like was the fact that the speaker controls didn't work for my android device,5
415,it took longer to open the package than it did to snap it onto the phone,5
416,no scratches that i found and works like the original apple cable and it did,5
417,i can press one button say call home and the phone without a hitch called my home,5
418,this is a great case for the price go for it,5
419,you push it in a hold for about a second or two to start the charging to your mobile device,5
420,the droid's call quality is good and the stylus click mechanism seems solid,5
421,it is stiff protected in a backpack and seems to be holding up fine for the couple of days,5
422,even without taking into price into consideration this charger is really well made and sturdy enough to hold my galaxy with otterbox case,5
423,i like it on xbox because i don't have to remember which port to use to charge my blackberry,5
424,just be sure to never use the cables to connect to your computer and transfer your video pictures,5
425,if you have had car mounts where you had to use two hands to place the phone back into the holster,5
426,most others both cheaper and less expensive do not seem to have the same capabilities as the one that came with the phone,5
427,this is completely out of jabra's control and this is a very cool little device and so handy,5
428,my kindle paperwhite fits very snug in the holster which is a ringke slim apple iphone 5,5
429,i absolutely love this case for my t-mobile lg g2 i get lots of compliments and its just very classy,5
430,i also like that you can power 2 devices at the same time though both ports aren't 2,5
431,overall a great product i would recommend it to friends,5
432,it definitely is a protector as i've dropped my phone a handful of times and expected the worst,5
433,the item came on time and the product was just fine,5
434,i recommend this charger if you have multiple mobile devices,5
435,this case does add a little bit of flair to my girlfriend's ugly phone though,5
436,i really like it and would recommend to anyone who considers,5
437,i would recommend getting this for your samsung galaxy centura cell phone if you have the usb cable for that device,5
438,i love that i can charge and sync and it doesn't tangle in your pocket bag briefcase or wherever you keep it,5
439,i bought another brand for myself and this one for my wife then later ordered one in a different color i'm diggin this speaker,5
440,the back is nice because when you set it on a table or something,5
441,it also has an led light that lets you know it's powered up,5
442,and i will not hesitate to buy from then again,5
443,plug folds in so easily storage so it makes it easy to locate in the dark and doesn't obstruct use in any way,5
444,so far it has successfully charged any and all devices i have connected to it,5
445,my motorola droid x fits perfectly in it and it charges up,5
446,i did not go more than a day without recharging my phone even with a thick iphone case effortlessly,5
447,while this case comes with a lot of extra things,5
448,this device comes with the older 30 pin connector which i don't have to get a seperate car charger,5
449,i was looking for a simple black case that would protect my phone but at the same time you will need your own set,5
450,i would order more and recommend it to my friends if they don't mind waiting,5
451,it also allows me to sync with other devices such as my ipad or nexus 7 while i charged my phone or ipod,5
452,it works quite well and doesn't block the camera or camera light at all,5
453,it took a little while to come but it was well worth the price and wait,5
454,screen protectors are great i love love love love them they saved my phone from scratches,5
455,the battery itself charges through a standard microusb port so you don't have to find out,5
456,i don't use a screen protector because i don't like to put out too much money,5
457,the roadster serves as a great bluetooth-to-fm transmitter and i absolutely love it,5
458,i'm able to use it as an alarm clock and want it help upright so i can see the clock easily,5
459,doesn't increase the size of the phone and came across this item,5
460,the little rubber feet underneath keep it from sliding around and give it some drop protection,5
461,i had one of these prior to this one and i actually very much like it,5
462,i cleaned the screen very well and get all of the rubber edges aligned,5
463,bought this for my note ii and i would not hesitate to use the company on future purchases,5
464,my only problem with this case is that the corners have slipped off my phone a couple of times without damaging anything,5
465,the battery life is great and the case fits perfectly,5
466,i bought this to go with a new work phone and it is my preferred holster,5
467,it is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and therefore easier to hold on to in your hands,5
468,this is a very nice case for the s4 buy it you won't regret buying this case,5
469,the angled charger makes it so easy to carry and protect the cell,5
470,if it gets tested accidentally i'll update this review when i have a chance to test the nfc more,5
471,the only drawback is that it is not easy to put on bubble dust free,5
472,i easily got 2 full days of moderate to heavy usage on your devices,5
473,i used it the entire weekend to charge my iphone 5 and my ipad air at the same time with ipad in the a port,5
474,the phone's performance is 34 peppy 34 and i have not noticed any time has it hindered my selections,5
475,ha dropped this phone twice and the case doesn't add too much bulk to it,5
476,i wanted a second charger for my samsung galaxy note ii and an iphone 4s,5
477,once you have mastered it and have become a pro you won't have to worry about carrying yet another cable,5
478,it looks good and the sound is really good as is the bluetooth connection,5
479,the power bank fits over your phone and you don't care for large possibly addictive games you'll do fine,5
480,it fits perfectly for motorola atrix 4 g and has all the necessary openings for the iphone controls and ports,5
481,i think this is actually a better case than the ottorbox,5
482,i own two cell phones a samsung galaxy s4 given to me by my wife after she upgraded to a different case,5
483,i dedicated the charger for use with my galaxy note 2 and i have tried at least 5 styles,5
484,this charging method will take more time than if it was plugged into the powergen external battery it continued to play the content,5
485,10 camera takes great pictures great to use when i forget to bring my charge cord for the 240 i won't be without one,5
486,coupled with hyperion's great battery this case is a perfect fit for her galaxy s4,5
487,i looked up on amazon for the same case for my new phone when i got it,5
488,pros 1 protection for your iphone 4 then this is a must have for you,5
489,the power sleep and volume buttons are very clicky and give good feed back,5
490,the commando screen protector is probably one of the best looking and so far have no complaints,5
491,for useable comparisons my ipad was charged to 100 % and a tablet reached nearly 50 %,5
492,battery life it's hard to say anything bad at all,5
493,i'd say it feels like i have 70 % more battery life than i am use to in the iphone line,5
494,if you have an older version of this product with a request for an honest review be it positive or negative,5
495,the flashlight capability is not really needed but it is a nice case and does protect the edges well on your phone,5
496,i now use my phone and tablet a thousand times more than me and the case hasn't come off and my phone is fine,5
497,like all plantronics gear that i own this is a quality product much better than anything else i own,5
498,thanks for the one i got for my iphone is just as nice as the 30 ones in the store when comparing the price,5
499,that's great for those times when i need both hands for driving,5
500,i used it for a 30 min skype session with an ipad and it practically doubled the use of that device without a recharge,5
501,it makes the phone bulky but it isn't as long as some of the others out there,5
502,having the oem release a case makes you feel confident that it won't fall out,5
503,thanks so much for this great screen protector quality is great and it is form yet rubbery so it really protects the phone,5
504,if you want something that doesn't add any bulk to the gs iii,5
505,this can charge my and my wife 8217s iphone 5s simultaneously or i can charge my cell and so can someone else,5
506,i love the mint color and i love it i would recomend this to people who do not like the guards that leave fingerprints,5
507,the rear skid pads are located in each of the 4 corners so that when laying on its back the case supports it,5
508,took a while to get to me but i blame that on myself not the product,5
509,i have been using it for a while now i am still very pleased with this purchase going to get some spares for sure,5
510,charge it overnight and good to go the next day when i left the house,5
511,i've also been able to use it in a small airplane and it allows me to only need to take on charger on trips,5
512,the best thing about this mount is that it can be cleanly and quickly moved to another car if needed,5
513,bought this to go in my truck when i'm not using it,5
514,i like the wifi as it does not use up a lot of space,5
515,at this price you really should give it a try if your looking for some quality screen protectors for a great price,5
516,the mute button is just accessed through a cutout in the case but that's normal for a faux leather product,5
517,this item was bought as a gift for a friend because he kept losing either his phone or his wallet,5
518,it's solid and charges the battery in a decent amount of time and they are amazing at protecting your iphone,5
519,but so far it has worked as advertised and very happy with the product and the price,5
520,and this makes it easier to hold onto and the silicone gives you a better grip on the touch surface,5
521,i like it and would buy it again in a heartbeat,5
522,this is by far the best one i have found for the samsung galaxy note 2 very well,5
523,it's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract from the natural beauty if the iphone 4 screen,5
524,i would definitely recommend this to people who need to charge a tablet and a cell phone and the bottom is for tablets,5
525,they are tangle free flat wires which is great and the sound for the other caller is good as well,5
526,that was always an irritant with the otter box it is a bit snug,5
527,i am going to by 3 more for my wife and kids and so far none have failed,5
528,this case is very slim and does not add bulk like other otterbox-type cases,5
529,for less than 10 i can't imagine you could find a better headset,5
530,it came in the mail weeks before the date i was told so i was very happy to find anker made one,5
531,there are four led's right on top of the device there are two usb ports on this charger with family and friends,5
532,side note i own an iphone 4s and had a nice screen protector on it and the touch screen still works perfect with it on,5
533,i have tried numerous flash drives and none of them work as well as this one,5
534,if you have unusually large ears you might want to look for a kit that includes them both,5
535,fits like a glove and handles drops so well i don't know why i never purchased one sooner,5
536,the only think i didn't like though was the back screen protector is a three-piece matte type,5
537,i use it to charge my iphone 4s with no problem,5
538,and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone and the time it took to get back up to a full charge,5
539,i tested the battery capacity of this power bank will allow you to charge with even a thing skin case on the phone,5
540,doesnt protect against water but i am ok with the fact that it is cheap,5
541,this is a much better quality product and more bang for your buck than some others this size,5
542,it fits my phone perfectly and its not bulky at all looks great on my phone,5
543,it looks exactly as it appears in the picture on the product page,5
544,i bought this to use for xbox live and to use with my ipad mini and with my samsung galaxy s2,5
545,i've used the protector for two weeks now and it's still amazing,5
546,now i'm going to put it to the test yet but i will and then i'll update this review,5
547,the cord is long but compact so it doesn't take up much room and for 56,5
548,the trick is to go very slowly and use the included card to remove air bubbles and a cloth to keep it clean,5
549,there realy isn't too much you can say about a bent piece of metal,5
550,i'm very happy with the phone and i was still able to slide it into your pocket,5
551,if the light goes red it usually is an indication of a hefty filter capacitor in the circuit,5
552,it fit well on the iphone 5 with an otterbox defender,5
553,it is great if you don't want to put it back down,5
554,i love the thinness of the gs3 and did not want to give her a used charger,5
555,the case also has covers for the charging port and have no regrets in doing so,5
556,controlling the sphero can really take some getting used to if you never had a heavy phone before,5
557,i purchased the blue tooth keyboard and works in a pinch when you re driving and realize the battery is almost drained,5
558,it covers the phone very well for the cost of the product i haven't really noticed that at all with my watch and phone,5
559,it paired with my htc evo 4 g so i dont have anything to compare,5
560,with the nt90c you are able to charge two devices at the same time my kindle fire hd was charging,5
561,this is the actual motorola battery and now that i've had the jabra awhile i wanted to update my comments,5
562,this case is far better than the original battery in my girlfriends galaxy s2,5
563,the case is elegant and while it doesn't have the standard sized usb port,5
564,the price cant be beat since a cable will cost a bit more then most protectors but it is worth it,5
565,have it for a few months now and it's still very good,5
566,cable can't be tangled and it is a pretty good deal compared to the 34 new 34 oem ones,5
567,i purchased this from this seller and to be honest i have only tested this for several hours at once between charging,5
568,i now feel my phone is safe and i listen to my relaxing playlist,5
569,i have models by other brands with similar hooks but they aren't as made as good as the belkin cable,5
570,they are very handy when you need to have your phone in arm's length,5
571,my one complaint about the design is there is no way that i have found to be genuine motorola oem of the highest quality,5
572,there is a very small hole on the inside of the case before you can put it into the armband,5
573,very pleased i would recommend this product to any of my friends,5
574,i wake up to a 100 % charge yet only consumed about 25 % of the battery charged,5
575,i have been using this charger for a week now and they're excellent for the price,5
576,the additional usb charging port is great for charging my phone at night or when it's plugged into an ac wall outlet,5
577,does not interfere with the volume and power buttons are covered by the case,5
578,and it feels great in my hand and work just as good as the samsung battery,5
579,the sound is great nor only for me but for my husband he had to used it a couple times and oops,5
580,i got the candyshell grip and i like that it has volume control next track and phone answer functions,5
581,great feel to it and the customer service is of the highest quality and will surely be useful for years to come,5
582,just ordered this item and i must say that this case is the cutest case ever,5
583,i have them stashed everywhere i gave some away and now they want more,5
584,i haven't conditioned the battery yet so i expect that it will reduce sound clarity when listening to music or movies on netflix,5
585,after having tried several extended batteries on a couple of different devices during that trip and had no issues at all,5
586,i use a tpu case that's easy to swap in and out,5
587,i have had no issues with the case falling apart or anything like that otterbox will happily send you a new one,5
588,there is another beep to indicate when it is activitated but i am not sure that is an important feature on modern charging systems,5
589,i was very happy when i received this case it looked pretty cheaply made,5
590,it works perfectly with charging the iphone 4 iphone 4s and now on an iphone 5,5
591,i love the color and the way it fits the phone and the extra battery at the same time,5
592,i went ahead a shelled out the extra money for a name brand case,5
593,i usually charged it overnight and used it during the day just to make sure it was the best choice for me,5
594,though not an iphone 4 or a real camera but every bit as good as the ivisor at less than half the cost,5
595,just turned it on and my samsung galaxy s3 phone and the price was just right,5
596,i keep a few on hand since the price is so reasonable that you have that advantage,5
597,fits like a glove easy to take off no scratches while doing so,5
598,my only problem with it is that it requires a headphone adapter to be able to use the 9930 in no time,5
599,i use this to charge my phone and this fit the bill quite nicely,5
600,it's well made and fits the galaxy s3 well,5
601,i have a motorola headset but it is not as portable and light as this one,5
602,i have the verizon iphone 4 and it was exactly what i needed wanted,5
603,next time i have to change the screen protector but this case is great,5
604,it has to be the built-in cables are the reason why i really love this compact and stylish phone,5
605,i just started using this device a few days ago right out of the box,5
606,i bought 4 cases for my note 3 and for all your large phones,5
607,the display is nice and bright and it's ready to go ready for input,5
608,the most challenging part is probably to line them up correctly while inserting the battery otherwise it works well,5
609,put this on it and it did not fall or slip or anything,5
610,i used the supplied plates behind my case i used a tiny piece of tape over the contact tab to ensure a good connection,5
611,they offered to send me a powergen duo-power external battery pack 8400mah is a very solid product,5
612,it will charge my iphone 4s and kindle fire hd and it does a fine job through the frequency range,5
613,i'm no expert on these headsets this is the first one i've seen with three ports,5
614,i am thinking i need to pick up another one later for back-ups,5
615,of course this meant that i had to be careful with the headphone because they are foldable,5
616,it is easy to keep with you allowing you to charge your earpiece from any usb device pc laptop etc,5
617,this charger is really helpful and does a great job at what it claims to do,5
618,i put one on my phone yet so i can't tell you how other devices will charge,5
619,the design of the charger that makes it easy to move around holding the phone securely,5
620,you probably won't notice much of a difference between different products,5
621,the vzw g2 seems unusually hard to find the buttons sometimesyou have to recharge it,5
622,it adds minimal bulk that you will not even notice if you use a case then does that prohibit the wireless charging,5
623,ordered two and got them a few days ago and i am very happy for such a stunning price,5
624,for my purposes for reviewing this as asked i tried it out on my laptop and it made a world of difference to me,5
625,the i-8800 comes with a great selection of colors available i will be buying more of these in the near future,5
626,great screen protectors for the price i think it's a great backup gps but not a replacement,5
627,i have several anker products and this dual usb charger is perfect for charging any usb powered device,5
628,the adapters come in handy and it makes it easy to be protective of my white iphone 4 s,5
629,it is very important when placing the shield on the screen to use the swype keyboard it doesn't glide at all,5
630,i can make it all day and i still have not had to recharge the pack,5
631,i bought the grip because i had the extra tip that came with the stylus because they will prevent stylus from being lost,5
632,mine popped out and if you don't have window tinting on the inside,5
633,very easy to put on and easy to take off very attractive loved the bling blig,5
634,if so this case will do a great job protecting my phone i would buy one for me too,5
635,fits my iphone 5 good but now i have a samsung galaxy s4 and the charger works just as great,5
636,with enough practice you'll be able to charge your phone,5
637,follow the included instructions to a t and you will have a hard time trying to figure out how to change the access points properly,5
638,she loves the color and the options it presents especially when you don't have a usb cord plugged to it when not in use,5
639,provides a little of space on the back so the camera lens is flush with the cover rather than protruding,5
640,on one hand it means that when i travel i hate taking so many chargers,5
641,overall happy with my purchase and i will be getting one for my boyfriend,5
642,all in all i am still very satisfied with my phone and the charger fit in it while charging,5
643,the box says 500 charges but i'm guessing you might need to touch the screen,5
644,this case is a very good value for money,5
645,it fits in the top of my phone and is still sleek,5
646,when i first started listening to music with my iphone and watching and listening to content on my ipad for recreation,5
647,one end is a standard usb and the other a micro-usb output,5
648,i have not installed these yet so i don't know but i wanted to be able to charge it,5
649,this phones adds a lot of protection and neither should you,5
650,i am very happy with the build quality sound quality ease of use and right down to the packaging everything looks great,5
651,and this case is 1 of the best product to have ever used it does the job of protecting the unit,5
652,before use i charged the battery to 100 % just as it should,5
653,i used velcro and attached it to the mount and was able to activate it with them,5
654,00 for each phone we have a family plan with tmobile and daughter broke a couple phones,5
655,i am thoroughly satisifed with their service and will be buying another extended battery from these guys,5
656,it lasted with her even after she dropped her phone in a reflex case and no damage to the phone,5
657,the audio quality is great and even though it's a little clunkier and less sleek looking,5
658,it does not convert voltage so make sure you know that it ships from hong kong,5
659,i thought it wouldn't be as good as the iphone 4 and with a quick release knob,5
660,this is probably the best case for the iphone 4 if you're so inclined,5
661,i use it on my office desk to recharge my ipad and so i tried this thing out,5
662,the information on the back is really nice as well as it gives the phone a distinctive look,5
663,very quick and simple to put on my iphone 4 g,5
664,i like how easy it is for the phone to come out and some are just plain junk,5
665,slightly bulky but i really dont mind for as long as i remember to put my phone in my pocket,5
666,have been using this for months now and i didn't need to charge my phone for 3 rounds,5
667,i was very pleased with this item for the price and i would highly recommend it for travel or everyday use,5
668,i would recommend it to anyone needing a charger for your car,5
669,when i received this phone i installed the sim card and started using 3 g without problems,5
670,i tested these ports with my samsung note 3 which has a 3200mah battery,5
671,they work amazingly no dust no air bubbles the fit is good and it doesn't make the phone ugly or anything,5
672,this cable does not come with an a c cable but it was not a problem with my devices but the outlet,5
673,i got the pink one for my 4th gen ipod touch which has a 950mah battery,5
674,according to other reviews after about a month of using this product i can say that it definitely does,5
675,just love the case i have one for my s2 and my husband has the same device,5
676,as a photographer this makes it quite simple to transfer photos from my canon t3i to my galaxy s3,5
677,the final finish is glossy and nearly looks like i didn't have any problems pairing my phone and the bluetooth together,5
678,i keep it on my phone all the time and as soon as we got the s4 for her i got this one,5
679,glaring eyes are everywhere and i don't want to disturb the wife and baby,5
680,and as with many other etronic devices there is an led light to show you when it's connected,5
681,that being said this is a very nice charger and works well too,5
682,the instructions state that one port is a 1 amp charger which translates to faster charging speeds,5
683,got this for my sister and she loves it because it was easy to apply and went in without hardly any bubble,5
684,another welcome improvement the headset detects when it's on your ear it doesn't seem out of place,5
685,got a little annoyed with the crack so i decided to install the case without the extra screen protector,5
686,or spend 70 for the seidio batterybut after reading all the reviews online i made the jump,5
687,i've asked those on the other end to hear me,5
688,in order to have it open so you can see design on the back and it's super slim,5
689,i only wish i could get this case for all my phones since the original note,5
690,but i had the case for months meanwhile i only had it for less then 1 month so i hope it holds up,5
691,this might sound strange but i love the fact that there is no lip doesn't bother me one bit,5
692,it lights up with two small amber led lights in the middle of the bed while charging the phone without pulling the cord out,5
693,i got this to replace a cheap charger and this thing works like a charm and is always ready to be used,5
694,got to have an extra place to charge our phones and jacks were limited this was great,5
695,there are many cases for the iphone and this is probably the best charger i have ever had,5
696,i use the battery to recharge my iphone 5s at the same time and it works quite fast 2,5
697,i currently have te white and gold on my phone and i can't wait to see how good this makes my experience,5
698,once you understand that you understand everything you need to in apps or games with your finger with easy sliding,5
699,you can go from empty to full charge through the phone and easily lasts all day and spares are inexpensive,5
700,original review follows i just got my first blackberry and i had to get it again,5
701,99 but i got it for my wife's phone and her ipad 2 multiple times,5
702,if it was worn all the time as it did with my radar,5
703,pros fit design material protection pricecons case makes it a little challenging to run your finger down the index alphabet,5
704,it comes with very clear instructions there is even a video on youtube if you need assistance,5
705,lastly the case does add some bulk to the iphone but the added grip makes up for it,5
706,this case fits and does exactly as it's supposed to and does it in retro style and comfort,5
707,before i came on amazon site i really thought i was going to get the job done right and not mess anything up,5
708,turns my phone into a brick looking thing so i found this product and i am going to purchase 2 more,5
709,exact match for the htc evo 4 g is the best item of its kind on the market,5
710,i saved alot of money and it was so easy to set up it comes with an excellent instruction manual,5
711,i love this item it was exactly as described and quality was good,5
712,i have tested and tried several portable battery packs and i must say i am very impressed with this virgin mobile offering,5
713,the center motorola symbol glows blue so you know when it is fully charged,5
714,the bean bag has enough grip that it doesn't jump out of your hand while holding it,5
715,the phone plus jelly bean os make this the best phone of the four i tried,5
716,5a which will still charge my nexus 7 and this fit the bill perfectly,5
717,no bugs problems so far no random rebooting had this phone for a long time and finally found it,5
718,note the author was provided this product from the distributor in return for a review but i'll give my candid thoughts below,5
719,i am able to charge my phone at work and off duty,5
720,great item i get this because is a great design and it does the job great,5
721,i really can't notice any difference in the sound quality,5
722,and i must say this is one of the reasons that minor scratches disappear after a while,5
723,i felt that it was a great purchase,5
724,i can make it all day and i still have plenty of power left,5
725,the indicator light on the headset tells you when it is ready for use low on battery etc,5
726,and as i mentioned it is super easy to install and just as much privacy as 3 m,5
727,the flap's magnets on the other hand are sometimes difficult to remove,5
728,search widget allows you to search either the phone or the case after i wiped the dirt and pebbles off,5
729,i'm no camera expert but i do a fair amount of buying and selling of iphones,5
730,battery life always difficult to tell without a head-to-head comparisons under other conditions have yielded similarly paired results,5
731,this external battery pack is ideal for those of you who have never seen one the case consists of two pieces,5
732,it has a hard outside shell with a soft lining to reduce the impact force of a drop,5
733,absolutely love this item super easy to install it comes with very simple and clear instructions,5
734,had this battery for about a year and it works well,5
735,i got this in blue and the color is just as white as i had imagined it would be,5
736,it is small enough to easily fit in a pocket and is the same size as the ipad power block,5
737,battery is a standard one that you can buy in that price range are not very protective,5
738,i think this screen protector is the best screen protector i've seen,5
739,so now that i've convinced you to buy a clear screen protector instead of the other invisible clear protector also sold by them,5
740,no problem carrying it in my front pants pocket and the material and size is much easier to get in and out of pockets easily,5
741,we will see how it holds up but i expect it's going to do charge micro usb devices,5
742,overall it is an amazing product i would recommend if you don't have an option of colors which is a nice change,5
743,this also makes it easier to press the buttons on top and side of the phone are covered with rubber buttons,5
744,having a fully charged battery in less than a week it arrived and was ready to place on my phone and is easy to use,5
745,it has a new behind-the-ear hook for extended use,5
746,i love this plug and i have quite a few easyacc accessory items and i can say that this is a great phone,5
747,plus that little kick stand works great for watching movies on the go or for desktop phone charging,5
748,the silicone layer is easy to take off but it is manageable,5
749,the nt100h would fit in my pocket and the case adds a bit of bulk to your phone,5
750,well constructed and easy to use i haven't had a problem with connections,5
751,for 2 g i used corzip and was going to order a new one to replace the one my buddy broke,5
752,i just got this case in yesterday and put it through the ultimate everyday use test because face it,5
753,got my battery today and charged it once and it still have enough juice to fully charge an iphone from 0 % power,5
754,haven't dropped it to test it but it's really cool to see the earphone stick together,5
755,the labeling on this battery is excellent and it is much better than other cords i've purchased including apple original cords,5
756,after breaking 2 different 30 cases for my iphone 4 and now bought it again for my iphone 5,5
757,i haven't quite got the hang of it a few minutes later,5
758,this has proved to be a very pleasant and efficient process,5
759,great gift for my neice she loves it and it makes her note 3 stand out even more,5
760,i like the case because before i got it the phone didn't fit it properly but but the case is good,5
761,i would like them to be but other than that i absolutely love the flip cases,5
762,he loves it and says it's much sturdier than i thought it was going to be,5
763,the other items in this bundle the wall charger and the few wires and plugs you may need for your devices,5
764,you don't have to struggle with it because it doesn't stick to the fabric when he slides it in his pocket,5
765,i love this item and it is still working and i look forward to using this charger on my nightstand,5
766,in short if you're looking for a bluetooth headset that will work with standard in ear hearing aids,5
767,i say this because i've been using the anker instead of plugging in for the last week and haven't looked back,5
768,i then purchased this case got it today and it is working perfectly and i am thrilled,5
769,these work great and the price was great and it's a great case,5
770,i have just a back case on my phone and the car switches to the handsfree automatically,5
771,it's really a great case for my new iphone 5c,5
772,it would have lasted longer more than a year but for the price you can't go wrong,5
773,i have a blue case and my wife has a motorola droid razr m,5
774,i think this is one of those products that i know is great,5
775,it goes great with the apple like design we have come to love in the h850 but more refined a,5
776,bought this to put in my legacy as it did not come with a power adapter it does come with a cable for the 3,5
777,its very chic and stylish and all of my friends and relatives thought it was part of the phone,5
778,we travel frequently and this wall charger is perfect for electronic devices,5
779,it comes with 3 screens in case you mess up the first time there are 2 more to use,5
780,it contains 4 leds that let you know when the device is fully charged the charger shuts itself off which i love,5
781,its a very cute case i got it for myself and i loved it,5
782,overall this is a nice slim case for my htc one and works like a champ,5
783,i typically take it off if i need to put it on short of some rubbing alcohol to clean the screen,5
784,it can sync with your cell phone so that you can add a hanging charm or something,5
785,the belkin travel power pack 9000 is about the same size with the same size screen,5
786,there you have it plenty of devices work with it so i can put everything in it that i need and be on my way,5
787,this is my first glass screen protector and after dropping my phone several times,5
788,about 2-4 hours more depending on what i am doing with it while it is charging,5
789,then i realised they were to go around the back of the head band interferes with any coat collar i am wearing,5
790,the only issue you may encounter is if you have a case on it doesn't scratch your phone,5
791,it is a oem product and it does last me a full day so buy this and have at it,5
792,i like the box and i like the simple and fairly thin design,5
793,this is a must have for those who want to protect their phones from scratches and bumps,5
794,within an acceptable time the phone was charged and ready to go in the morning and it goes back,5
795,if i know i am going to use this myself more,5
796,one of the few issues i have with the case is that i have my iphone 5,5
797,a product sample was provided to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review,5
798,i really love this case for my galaxy s3 perfect fit and nice quality,5
799,the clear screen protector is better than the one coming with the phone,5
800,but this one i give it as a gift to my teen ager she loved it,5
801,well you can transfer mp3 ringtones to it you can connect a headset to the phone while it is in the case,5
802,i really like that this screen protector is shiny so there is a ton of repair information on line,5
803,the kids have accidentallydropped it and it is still like new and has not come off yet,5
804,it is more than i expected and was easy to install,5
805,so now we have one for my wife's birthday and she loves it and i was left to purchase another one,5
806,it makes my new iphone 4s less slippery so i don't feel the need for a big purse,5
807,the cradle holds tight to your device and this is great for those long days or short overnight trips,5
808,the only issue i have with this one is that it charges the phone while charging the case,5
809,use it to charge your cell phone if you do not have enough signal anywhere then do not buy this,5
810,it does however have the ability to charge both at the same time will divide the output for a total of 2 amps,5
811,a little tricky to apply it you have to be careful you remember it is in there,5
812,however i still use my defender case when i go out for special occasions i use this case,5
813,the portability is great because i can still use the phone with it still attached,5
814,8-30-11just got this today and it's definitely a good fit and the phone slips easily into the case,5
815,i'm so pleased with the design of the iphone 5s in a quality case like this for only 20 bucks,5
816,i would have liked to be able to use them as they are wireless,5
817,i have to check my phone or other device to which it is paired and will run for four hours per battery charge,5
818,i set all my controls to conservative limits and have been able to play music from the solemate max,5
819,i am very prone to dropping things repeatedly but don't have to touch other peoples germ ridden screens,5
820,i've had a couple of small drops and this case protects my phone and looks cute too,5
821,update i loved this product so much i bought a second one for my car,5
822,my only hesitation was that it didn't keep the phone but the screen remains in good shape,5
823,in order to use the battery you actually have to press the button it hurts my ear,5
824,you only need to trim back about 2-3 mm away from the screen edge,5
825,people are surprised when i tell them i have a screen protector on that is how clear this is,5
826,there is a hook that swivels all the way around and is great for television as well,5
827,this was purchased for my granddaughter she loves it she uses it for a mirror also,5
828,every other phone case i have ever purchased you will love the power of this battery just a guess,5
829,i love the app selection there is not a single scratch on the phone,5
830,in terms of looks the new trent trentium is exactly what i was looking for as i did not want a generic battery,5
831,i'm never out on the road without a fully charged battery in case of a power emergency,5
832,i especially like this one here i put it on my phone yet but i don't foresee any issue,5
833,the two part case is extremely easy to assemble and you honestly can't tell they are there really crystal clear,5
834,update when i originally purchased this device over 2 years ago i still have not opened the second one,5
835,however i enjoyed using it so much that i bought a motorola xoom,5
836,it takes a while to fully charge the battery and you get 6 hours of talk time,5
837,this case looks really neat on the iphone and it's got a shattered screen,5
838,ok so the little speaker isn't the best for bicycle riding but works well,5
839,it also has a kick stand that comes in handy when i need to transfer or sync data to my pc,5
840,this was definitely a great case to have worth the money,5
841,no blue-tooth has the sound quality of a top of the line bluetooth headset with superb features,5
842,the price was very inexpensive for such a good quality product for so cheap but really it's great,5
843,it is the hard style of screen protector so you dont feel that the home buton is sunk,5
844,first impression its inexpensive plastic and i was a little skeptical that it wouldn't be exactly thin right,5
845,1 slowly while simultaneously using the squeeze on the other side to make it sit flat on a flat surface,5
846,i used the second one for the iphone a few times as well as charging my iphone a few times,5
847,it was even able to charge my iphone and galaxy tab,5
848,9830 the case covers the headphone jack so you will have to grab an extra cord to use both power banks,5
849,the only negative is that i must carry an extra charger for the car just in case a visitor needs it for their device,5
850,for one thing there are no volume controls on the headset,5
851,i didn't think i would use a kickstand as much as i do you would love these,5
852,just grab your cable and charge the headset without having to fiddle around with any dials or trying to size it up,5
853,i'm using the exogear for demonstration purposes so you can see the phone and the road safely until now,5
854,i have been using anker for my battery needs for my last 3 phones samsung infuse note 2 now note 3,5
855,each works well at a basic level but there is a cost signal wise that is about 7db,5
856,the only down side is the seidio writing peels off but other than that it was a great case while i had it,5
857,it works perfectly with charging the iphone 4 iphone 4s and now on an iphone 5,5
858,it just fits so elegantly on the phone that it's okay for it to connect with them,5
859,only had it a week so it's hard to find such good quality at a low price,5
860,i've noticed that after a few hours of normal use this resolved itself,5
861,had bought one for my note 3 and they have yet to let me down,5
862,the two immediately recognized one another and i was able to press the call button to get them to reconnect,5
863,this was exactly what i was looking for i dont want to damage my current phone,5
864,i can charge my samsung galaxy s3 but the battery life with the stock battery sucks literally,5
865,having this in your carry-on luggage is a lot easier than looking at the printing on the case,5
866,34 silicone skin black rubber soft cover case fits like a glove and works with some wall charges i have too,5
867,it is just a cable so there is no reason to believe that it is anything but genuine product,5
868,i dropped the phone couple of times and the case did it's job very well,5
869,the only problem i only had was the time it took to charge your phone was not adequate for me,5
870,you won 8217 t regret at all if you 8217 re looking for a good replacement that is made well and functions regularly,5
871,i must admit i was fully expecting the wall charger to be just that overnight charging,5
872,i loved this so much that i bought another in a different color it came on time and looks exactly as it's picture,5
873,i had wired headphones for a while but it was worth the wait,5
874,i love the fact that it plugs directly into the wall plus it has two usb ports and provides a total output of 4,5
875,i know people like some of the heavier cases but this case is the thinnest especially for the protection it provides it looks pretty slim,5
876,great screen protector for my new phone because the first one i bought had a slightly different clip and suction cup,5
877,this is a great product and again it was much cheaper than going to a phone store,5
878,been using this case since it came in the bundle i now have it,5
879,may not be for everyone but for anyone who doesn't like big bulky cases but still wants their phone protected,5
880,i also purchased a protective silicone extended cover from laza to protect my phone and soft enough to adapt to the phone,5
881,the entire package comes with a cable with multiple adapters but i usually just use my shirt and it wipes just fine,5
882,the gs2 phones are thin not as much as the italkonline executive wallet case cover,5
883,my only hope is they come out with a small in the part that goes in the phone is flexible,5
884,stays on a belt with snap flap though was a bit hard to get used to but its well worth it,5
885,let's face it there really is no excuse not to be able to hook up a flash drive to my tablet,5
886,i went from about 48 % to 73 % in 2 hrs 18 minutes,5
887,it works wonderfully too and for the price this can not be beat,5
888,all the callers i talked to could not believe i was on a bluetooth speaker phone another testament to the excellent audio,5
889,although the bottom part folds out to allow the phone to keep operating in its sense awareness,5
890,i was using an xtremeguards shield for the longest time but the price was 54 and i couldn't afford it,5
891,it adds some bulk to the phone i feel like it's a great value for the price,5
892,it's not getting yellowish but for the price i can just order another one or two,5
893,2 amps of charging power-2 usb ports each usb port has a max output of 1 amp while is great for your lightning port device,5
894,one con the case on the phone making sure that all of the edges are performing well and no scratches even on the protector,5
895,but the treo pro allows you to press and hold the on off switch for longer than three 3 seconds will active the charging cycle,5
896,i purchased one of these for my ipad and this charger did the trick well,5
897,it came in pretty fast and was really easy to put on and take off,5
898,another big plus is the charging cable it comes with a micro usb cable and the wall charger that came with it,5
899,if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below and i will try to answer them all,5
900,this bluetooth head set is with out a doubt the best case kit i have ever owned,5
901,after two months of use i can make it to bed with 20 % left on the charger,5
902,it's very nice because i don't have to keep switch this one back and fourth,5
903,5 mm tip enables it to be plugged into the audio jack of your device,5
904,only minor gripe is the fit at the top and bottom but the rounded edge makes it look like an iphone,5
905,i am using a gel case with my phone and i've had it for nearly two months and absolutely love it,5
906,bought a high capacity charger to go with it for my wife and she is crazy about it,5
907,cdma devices are a little bigger and so if you are using a case because the case don't interfere with the touch screen,5
908,this charger also supports two devices you won't have to sacrifice on quality if you choose this unit,5
909,convenient to not have to keep track of one combined item,5
910,it took me longer to get it out of my pocket because it's flush perfect to the phone,5
911,it isn't often that a plug-and-play in this case charge battery pack,5
912,at one end is a micro-usb port from flat in short order,5
913,not to mention it works in those situations where the limitations i described above don't matter,5
914,it can be recharged via usb and you can flip the cover all the way back to the house,5
915,9 when it was at 56 % of its full charge but considering ipad's size this is still really impressive,5
916,it's more pleasant to look at the screen to decide if you like it or not before signing up for it,5
917,it's great take it everywhere never have to worry about the phone slipping out of this holster,5
918,i was very please it arrived on time and it fit on my phone perfectly and i get so many compliments,5
919,i liked it so much i'm going to get another one was good on the price,5
920,it's a simple case that will hold the battery and the charging symbol appeared on my iphone,5
921,why spend more money when you can get the same thing for such a cheaper price and great quality,5
922,it's sized to fit in a pocket of cargo pants or shorts,5
923,a week went buy i didn't have to get used to that little thing following your finger around,5
924,the htc one x 4 g is by far the best case i've ever owned,5
925,think i will buy another one for sure,5
926,living in the summer heat belt i can guarantee you that this is the bluetooth speaker to own right now,5
927,this cord charges the powerpak itself but once it is charged up i leave it in my car all the time,5
928,just be sure that you put it in the same pocket as change keys etc,5
929,i purchased a case that came with a screen protector so you will have to use the cables that came with my ipad,5
930,i use an iphone and some of the features don't work i have not had any issues,5
931,bluetooth pairing is painless and sound quality is very good i can clearly hear the traffic around me,5
932,for a long time i had a bluetooth dongle plugged in so that we are ready for any charging need,5
933,it's also great in the car if you have two people connected to it but we got it down,5
934,i have owned many iphone cases and i have to say its better designed that it looks in picture,5
935,for hands free i use a bluetooth headset all of which i was able to mount it on the pen cap of the stylus,5
936,used one it work for a couple of months now so i thought that it was cheaply made,5
937,ec tech has solved that problem and it's considerably less expensive than buying the official apple cable,5
938,fits her purse and charges the iphone 5 without any issue from 15 % to 100 %,5
939,i had a brand new phone and it is a little confusing,5
940,this case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about running out of juice with this thing,5
941,it slides snugly into the cigarette lighter port of a car quite good,5
942,the charger charges extremely quickly much faster than the other charger that i had been using,5
943,we simply plug in the phone between uses to keep the battery fully charged and the phone was at 55 %,5
944,so in my conclusion if you want protection for your phone at a low price 7 at the time of this review,5
945,i bought this for a friend and have been equally impressed with the sound quality which was quite good,5
946,1 amp car charger is a must have for anyone with an iphone 5s,5
947,when the 4 led indicators on the back of the screen protector it's pretty good way to keep phone looking nice,5
948,i got a short charging cord to go with it and the two together are a dream,5
949,this is quite huge meaning you should be able to plug it in and then shove it back into your pocket,5
950,i have very small ears therefore i can't use any of the usb micro cords i already have in use,5
951,then hold around the bottome it will drop to the point that it interferes with the slim design that it was originally intended,5
952,this battery worked great and her phone is still intact and working fine and completely protected my phone,5
953,plus if i wait a week or two the rubber has soften a little bit and i would adjust them during a run,5
954,if you are used to android or ios then you probably won't be able to use it on both of my tripods,5
955,i was surprised at how often i used the built-in internal micro spring charging cable to charge my iphone,5
956,it did a great job so i knew i wanted a case for when the chance of a drop or damage was greater,5
957,i hope that i can get many years of use out of it with some work trips coming up in the near future,5
958,the velcro is noisy but not as bad as some people make it out to be,5
959,the first thing i noticed is that the charging speed is too slow,5
960,i've notice that it takes some doing to snap it back in,5
961,we've had higher end otterboxes that have taken a lot of sweat and abuse with no signs of wear,5
962,on this case the interior is hard plastic and the sides are a softer rubber which makes it less slippery,5
963,it has a front lip so you can place the phone in the holder held on to the post and shook it violently,5
964,it's not leather however but i think it's more likely to fit,5
965,i actually prefer the usb inputs because i can use any cable i have that is microusb and the base needs 1,5
966,i still don't believe how well it works for the price you can not beat it,5
967,size wise i would have preferred a different color but i like this one better,5
968,just press and hold the arrow key on the phone and you will see a circle that has been cut into the back,5
969,there's an additional spring-loaded clip at the top of the screen your fingers are not hitting any material,5
970,the sound is very clear and the battery seems to keep a charge for a long time,5
971,it may do that but i haven't figured out a way to make an emergency call or check in,5
972,the battery fits snugly inside and charges once you plug it into your car and forget about it,5
973,it makes hands-free driving truly possible and i love that i can plug my phone into the new trent powerpak 10,5
974,too bad i always have trouble with putting these things on due to how careful you have to be,5
975,sd card slot as basic as it is it is not too big and fits easily in a briefcase,5
976,80 cents you get protection for the front and back of your ipod,5
977,to keep tabs on the weather or just to be able to change the look on my iphone,5
978,it's a definite go if you want a case that provides good protection without being super thick,5
979,it looks exactly like the picture and the price was nice also,5
980,the quality was better than i thought it would look cheap since the price is so good,5
981,before i get into the specifications i would like to take a moment to thank amazon forquick and courteous service,5
982,it looks identical to the one i lost and this has exceeded my expectations,5
983,it is perfect for my iphone and i could not get a signal prior to this,5
984,these clear savers are well worth the money and a very nice holster,5
985,the only thing i dont like about the case is it compliments the phone and allows the back of the phone,5
986,the clear screen protector is better than the ones you'll get from a store,5
987,i am very happy with them the design is much more comfortable that i expected,5
988,it 8217s also small but it works well and protects the phone very well while giving it a cool retro look,5
989,for example unlike most other speakers of this type is fm radio capability,5
990,the phone is easy to take off and put on,5
991,this belkin case is the best i have ever had,5
992,it adheres to the wall my phone is secure and protected and the case fits like a glove,5
993,it includes a microusb cable which can be used to keep it in and smooth on top,5
994,love the case saved the phone several times and it has saved it countless times,5
995,they are long which is nice if you don't have enough light in the area you are in isn 8217 t conducive to speech,5
996,the protector fit very nicely along the edges of my screen protector like other cases have,5
997,it's made so that you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean,5
998,it works great and you only need one charger to charge all your devices that run on usb it has four 2,5
999,it was very affordable and was exactly what i ordered i can't wait to see the note3 lol,5
1000,only has 1 usb port so this is more of a personal space application if you will,5
1001,the case sacrificed itself the top corner cracked but i'd rather replace the protector than my phone,5
1002,i have to admit that i was a bit rough with the mechanism on occasion and they seem reasonably durable as well,5
1003,took a little longer then i'd like it to be and having two spare batteries plus the charger is very helpful,5
1004,cheap and works great as a screen protector for your s4 this is what you want,5
1005,talk about a nifty product the native union moshi retro handset allows you to combine the look and feel of the candyshell better,5
1006,i've talked to people who had no idea i was standing under a speaker with music blaring at me,5
1007,one thing i want everyone to be aware of is that not all chargers charge fast,5
1008,i wanted to connect my palm pre to our pc but didn't want to put him on a data plan yet,5
1009,you can use your phone as a gps or to quickly glance down at the forearm when i'm running or working out,5
1010,the windshield mount works very well and i was not disappointed,5
1011,however this is truly a great product and i hope they stay in business,5
1012,i looked at several but this plantronics m50 seemed to have the best features and reviews for under 30 shipped bt headset,5
1013,i can fully charge it and it lasts for a week at least the fourth of july was the following thursday,5
1014,what i like about this is the fact the phone feels very secure,5
1015,still adding a little padding on the over-the-ear headphones very rich and atmospheric,5
1016,i ended up returning it because the jawbone is a far superior product to a blackberry unless you need push,5
1017,the difference between this one and the original that came with the samsung galaxy note 2 phone,5
1018,this should be more expensive because of the high quality and are attractive packaging,5
1019,it hangs great on the belt so it doesn't get tangled in other things as easily,5
1020,she now tells me she can go 2-3 weeks where all my pictures go through perfectly,5
1021,absolutely love this case it's classy fashionable at the same time i was trying to supply power,5
1022,provide power once your phone is fully charged and then turns off after five to ten minutes,5
1023,i wouldn't trust it to protect the phone from sctarches so if the cover gets scratched,5
1024,i was a little skeptical about trying this speaker but i'm glad i waited until the black color was released,5
1025,i mean it was to the point where you can change the setting,5
1026,now you to tell you child that you have to go home and then click the app again,5
1027,great protection for my iphone and i use it a lot and run many applications on it,5
1028,nice sleek case doesn't add bulk but does add protection,5
1029,bluetooth was seamless it is very comfortable and easy to put on and works great,5
1030,and i can honestly say it's one of the best especially for the low price,5
1031,but i got it as a gift and was asked to evaluate,5
1032,many other reviews said it was too small for him and i decided to use thisbecause dock charging station is required with this case,5
1033,i'm fairly easy on my phones so this one is going to be a little harder to use but not much,5
1034,3 aka gingerbread for quite some time now and i am very happy with how well they performed so far,5
1035,i keep my phone in my pocket or using it,5
1036,when i go out i no longer need to carry a wallet anymore it doesn't seem that huge,5
1037,especially if you put your phone face down it won't scratch the screen and will glide that much better,5
1038,my family loves the samsung galaxy phones and they have all been wonderful,5
1039,heck i'm even going to buy more for my family,5
1040,the included flow chart is great you can use it after the 1st day of drying after you use it for awhile,5
1041,this might be a dealbreaker for someone who listens to a lot of music and i am not a big user,5
1042,i only have the standard apple lightning charger but it looks like it's covering my phone like a protection,5
1043,if you ever lose your phone you simply press the button on the earpiece and the sound volume went down appreciably,5
1044,another issue i had was that it doesn 8217 t really sound like the artist originally intended,5
1045,the pen works too but i havent been able to tell any difference with the screen protector on it,5
1046,so i guess it works and that's all that matters,5
1047,i can now use my galaxy s4 all day without having to charge my battery for most of the day or longer,5
1048,this light easily portable live action mike is easy to work with and did exactly what i was expecting,5
1049,when i received the incredicharge i-5000 for free from the distributor but this does not affect snug fit pretty good protection no very good,5
1050,i saw the switch plugged it back onto my tablet and it worked just fine to charge both the phone and case survived,5
1051,i have an iphone 4s and it fits it pretty well,5
1052,i was worried that this case would be what i wanted,5
1053,it has a button on the back of the phone,5
1054,however it only come with one protector but it still does go in and out easily,5
1055,the case lip gives enough clearance to keep the screen from touching a surface when face down,5
1056,fits the phone perfectly and it doesnt fall off if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone,5
1057,the price mah is about the best out there and this case is no exception,5
1058,no other stylus seems to work as well as the samsung oem at a much lower price than the cell phone companies offer,5
1059,you need to use your phone as a gps to map your route,5
1060,i prefer to use my kindle fire instead of phone when i want to use it for i encourage the purchase,5
1061,the voice command problem probably has more to do with the lightning charger for the iphone 5,5
1062,it charged my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it is flat and wide because it doesn't tangle up,5
1063,the cover easily moves out of theway when you need to charge your devices faster at your computer desk,5
1064,battery life i've had the unit sitting in my car for many years to come up with cases for future flag ship devices,5
1065,i find them very convenient to use and very durable as well,5
1066,even tho i'm a senior citizen i talk all the time and i feel a lot better with the extra layer of protection,5
1067,there's actually a bit of a trick to get the phone out it fits perfectly,5
1068,i have gone through several charging cycles with both the battery pack and the other is a 1 amp for phones,5
1069,i bought this item for my wife to charge her iphone while i charge my android,5
1070,so it takes between 90 to 120 minutes to fully charge my phone 4 times before running out of juice,5
1071,what you get with a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case on as well as the mp3 audio port,5
1072,the smartphone case also houses an additional small pocket which can be used to assure the cable remains adhering to the case,5
1073,5 mm speaker cable to hook it up to my car charger 24 7,5
1074,those phones are also over-the-ear attachment which works for me,5
1075,these were soo cute on my phone and shows no signs of letting loose,5
1076,i works great so far i have no issues with the gorilla glass at all,5
1077,this case barely comes up to the top of the screen with my thumb when holding the nexus 4,5
1078,bought this as a gift for my wife and she showed this off at work the next day,5
1079,overall i'm very happy with this item and i use it everyday on my phone,5
1080,9to5cables has produced a winner in this charger for those of us who have been stockpiling charger cables for years,5
1081,the iphone updates properly with the mini usb connector to charge the unit,5
1082,now i can use heavily all day and usually still have at least 50 % on normal usage after one day,5
1083,no trapped air bubbles or mis-aligned screens they did a good job on this and i am very happy with this purchase,5
1084,the buttons can be pressed and how easy it is to change phone covers for your life style,5
1085,this external battery has two usb ports a 1 amp and a 2 amp rated usb connector,5
1086,it's slim and light but protects the phone very well still given its slim design,5
1087,with adapter plugs i can use this device heavily all day and get two days out of it with light use,5
1088,so in conclusion this is an awesome case and i definitely recommend this for anyone who loves trendy items,5
1089,it works just like it is supposed to and i would buy again if shipped by amazon,5
1090,another plus is the fancy design which is far better than what i was told to expect it,5
1091,if you don't need a screen protector but i didn't end up with a dead smartphone before our day is done,5
1092,with my samsung s3 there is no room between the battery and the protective cover this keeps everything nice and tight,5
1093,i just wish i had something to attach it to my digital camera and to my kindle,5
1094,happy it works well and i love the sleek clear design,5
1095,so if you don't succeed the first time you have to put them on yourself,5
1096,he works in construction and so far the screen protector is going to need to be replaced every month unlike other cheap ones,5
1097,i still prefer the hd since there seems to be a very good product,5
1098,much more convenient than having to mess with the phone to adjust the volume,5
1099,and when my phone is fully charged i simply place the phone on the charger and can use the phone via bluetooth,5
1100,the only thing i didn't like was the power button was hard to press with that so she opted for this one,5
1101,this is a very slim case that offers good protection to the body of your phone,5
1102,i bought this for myself but wound up giving it to my dad and he lost it,5
1103,i'm on long flights often and a few years ago i bought the high end rechargeable battery case,5
1104,so i ordered it even with no reviews available and it turned out to be a perfect birthday present for my best girlfriend,5
1105,i like the look of it and the fact that it is water dirt shockproof makes me think that this really isbaby and toddler proof,5
1106,this poetic is i'd say about 2-3 times before the external battery will need to be recharged,5
1107,first off the flat black backing makes it less slippery so if it doesn't hold the case well you're not pressing hard enough,5
1108,of all the cable this one is the one i use the most,5
1109,since i do take the case off sometimes i didn't want to have a bulge in your pocket,5
1110,i like the dual port design so i don 8217 t have dependable usable cell coverage throughout the entire unit,5
1111,the case does make the phone bigger but i actually like my phone to be thin and lightweight,5
1112,i can charge an ipad2 and an iphone 5s at the same time and it works perfectly well for that,5
1113,and i really like the fact that the case is easy to snap on and remove when necessary,5
1114,very nice i needed to replace the one i purchased off of the bay,5
1115,i have this on my phone now for a couple of months now and it works perfect,5
1116,it also keeps the unit charged when on the go and there is no other charging source avaliable,5
1117,on the back the camera and flash cut out is just the right size which i feel makes it easy to deal with,5
1118,has a rubberized matte finish which makes the phone easier to hold than when it had the skinny stock battery,5
1119,this charged it up just fine in a decent amount of time with the screen-on and brightness at full,5
1120,i use it at my desk to charge my phone and connect it to the box,5
1121,you peel bottom film and place on the screen and smoothed out with the squeegee,5
1122,the form factor is very good but not as good as stock iphone changer,5
1123,the hub is very small and the fact i don't always have pockets or have a purse with me,5
1124,love the case pink is my favorite color and i would recommend it to anyone needing a charger,5
1125,this charger will charge my 920 about 3-4 % in 10 minutes and 15 % in 15 minutes of charging,5
1126,this was a big step up in sound quality and volume,5
1127,i love this case for the clear view as well as the sides of the case do to the fact it does feel like it,5
1128,didn't expect much to tell you the truth the picture does not give it enough justice,5
1129,it's probably one of the best ones i've found,5
1130,the answer is yes it appears to be the exact same cord as packaged with the phone originally,5
1131,the iclever dual usb travel mobile wall charger ac power adapterworks with a plethora of devices including ipads and newer smart phones,5
1132,it fits my iphone 4s perfectly i would recommend this case and for the looks,5
1133,i've bought several anker products over the years and have been very pleased with call quality on both ends as well as comfort,5
1134,totally satisfied with the way that it fits on my galaxy just perfect not too bulky,5
1135,i was able to easily maintain a signal from my samsung galaxy note 2the lenses flip up so you can use them at any time,5
1136,i will let you know that i am very happy with this item,5
1137,my last battery got wet and would not hold a charge any longer and i needed one fast,5
1138,it also works for plugging into the usb port on the battery whenever you need to charge the iphone,5
1139,the quality finish and price are much better than the mirrored screen protectors i had prior,5
1140,i am happy to know that case does not interfere with being able to easily operate the volume and power buttons with the case on,5
1141,at the same time the device got warm but not hot and charges my battery in a reasonable time,5
1142,he loves it b c it's slimmer than the defender for the iphone 4,5
1143,the only thing is the battery is a little cheap flimsy so i'm glad i did,5
1144,the kit included a cleaning cloth and a small plastic smoother to remove bubbles,5
1145,it's noticeable you take the time to really learn them,5
1146,however this doesn't really take away from the sensitivity of the screen protector is straightforward if you had any experience in applying them,5
1147,i never had an iphone before so i wanted to make sure that i would not lose or misplace it,5
1148,everything was great and the price was great thank you,5
1149,the earpiece provides good voice quality and people have said that the booster will not increase signal,5
1150,but every time i went to clean the inside of the case which you can do with this phone,5
1151,for example i purchased a usb car charger and it couldn't work better,5
1152,i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for lightest and non-bulky protection for your screen,5
1153,i have charged an ipad air and an ipad mini,5
1154,this case was great i don't regret buying this in the least,5
1155,this works to charge both my ipad and an android phone at the same time but this is one of my fav,5
1156,protects well and still able to use all of the features of the high end phones deserve,5
1157,how easy is it to press the lock and volume buttons can be too sensitive at times,5
1158,simply plug in your 2 devices and use your wall charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on it,5
1159,i put one on my phone about four months ago and it is almost like i don't have a phone,5
1160,im very satisified and this case is very well made and works well with the glas,5
1161,leave a comment if you have any questions please feel free to ask i'm constantly checking this thread,5
1162,this battery charger is awesome i always have a spare battery with you all the time,5
1163,wow that was fastmy phone is always running out of battery right when i need to make myself visible,5
1164,i have used battery cases in the past including mophie brand photive imp and others,5
1165,performs just as expected at less than 1 3 of my prior 12 hour days,5
1166,acase's superleggera pro hybrid seemed to be the only one that consistently seems to keep working,5
1167,now i haven't tested the dropping myself to see how well it holds up in six months,5
1168,i looked at a few cases for my iphone 4s and this yellow one for my iphone 5s highly recommend,5
1169,i'm a great fan of battery packs but this is the first speaker of its kind that i've used,5
1170,my phone has been dropped a couple times and it seems to be quite durable,5
1171,-m100 nothing but complements with the sound quality from the headphone jack is jaw-dropping,5
1172,love the kick-stand although it does seem to be sturdily made and of good quality,5
1173,both ends are a secure fit it fits tightly in the dock and charges at the same time very quickly,5
1174,pairing the soundbot to my galaxy s3 galaxy tab kindle and ipod touch,5
1175,9 ounces and the dimensions are 2 7 8 inches by 4 1 4 inches and will expand up to 8 inches,5
1176,however it does get hot but i think that is the most important part,5
1177,and the includedfelt case to store the battery pack or used for something else,5
1178,the motorola does not have a light but this one has a great balance of protection and portability,5
1179,has a snug fit around the phone and doesn't make the phone that much bigger,5
1180,this is my current go-to wall charger that works with all of my cases without the need to remove them,5
1181,one push of a button it will charge the iphone 4s will the apple cable,5
1182,it's not very large and fits easily into a pocket purse or briefcase,5
1183,let's you watch media on your phone to your home hi-fi,5
1184,good product works great the price is amazing and plan on ordering more colors,5
1185,battery life i've had it on for near 2 weeks now and it's still holding up great,5
1186,on the back you can put your credit cards money and drivers license in the case as well as the feel of the case,5
1187,it was so easy to snap on and makes the phone look brand new,5
1188,i have been using this for about one month and gave it to my daugfhters friend and she loves it,5
1189,the zagg skin on my husband's phone and has been a great companion battery for about 2 months now,5
1190,if you exceed your incorrect pin entries using moxier it is the only thing i would wish is greater variety of colors,5
1191,first if you get the film on and it's not quite as chocolate looking as the picture,5
1192,it is clear so i can still see the beauty of the actual iphone,5
1193,i test a lot of battery packs have wall wort adapters that you have to charge external battery with this,5
1194,sometime this is all you need when it comes to smartphone or tablet charging,5
1195,i keep it on my desk at work and the other at home,5
1196,it's my favorite case so far of the ones i've ordered i haven't encountered that,5
1197,i have purchased 4 of these to have extra ones around the house,5
1198,it is thin fits the phone perfectly and i have had it for 2 months and use it daily,5
1199,on another note i use my ipad for my job and i also use a ipad,5
1200,this is something i should've bought when i got my samsung cellphone a couple of years ago and it fits perfectly,5
1201,overall it seems to have a bit of weight to it,5
1202,its very thin and does not increase the size of the phone can make it awkward to hold in some situations,5
1203,they are very comfortable and don't fall off so go for it you will be pleased,5
1204,i love how i can slide it into my pockets easily and is no more bulky than a wallet,5
1205,the cut outs line up perfectly and there is hardly anything bad to say about the earpiece at all,5
1206,i have a new galaxy s4 i hear a lot of people say that the buttons are hard to operate in this arrangement,5
1207,my sister is very pleased with this case and would recommend it over any other one on the market,5
1208,i love it well worth the money i have spent on a bluetooth headset,5
1209,i always ask the individual how i sound because they always sound great to me despite the noise conditions where they're at,5
1210,this particular model fits great it leaves maybe just 1 32 of an inch larger than the lg but the phone itself is terrific,5
1211,of all of the mounts that i have tested this was one of the least expensive too,5
1212,like i said above it only took around 30 seconds to insert the phone and keep the slim and light feel of the iphone 5,5
1213,i have purchased an otterbox for every phone i have owned and it always protects the better than any other protector i have used,5
1214,this is the perfect case for my iphone 4s and have been happy with them as a seller,5
1215,i loved this case at first but after about a week they loosened up,5
1216,i pulled out another card just to test it and it dried of nice without any water penetration,5
1217,first you have to make sure it's still there,5
1218,that why i bought it for my dad and he loved it,5
1219,one good thing about it is that i can not use because of how the metal interferes with reception,5
1220,for charging larger more power hungry devices like my kindle fire hd and my samsung galaxy tab 10,5
1221,i use these as a stand for my phone at my desk fort is great,5
1222,it also comes with screen protectors and a stylus for free,5
1223,this charger is very portable the prongs fold in and the unit itself doesn't cover up the camera and even has a textured back,5
1224,i've had this case now for several months and it hasn't ripped broken chipped like others that i have had,5
1225,whenever people pass by my desk and they ask what this is and i am very happy with this purchase,5
1226,she has a couple of cases but this is my first all-protection case,5
1227,i've had cheap thin cases for my razr maxx since i got it and its exactly what it looks like in a case,5
1228,for fast mode in 60 mins it went from 20 % to 21 % in about 12 hours,5
1229,when you have this belkin case on it feels like the case is part of the phone,5
1230,most of the free goodies that come with it are quite cheap so make sure you have micro usb cords for your computer car etc,5
1231,it feels and looks just like the battery that came with the phone for a decent price,5
1232,good quality protective dual case my wife is happy with this case and would recommend,5
1233,i've bought this one is my favorite so far it is very stylish and at a great price,5
1234,i didn't have any problems with it being loud enough,5
1235,this case does cover the side power and volume buttons but sometimes it's a little difficult to fine tune volume station selection etc,5
1236,the connector for both the micro usb and the 30 pin ipod connectors,5
1237,i would have said that it would have been a nice feature to have if given the choice,5
1238,would be nice if you could charge it with your computer as well,5
1239,it is sleek yet very strong looking and i like the rubber-like feel to the exterior,5
1240,just what one needs to charge an ipad and my samsung note 2 at 1 full charge and a little bit from this battery,5
1241,it also comes with a psp micro usb mini usb and standard iphone so it's quite versitile,5
1242,i put it on in the bathroom after taking a shower,5
1243,the thing i like about this screen protector is the best of both worlds,5
1244,this case fits the phone very good the color is pretty and its not big and bulky,5
1245,with 8a over 5 usb ports you don't get the bigger battery with a bigger back,5
1246,the good side to that however is that it is less likely to slip through hands particularly while working out,5
1247,i had an issue with the other otter boxes i have used in the past for about a year,5
1248,also it takes the position of a case for the iphone 5 with a lifeproof cover,5
1249,i like to watch tv on my laptop but don't want to spend 30 on an apple one,5
1250,it is some what clear however the phone is black and the case has a great texture,5
1251,this adds enough extra juice to get me through the glastonbury festival in the summer,5
1252,they are also great to keep in a shirt pocket or jeans pocket,5
1253,what can i say this is a winner for the price tag,5
1254,i only used two of the usb ports labeled 8220 2,5
1255,speaking of typing i do not like the fact that it is working well so far,5
1256,ismooth includes several small stickers that you can use to put it on your dash lock the lever down and it locks onto your dashboard,5
1257,it doesn't interfere with the touch sensitivity at all,5
1258,no kickstand otherwise the case is perfect fits the phone snugly and won't just pop off like a squishy case,5
1259,this evo 4 g is an extended battery cover which is great because it does not flip open inside my purse,5
1260,now i have to go see if they have a version for your phone,5
1261,i own about 8 different cases for my note 3 and for all your large phones,5
1262,this is such a great lttle item that i bought two one for work and one at home,5
1263,this phone is new as far as i am concerned this is the best battery case yet,5
1264,but this case is actually the first one that i've had but that was impressive,5
1265,it is just long enough for me to take a chance and purchase a less pricey one,5
1266,after installing this extended battery and back cover for the note 3 and this cable worked perfectly,5
1267,i have been searching for my phone not only looks great but makes the home button better to press as well,5
1268,cons finger prints are very noticeable and it is not as bulky as an otter box in comparison,5
1269,no complaints the box says its for the galaxy s2 but i used it for a couple months and it is holding up just fine,5
1270,super convenient as you don't have to remove it to eject a cd,5
1271,it is scratch resistant providing just enough protection for the phone to make sure it fits your model before you order it,5
1272,the boys and men like the colors as they are all the same with the exception of color,5
1273,it's very stylish and i like that it comes with the micro sd slot and not removable battery or back cover,5
1274,yep i would buy it again or as a gift for friends and family,5
1275,i walked about 40 feet away from my phone and the sound is clear and loud,5
1276,the short cord that is used to charge the device and a 5v 1a port to charge your devices,5
1277,these little heaphones have a great sound now i can put my iphone face down with no concerns,5
1278,i've spent a lot of time on the road both locally and internationally,5
1279,i wove this one so much i ordered the black version and i keep losing it among my other pens,5
1280,products used in testing iphone 5s ipad minithis product was very easy to install and it comes with 3 to boot,5
1281,not only will it hold my ipad but it will also hold my tom tom xl 340 but the 4,5
1282,i do wish that it was just a little big on my phone but i put it on anyway,5
1283,for the price you really cant go wrong and with the 4,5
1284,i got this phone case for my boyfriend and he is really happy,5
1285,but after receiving the case for my galaxy note 2 and im very pleased with the product,5
1286,the nexus 5 as a whole is one of the best screen protectors i've ever had,5
1287,the silicone is really easy to apply to my 1phone-s,5
1288,if you leave the charger plugged in the other day and no problems with any damage to it or case,5
1289,the rubberized material provides enough protection for the handset that i'm not worried about ti falling apart anytime soon,5
1290,it fit perfectly and was able to continue to use this case all the time,5
1291,some people might complain about it being a little loose but it fits well enough to get a good protection,5
1292,this product was great i got a new phone because i allowed water to get into my new phone,5
1293,this is a handy little gadget to have on hand when you need some extra juice,5
1294,i highly recommend urban armor gear cases to anyone looking for a case to protect my new s3 phone,5
1295,easiest to apply and ive had it for over a year now and it's still holding up great,5
1296,i have had mine a little while and it is starting to fizzle,5
1297,this is a great case that has a nice rubber cover and then a hard plastic case to put around it,5
1298,i wound up spending a week looking for a decent case to carry my phone inside the defender case,5
1299,currently it is priced similar to power bank units in the 5000-5600mah capacity range,5
1300,the ringke slim soft feeling hard case is a very slim case and will protect against scuffs scrapes,5
1301,i use them for listening to music with my android phone there was a lot of horror stories of adapters breaking the pins off,5
1302,if anyone has any questions feel free to email me i would be happy to pay for one single charger,5
1303,they are nothing amazing but they get the job done what else could you ask for,5
1304,rather against my expectations i am very impressed with both the utility and quality,5
1305,it came with some charge to it so i plugged it into my car and it works wonderfully,5
1306,also watch the youtube videos on how to apply them it worked perfectly,5
1307,while some don't like this i do because it allows me to hang up or answer the phone from the headset,5
1308,i haven't checked the output but it seems to charge a lot faster with this than in a regular ac wall outlet,5
1309,this case does cover the microphones a little but the cutouts are large enough for plugging in without having to take off the otter box,5
1310,this is simply the best screen protector i have ever tried to apply,5
1311,now i can connect my external hd to this to watch my videos and stream games on it as well,5
1312,this battery pack is quite big and is definitely for men,5
1313,we put this on my wife's 5c and it fits and works great,5
1314,i bought two of these and have been happy with each one,5
1315,this is a huge problem as my main device is a galaxy note 3 and she loves my wallet case and she wanted one,5
1316,they contacted me to ask if i would be interested in trying this one as well,5
1317,this case protects it from drops feels neat to hold and i can stash some cash in the slit pocket for an emergency,5
1318,it charges in roughly the same time it takes to charge your device the price can not be beat for 10 dollars,5
1319,i had my uag case on my phone before and really didn't care for it,5
1320,oh my i love the samsung galaxy s3 screenmate tempered glass screen protector for my iphone 5s and ipad,5
1321,7 port1 yubi cable ac source 3 % charge in 10 minutesipad 2 plugged into the 2,5
1322,definitely needed this since my cord broke and i didn't have to pay verizon's roaming charges,5
1323,the case fits my phone perfectly and i love that it warns me when the power is low,5
1324,finally i have a case that allows me to show off my phone in the way it was holding my phone,5
1325,i also want to point out that this case is not mature enough but who cares,5
1326,i have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and i am very happy with it,5
1327,the item was just as pictured and it looks too cute,5
1328,the speck products candyshell grip case for iphone 5 black slate greythat i purchased with the phone,5
1329,i searched online and in stores for a cover for my iphone 5 and i love the one handed operation,5
1330,i've been searching for a car charger that would charge my phone and my company phone every day,5
1331,i got this headset last week wednesday and have been using it now for over a month and its holding up great,5
1332,i think these are the best on the market for the iphone 4 4s,5
1333,excellent so great i also bought one for my kindle fire and the battery is about to be used up,5
1334,i used the tape method to apply this screen protector because it were multiples in a pack,5
1335,it was filmy looking and i had a couple of questions that i sent via e-mail,5
1336,the headset can also be recharged through a usb port on a computer in order to use the voice assist,5
1337,i get the protection i need for my phone as well as for navigation,5
1338,over all i think it's a small price to pay to have the option to charge in multiple rooms,5
1339,no less than an hour after posting g tech armor contacted me and offered me a free replacement to experience the product again,5
1340,i have dropped my phone and few times and the case has saved the screen from damage,5
1341,the phone charges efficiently the case charges and holds its charge for weeks i keep it in my car,5
1342,so happy i bought this i was using it for just my phone but it works for everything else,5
1343,i have several cases for my phone and this one is the most sensitive,5
1344,i've been using this case for about a week and i think it's fast,5
1345,5 mm audio cable and a 30 34 usb cable with a micro-usb plug built in,5
1346,i got this because i didn't want to carry my bag,5
1347,let me say that i have owned alot of wallet cases for my iphone but this one is definitely the best,5
1348,first of all the pictures of the case don't fit the phone edge to edge which is what i wanted,5
1349,i lost that one at my old job so i was more than willing to try this out when i found it,5
1350,iphones are expensive enough as it is and i didn't want to chance compatibility issues with my samsung s3,5
1351,i decided i didn't like the original model because the button on the outside of the left arm,5
1352,with getting a new phone i wanted a more modern headset for when i'm in the shower and can't touch my phone,5
1353,4 rubberized hard cases combo for htc evo shift 4 g fits well and protects with style,5
1354,with both powerbank and non-powerbank versions it was fast and painless and enabled us to transfer all of our email accounts,5
1355,cant say enough about this phone or the fact that it does not hold fingerprints,5
1356,if you want to listen to the built in fm radio but you have to attach headphones for an antenna,5
1357,if you don't mind the extra bulk and i definitely don't find it too much,5
1358,this came from hong kong so it'll take a while to charge it really lasts,5
1359,bought this as a gift for a friend and have never gotten a complaint yet,5
1360,bought it few months ago for my galaxy nexus because i had two spares and it surprisingly worked out very well,5
1361,fits wonderfully it does add some bulk to the phone but i like that,5
1362,this is a well-built case that fits the s3 before i chose this one,5
1363,she has a couple of cases but i think i'll return the phone,5
1364,i still feel this is one area where manufacturers incl sony could do a better job of rating the right product,5
1365,the people that i called all said that i sounded crystal clear and that there was 0 zero background noise,5
1366,even came with a front screen protector like the otterbox defender,5
1367,it is necessarily covered with a screw-in plug extension cord that comes with the lifeproof case,5
1368,i have tried other small bluetooth speakers and this one stands out for the cable storage,5
1369,the phone also fits nicely in the car dock with this case you just need to remove the case ever,5
1370,i received a free sample of this product from the manufacturer in return for my honest review,5
1371,best of all i put the battery pack in my left back pocket and my phone in my pocket and it looks good,5
1372,the decision to put the power button on the top for about 3 seconds,5
1373,it took some time before i rate this because it was sent to me without living the current app video,5
1374,i personally have to sleep in complete darkness so this is definitely something that hasn't changed from the astro 2,5
1375,not too much just use it naturally as you would the tip of your finger and try your hardest to push the buttons,5
1376,there was a small mark on the face of the iphone just enough that it protects the phone,5
1377,and it protects the phone good and you can still use fingerprint recognition on the iphone 5s,5
1378,if you do you are going to have a significant restoration of battery capacity,5
1379,i've bought several anker products over the years and haven't been particularly thrilled with any of them,5
1380,but this does a good job of covering the edges around the screen pick up a lot of ambient noise,5
1381,i can also charge my kindle 3 at the same time and received the technocel clip later,5
1382,after receiving my supertooth ii i removed it from the phone and washed it in dish water,5
1383,turned out to be a bubble in the shape of a hippo with one big grey black eye,5
1384,imagine my surprise when i received it was how much smaller it was than the otterbox,5
1385,they are very good quality for the price of only one copy at your local mall,5
1386,i'm happy with this charger as it does with the verizon store car charger too,5
1387,to make the port hot you have to press the buttons to get it set on the vent,5
1388,however it does not detract from its appearance,5
1389,the mocreo universal world wide all-in-one power source very highly recommended,5
1390,my only issue is that i am not able to place it on my first attempt itself,5
1391,make sure you clean the screen then wet the screen protector and apply to the windshield where you would like,5
1392,i don't have the battery stats for the battery to charge but it works,5
1393,i love the 4 layer protection and the bumpers on the corners make it as practical as it is in pretty,5
1394,the bolse 25w 4 port usb charger is designed with over-heating over-currents and over-charging,5
1395,so i bought a gray case for my iphone and it fits great and looks great,5
1396,it does fit my 5s very well and i'm not using it for charging i'm using it to provide an extra,5
1397,i also must say that i do like this case a lot,5
1398,the build quality of this pen is the best of any i have had but they work well anyway,5
1399,run this app and you will never have to worry about my phone in this case,5
1400,the live tiles are cool being able to customize your phone having the true ability to multi-task your apps,5
1401,i bought it for my galaxy s3 however i got rid of the palm treo 750 and got the blackberry curve,5
1402,you should have your expectations set right you are not going to find a better case than the amzer,5
1403,to set the camera tap camera icon on the main screen and then hold down the number of your speed dial,5
1404,this adapter is great because it allows you to plug in two usb charging cords at the same time,5
1405,the grantwood case is more expensive but does not have any bearing on my 3 star review,5
1406,its a nice case for the price and definitely worth it,5
1407,one of the reasons it works so well is very reliable compact quick charging,5
1408,this is an awesome case everybody i come in contact with extremes heat cold water and impact,5
1409,other than the relatively high price i don't have any problems at all with this belkin adaptor,5
1410,1a between two ports a 1 amp and a 2 amp rated usb connector,5
1411,i just had a flip phone so this is a huge trade off for me,5
1412,the cable seems sturdy enough that i don't mind buying more as needed,5
1413,the screen covering works very well but does get a lot of grease like other it can save ur screen for some scratches,5
1414,the case fits great has a small lip to protect the screen when laid flat on a table,5
1415,you have to keep the phone to realize how much easier it is to use your ipad with this case,5
1416,which is better than nothing but i ended up using it for a bit now and it is holding up just fine,5
1417,this is a really good product and for the prize it is worth it,5
1418,i've tried four different batteries for my samsung galaxy s3 but right after i received it my phone broke,5
1419,i also find the thickness of the case though because it can be too powerful for some phones and may not charge them,5
1420,this particular batch i bought for my mother-in-law travels quite a bit and i always have a charger with me,5
1421,this is definitely a good product and i fully recommend it,5
1422,the case fits perfectly on the nexus 5 and i like the black case that fit for my htc evo,5
1423,the grip pattern on the back of the phone to rest on,5
1424,no issues no scratches the phone is in perfect shape it has paid for itself a few times over,5
1425,this case has a great feels and it is easy to transfer music from your computer or your car's cig lighter included,5
1426,yet like all smartphones it needs a case to protect it and it is easy to find,5
1427,i've already dropped it twice and not a scratch on it and in one piece,5
1428,ultraproof has design a case for the iphone 5 and up users out there,5
1429,they liked it was clear and easy to slip into a pocket or a purse,5
1430,i can personally attest to its ability to protect the phone,5
1431,this case is very nice and for the price you simply can not beat the price,5
1432,i'm a hello kitty addict and i love love love that it is matte and not shiny at all,5
1433,on the top face is the ravpower logo on top of that is snug and easy to fit,5
1434,loli can charge my phone with it on and use all the buttons,5
1435,the fit of this case is why i gave it 5 stars despite all the bad things i addressed,5
1436,my only real complaint about this case is that it is such a snug fit it makes these two activities a bit of a hassle,5
1437,i received a complimentary sample to test for a review i am happy with the order and you will be too,5
1438,the battery did a great job of protecting the phone,5
1439,ok yes it took almost a month to get to me from china but was missing the water mark sticker,5
1440,i did not try the screen protector that comes with it fits great too,5
1441,i was able to locate it on the dash of my car it doesn't slide,5
1442,to keep a long story short i had a mophie juice pack for an iphone,5
1443,1 amp slots this is a really nice phone case for the price,5
1444,first it comes with its own screen protector built in too,5
1445,i'll update the review but so far it's taking the charge really nice,5
1446,this cover is perfect for my white iphone 4 and it looks good,5
1447,while the size difference between this and the note 2 is just the best device i've used in the past,5
1448,highly recommended and the stand also comes in handy for clipping the stylus to a pocket,5
1449,a very good phone and i am glad i bought this case in december and i have been very pleased with this product,5
1450,the internet is way better on this phone than on my last and i have not noticed a difference in performance between them,5
1451,it is cute exactly what i was looking for made well and protects my phone perfectly well,5
1452,now when i need extra power and a way to charge both quickly and easily makes my life better,5
1453,every few days you'll have to pull the button and install another,5
1454,the ring isn't bright enough to be distracting but it shows that the charger is working,5
1455,it's a great choice if you want to show off our good looking iphone 5,5
1456,i even got one for my brother-in-law to use with her touch screen phone and she loves it,5
1457,it wasn't complicated to put the screen protector without any bubbles etc,5
1458,i really like its ability and portability and would highly recommend this product to anyone who want's protection without a high cost,5
1459,the product fits perfect and it costs a fraction of the price of buying wholesale apple cables,5
1460,looks nice on the phone and it feels great in the hands,5
1461,the red and yellow models are easy to see which is which when i want to change the battery than my original case from verizon,5
1462,vinyl is more durable but this is more than sufficient for us in our smartphones,5
1463,the only issue i have had with this super little charger is the first time i bought one from tudia will buy more,5
1464,no it won't protect from water damage but it will protect from scratches which was one of my cons above,5
1465,i've never been able to get it to work in landscape mode well,5
1466,it is rubberized and helps keep you from dropping your phone great colors to choose from,5
1467,these are usually backordered here but i only had to wait a few weeks before deciding whether the manmade material lasts,5
1468,this was a gift that was for a person who likes to listen to music while they run workout mow the lawn etc,5
1469,i have it on my samsung s3 and also my ipad for a while now and it works great,5
1470,the phone may not be the best option for this phone,5
1471,even the picture showed starting it from the top of a tree and my phone was still charged this morning,5
1472,i was able to charge my iphone ipad and wireless headphones,5
1473,this case has the best of both full keyboard and touchscreen but i can tell you that they are not all selling the same thing,5
1474,it's really easier to put on and take off and does not look big and bulky like most cases,5
1475,i was afraid it couldn't enter the case but when i received it i couldn't wait to receive it,5
1476,i have not gone thru too many stylus but this has been the easiest and most perfect screen protector i've used,5
1477,great feel and quality item for the amount of money and if you want a short-mount this is it,5
1478,every other phone case i have had for my iphone,5
1479,i have been looking for a 34 bling 34 case that is not bulky and still remains protective,5
1480,i've had no problems so far and i have had it for several weeks and it last all day,5
1481,i've been using this for a while now and hasn't had any wearing issues as with other cases,5
1482,one night after work i got in my car i had to plug the usb cable to the home charger and reconnecting fixed the problem,5
1483,people buy this product because it's very easy to use and great direction,5
1484,the seller must have listen to the other reviews this is the best case i've found,5
1485,not with this product also it is very easy to put on and seems to have less bubbles to work out,5
1486,the back is obviously thicker on this one but i hope they send them soon,5
1487,i have another one of these that i got for myself and loved it so i got one,5
1488,i look at this several times before i took a chance on the screen at warehouse gadget parts,5
1489,this cord is shorter than the original oem cable that came with my phone and half the cost,5
1490,the life proof case at the time didn't allow me to push the maps files onto microsd,5
1491,this charger is especially handy when you have two people in the car fighting over one charger,5
1492,it is so slim and sleek it looks just like a real camera,5
1493,the elastic inside is secure tight for mine but i wouldn't want it any more pronounced so that's a plus,5
1494,i have received so many compliments on it all the time,5
1495,it only has 500 mb total internal drive and comes with a 2 year warranty and upgradable firmware mine came with 3,5
1496,the back is raised enough to where you dont have to touch your phone while driving,5
1497,it's such a slim phone i didn't want to have to hunt for a charging place in the park,5
1498,it was fully charged which surprised me and i have used it for my itouch while on the cardio equipment at the health club,5
1499,s-voice is a joke but you can use a cord to charge other items,5
1500,i originally bought it for my galaxy note 3 in the box,5
1501,overall i really like this case and it does a good job keeping the clip in place,5
1502,supplied are three interchangeable inserts that can be changed to fit most bicycle handlebars,5
1503,one of my staff people has an iphone 5 and it was really clear and very durable,5
1504,i would recomend this case to anyone that has a free contract upgrade coming up for a phone,5
1505,this case is super cute and i always get compliments on it and for the price it can't be beat,5
1506,it holds a huge amount of power and is great for use as a holder for the phone in landscape mode,5
1507,i bought previously this brand case for samsung galaxy s3 with kick-stand at t verizon t-mobile sprint u,5
1508,it is important to note that the device is smart enough to stop charging when full,5
1509,i've only had these for two days so far and i'm very impressed,5
1510,i am sure since it has a spot for my credit cards i d and cash all in one slim clutch-like case,5
1511,there is no performance difference but it may be a consideration for some people but the micro usb charging port,5
1512,i checked hers out and loved it and was able to move files around with no problems,5
1513,there are so many expensive cases out there but i liked this one because it has that top snap part,5
1514,at first i didn't like the matte finish appearance then you won't like the mophie,5
1515,i purchased another batter for my husband because when we are on the road it minimizes the plugs that we need,5
1516,i came across this one and man works wonders and it feels as if you are directly on the screen of course,5
1517,if you're going to use this case only for as long as you have the appropriate plug adapter,5
1518,i love the price the quality is great and looks even better in person,5
1519,it had good reviews and when i got it it was really great and easy to use,5
1520,urban armor gear's listing on amazon notes that this case comes with three different colored hard plates so that you have the battery backup,5
1521,the usb dongle for pc use is actually a little larger than the apple brand one but it caused no problems,5
1522,i highly recommend this for anyone in the market for this type of cover don't hesitate,5
1523,these batteries are by far the best method for clipping my phone to thing like for camping,5
1524,reading reviews the otterbox commuter series seemed to be the best case out there if you're looking for a phone to tripod mount adapter,5
1525,i can now listen to music on my 45 minute commute to and from work about an hour and a half 2 hours,5
1526,this is a good quality case for a very good price and the free shipping was a pleasant surprise,5
1527,you can't root the phone yet anyway but i'm not seeing any of the headphone jack or charger fitting issues,5
1528,amazon has tons of cute cases for this phone on the xda developers boards,5
1529,also comes with an approximately 24 34 micro usb cable for charging the power bank and charging other devices from the power bank,5
1530,purchased this case for my daughter to be just a little thicker than desired,5
1531,i'm much more confident of being able to keep the phone handy while running or bike riding,5
1532,2 these batteries don't get as hot as it did on the nokia,5
1533,just love how this protects without being bulky and does take away from the brilliance of the iphone's screen,5
1534,the only problem the tool that came with it was not nearly enough to last me through the day but it does it,5
1535,i also have it paired with both my samsung galaxys fascinate and samsung droid charge,5
1536,this is a great buy if you just love to listen to music when we workout but not the same type of music,5
1537,both my husband and i have bought a few cheaper ones in the past and they are just a great company,5
1538,on my unprotected screens it glides across the surface of touch screens more smoothly,5
1539,great price and i tell everyone where i got it and amazon is what i say,5
1540,you might want to pick up a clear plastic face cover too then your phone will be totally protected if you use the defender case,5
1541,it's better than other screen protectors i've bought from illumishield for 2 different phones,5
1542,it doesn't look like it's been through the ringer in my truck and still works wonderfully,5
1543,and since we're always on the go this is the perfect case for an iphone,5
1544,works good for my iphone 4 and 4s so i can't really make a list for the cons part,5
1545,i like the way it fits on my phone perfectly with no problems,5
1546,i also can't really use this since you have to take the droid case apart anyway so not a big loss,5
1547,you'll never have that dreaded fear of running out of battery before i charge up at night,5
1548,i used it to charge my android phone and tablet also works with my headphones,5
1549,you can have someone behind the device as well as using the speaker as an alarm clock,5
1550,it is so fashionable and my phone feels so much more secure less slippery with this new case,5
1551,there is a small led on the side that indicates that the charger is inserted into the lighter correctly,5
1552,great case protects my phone good i've dropped it twice and the phone looks brand new,5
1553,i was a bit concerned that it would be a little better protected than before,5
1554,i am very happy with my item and they are worth the price and have the best reviews out of many others,5
1555,these battery tend to be slightly bigger than the average smartphone and is great for gaming and emails,5
1556,it charged my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it works with a smartphone and a pocket size digital camera,5
1557,so this time i wanted to try this model because of the retractable tip and received two great styli in the bargain,5
1558,this one fit like a glove and will not fall off easily when dropped,5
1559,i opened the whole thing up screwed it back in but it still doesn't immediately respond so you'll get a few blurry shots,5
1560,will be ordering more for to be able to change up the color schemes,5
1561,she has dropped her phone several times since this purchase with no ill effects,5
1562,but to my surprise it has fallen a lot and has protected my phone already through a couple of falls,5
1563,my verdict this is a handy device as you can use it as a conference phone,5
1564,this should be the only real option for a car charger for the your phones and tablets,5
1565,it not only has gps it has turn-by-turn directions built into all android phones,5
1566,i also put a motorola photon 4 g in the frame and that was fixed though mickey mouse with super glue,5
1567,got this for trips rental cars we'd use when my wife and i both have galaxy s4 phones and these fit perfectly,5
1568,i had the chance to contact the customer service and they listened to my issue and replaced it with no time,5
1569,pros compactlarge capacitylow pricecarrying caseeasy usageincluded cablecons glossy finish i would rather have a protector that fit closely and does not leave much gap,5
1570,i brought this because i had my phone for a week or so i love the feel of it and the tiny size,5
1571,the overall size and weight of the phone to the total weight,5
1572,only issue the glass raises it up a bit and make things a little more fun,5
1573,i use tomtom on my iphone as a gps device and this is the best one,5
1574,4 ice cream sandwich and i've now had a chance to test these on our recent road trip and it was very easy,5
1575,this protector is thinner than others i've used that had a rubber tip,5
1576,i love how quickly it charges my phone and doesn't affect the view,5
1577,great buy the price wasn't bad for an unlocked gsm phone 3 months ago,5
1578,i have this in white and the material seems to be fairly flexible and should absorb a shock from a drop,5
1579,as if i didn't have a case on it for the last five or so,5
1580,i'm now walking around my house listening to music from my mp3 players ipad and htc evo while sitting outside,5
1581,i have two tiny bubbles at the top not on the actual screen but in the screen protector of the otterbox,5
1582,there are similar units selling for more than twice the price of the lg tone depending on where you get it,5
1583,i really like having the screen to know how much power this device has left before it will need another charge,5
1584,you could use this with a case designed just to protect the back of my samsung galaxy 3s smartphone,5
1585,the batteries arent held in place very well by the plastic outer shell,5
1586,never once had it fall out of the car's electrical port as it doesn't seem like 2piece when its on,5
1587,it has lots of fun options so many that i've come to the realization that the cheap plastic 5,5
1588,would recommend this to my friends don't like how the power and camera buttons are fully functional and less apt to be accidently operated,5
1589,i've had my rezound since january of 2012 and the only thing i haven't quite figured out the one-hand use yet,5
1590,only wish this came with some sort of pouch or case to put it in for a trip to disney world,5
1591,update 2 i contacted the seller and they got back to me within 24 hours and replaced the case with no issue,5
1592,and this is coming from someone who has over a dozen cases for my iphone 5 but still love it,5
1593,the large battery 12000 mah charges all my devices at the same time when we go on trips and we'll only need one outlet,5
1594,i use it on my motorola phone and it works just as good as the oem battery i had when the phone was new,5
1595,so far the fit is good and all the openings are lined up perfectly,5
1596,this screen protector is very thick and durable but still comfortable to hold,5
1597,i am always losing them and it is great to protect the phone from dropping it,5
1598,if you get it on a buy 2 get 1 free if you find colors you like,5
1599,this brand works very well on all three and they look very stylish on the iphone,5
1600,not too hard to install if you are not a techie,5
1601,for one thing you can pair and connect more that one device at once,5
1602,so if you don't succeed the first time you have to press the power button and voila you're golden,5
1603,this is the best car charger that i have because it is capable of charging 2 usb chargeable devices simultaneously and in good timing,5
1604,after a month of use i'm still on my first screen protector for 3 months now,5
1605,i then tried a speck fabric shell case and i loved it till i got this one and i am not dissapointed,5
1606,worth every penny to keep you charged up this is it,5
1607,the case is slightly grippy so it won't easily slip from your hands,5
1608,it is cute soft and a great protector for the full glass face of the watch,5
1609,have bought diztronic cases for my last three phones and all of them have been wonderful,5
1610,it's a large button on top of the unit for accessibility to other electronic devises,5
1611,either way these things run great and you can't beat the price a real bargain for a brand name quality product,5
1612,it adds some nice understated classiness to the phone without making it too large for other phone cases to go around it,5
1613,the soft shell is tacky enough that it doesn't leave any air bubble,5
1614,the best part is the attached lightning plug so you don't completely lose all use of the power jack,5
1615,i also enjoyed how easy it was to slip the case onto the phone and the fit is flawless and really protects the phone,5
1616,you will find they fall out of your ear if you aren't using one of the hooks,5
1617,it all depends on what devices you have hooked up it may not be able to charge your cell phone,5
1618,i like how it repells dirt dust and fingerprints and is thick enough to protect it from drops or scrapes,5
1619,i had to keep all of the air bubbles out so you can not even tell there is a screen protector installed,5
1620,i bought this case for my husband and he really likes it great quality,5
1621,the instructions also state to keep the headset on your ear push a button on the earpiece and the sound volume went down appreciably,5
1622,i love the screensaver that is anti-glare because the usually show less smudges and fingerprints than the clear shields,5
1623,kept them scratch free and i was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans,5
1624,this case is definately worth the money especially since i got mine from the seller trd-trading gmbh with guaranteed amazon shipping,5
1625,it hooked up like a dream and i now have a better grip on my note 3,5
1626,it may cost a little more than some others but you get used to it after a while,5
1627,the single amp will charge your ipad but it did for me,5
1628,the flashlight is one of the brighter ones i've seen and it's ideal for charging electronic devices on the go,5
1629,i bought this speaker so i can use it as a battery back-up powerbank,5
1630,when this case came in the mail i was excited to find this screen protector application for the iphone 5,5
1631,i have this charger on my desk at work and enables me to easily see the battery's capacity down to the percentage,5
1632,it's two chargers for the price of one was easy to apply,5
1633,this case fits perfectly to my iphone 5 and recieved my first pair,5
1634,i've been using this charger for a little over a week now and i am very happy with my purchase,5
1635,when recharging is necessary i have found that it charged both devices quickly,5
1636,well ive used it for a week now and they're excellent for the price,5
1637,now i have one at home one at work and one at home of the longer stylus,5
1638,i have had it for a while and it kept my phone safe and never cracked it is very durable,5
1639,it is smooth and it does add some weight but nothing extreme,5
1640,this is a great price for an unlocked phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly,5
1641,i like my otterbox case but it's still quite protective and i like the blue black color,5
1642,this is not a big problem and i'm not sure that it cancels noise better than any others,5
1643,always buy these screen protectors because they are really good at protecting the phone so really why bother,5
1644,44since there were no reviews i was not sure about the size of the galaxy s4 screen awesome job guys,5
1645,i have to say that the noise reduction is not as good as the original iphone cables that came with my phone,5
1646,i have a couple other types of these batteries but this one is in a good price it's well worth it,5
1647,the power button and the volume controls which i did not have any air bubbles or dust caught between the screen and the screen protector,5
1648,that's the price you pay for protection of the phone as well as transfers data without a hitch,5
1649,i like this one because its just like the one that i got with my device so i guess it gave the best of it,5
1650,again this cable works fine gets the job done and i am satisfied by these results,5
1651,yeah it has a flashing blue led on it to indicate that it is charging and the device is created to not overheat,5
1652,i have to say this is the best bluetooth i have tried,5
1653,i was skeptical about if it would hold on to a rough surface,5
1654,i like the textured clear back to show off the white case of my new s3,5
1655,it will help you get the case and screen protector served my old iphone very well,5
1656,at work especially i only need an i d and credit card secured in the slots and my phone fits perfect,5
1657,sound quality for the bathroom is great as the speaker is on the opposite side of the device,5
1658,gave one to my sister in law she liked it,5
1659,i liked it so much that when i first had them i have to admit that it is very nice,5
1660,do not forget that this is a large unit at over 4,5
1661,love that battery charger charges very fast and i don't have to charge it as much,5
1662,it protects my phone as well as convenience of carrying my phone on my belt and it is equally sturdy and works as advertised,5
1663,i've used a few portable batteries but for the most part it's the best headset i face during my life,5
1664,i'll just explain how it performed with my nexus 7 tablet keeping me powered on longer trips and vacations,5
1665,it fit my galaxy 7 perfectly and i like everything about it that i do not like is all the rhinestones are falling off,5
1666,it paired quickly and easily to my samsung galaxy note 2,5
1667,but then again i see others with this type of case because it does not have specialized charging ports for android or iphones,5
1668,it charges my phone from 0 to 100 % took around 10 hours,5
1669,the battery life is exceptional so far i have been very happy with the excellent value,5
1670,gets the job done looks great and has a great 34 grip 34 to it,5
1671,case provides protection without adding significant bulk to the phone and makes it easier to grip,5
1672,its not a monster case so don't expect it to be so small,5
1673,yes it isn't cheap but it's worth every penny thanks to amazon got it for 1 2 price,5
1674,it fits well above my visor and only took a second to find that it's a full board computer,5
1675,tr and the minisuit low profile case i am as happy with this batch as i was the first,5
1676,in my tests it worked perfectly as if there was nothing on the iphone 5s i just had to have it,5
1677,there is a power switch on the top and a blue led to indicate activity,5
1678,if your device doesn't have bt or you don't want to bring the wall power supply along,5
1679,i can also attest to the durability of this case is very good protects my phone very well,5
1680,sound quality is very good and the buttons still feel good,5
1681,despite the fact i've had it on the dash of my truck and it is no more great protection but not invincible,5
1682,i know it will also work great on my kindle and ipod touch,5
1683,all in all great product superb customer service and a great product at a very fair price,5
1684,okay just got it yesterday and i've been extremely pleased with battery life,5
1685,they also fit nicely in just through just about any case no matter how stylish would be a grave injustice,5
1686,i used many different apple devices in a week and it seems to be holding together pretty well so i bought one for him also,5
1687,the finished product on my s3 is as though nothing is on the screen and you're stuck with annoying little particles,5
1688,i love the 4 foot cord it's a great length for charging it on my night stand,5
1689,amazon prime delivery on time product works and at a great price you still can't go wrong with this order,5
1690,to top all that off it also has a built-in flash light and a red laser light comes on,5
1691,this is going to be an integral part of my business and it is always in use,5
1692,i've never really pushed it to see how long it takes to charge your device from 0 %,5
1693,green light shows it is plugged in and charging it stands upright so i can see the phone through the case,5
1694,i also had no issues with the screen protector or anything,5
1695,once open you set the phone face down without the screen making contact with the surface,5
1696,should own an external battery as an emergency power source when i am traveling,5
1697,while it adds some bulk to the phone's profile but that's a small sample size,5
1698,i've had it for about 2 months now and there's no sign of any unpleasant odor,5
1699,i contacted the manufacturer and they immediately replaced it and shipped it no charge,5
1700,ok so i've had this case for a week now and i love it,5
1701,i have a samsung galaxy s3 and i'm using it right now,5
1702,but you'll pay more and those have the 34 orange peel 34 appearance has almost been eliminated,5
1703,if you know what you're getting for the money,5
1704,as for fitment it's very similar to an otterbox symmetry case,5
1705,it's a screen protector it was easy to install and it looks great on the phone and looks great,5
1706,i'm not particular about this so i don't physically cycle the microsd connector needlessly,5
1707,lightweight to the point that you can end the day with 20 % or so left on the battery,5
1708,it on my phone now and i have no complaints about this case,5
1709,and judging by its quality i won't have to worry about harming the battery by overcharging,5
1710,i've already ordered an extra one for my samsung galaxy note 2,5
1711,i bought 2 of them one for each of our touch devices,5
1712,i have ordered one for my husband and my new phones,5
1713,it's funny after reading many of the reviews for this item are being merged from different sellers,5
1714,i have also taken it on a couple of fully depleted gadgets and let you know how the performance has been,5
1715,when you plug them in you know what's happening when you press the button the led lights go on but will not remain on,5
1716,beware of magnets near credit cards but with this case there are no problems pressing the volume power buttons at all,5
1717,i got this because it was a great price and would definitely order another one when this one wears out,5
1718,it's just perfect for lay on the table design not for youit goes b4 the screen,5
1719,i use them daily at work most of the day and i use the a port to charge my bluetooth headset,5
1720,i been looking to get headphones as my old one was starting to die more quickly than usual,5
1721,i can say i would recommend this phone to anyone who is in a need of small extra charging while on the go,5
1722,i received the black case is very well constructed and charges my samsung note 3 very quickly,5
1723,it's a tight fight and yet it doesn't interfere with the virtual keyboard although i don't have a cd slot,5
1724,i was very fortunate that i had a case i ordered this one and another one made by anker,5
1725,the answer is yes it appears to be the same case holster as you get at verizon,5
1726,yes its not the most protective case but it will get the job done then look no further than this phone,5
1727,there is a ball socket joint that allows the phone to click in out of the mount safely securely easily,5
1728,the sound is great especially for the money it looks incredible aesthetically is very sleek and sturdy,5
1729,you are able to hold on to your ears pretty good,5
1730,coolest cases every time i use it to talk as well as for my kids electronics,5
1731,i 8217ve used it to charge my cell phone is a nice bonus,5
1732,for a case that is going to basically double the size of your phone and the position that you want it in,5
1733,there wasn't a lot of money in a case,5
1734,i was a little concerned about how it will take a fall but going to avoid it as much as possible,5
1735,it gets great battery life since it's so easy to use that no directions are needed,5
1736,if you get the galaxy gear you have the option to choose between 1a or 2,5
1737,this protector is great in that it will charge a wide range of devices,5
1738,it's charged my phone a dozen times and it didn't leave a mark,5
1739,it slips on and off easily and seems to be pretty durable and is adjustable for comfort,5
1740,speaker phone works just as good as if not better coverage,5
1741,i'm not delusional this oxa speaker rivals those and i think that it is a nice easy to use phone,5
1742,bought this to charge a spare battery i bought for my blackberry this case has no issues,5
1743,no air bubbles at all anti-glare matte finish works great even under direct light,5
1744,a voice tells you that it is ready to be used nothing to download or install any kind of software,5
1745,why i say that is because the sound quality on these phones is crystal clear,5
1746,would absolutely recommend to anyone who has an iphone and is a lego fan,5
1747,overall this is a great case at a reasonable cost,5
1748,purchased this case for my iphone is one of the fastest us released android phone and it comes with a removable strap for carrying,5
1749,extra bonus to be able to connect two devices at once,5
1750,it isn't as flexible as i thought it would be more metal but it's plastic,5
1751,it charges my phone in my purse without the pouch i charge on-the-go power supply,5
1752,with what you'll read about the phone you'll know it's charging when the light starts to blink,5
1753,cons it is too bulky to carry everywhere,5
1754,i would really recommend this case if your looking for something that is primarily just to listen to music,5
1755,i use it with my galaxy tab i will need to get a bulkier case specifically designed for that,5
1756,a really nice cable that actually works better at charging my iphone 5 or ipad and my girlfriends iphone 4,5
1757,this case is great for my galaxy s3 it works really good to keep the phone from sliding around too much,5
1758,i've had no trouble pairing the bluetooth with my phone and it has just a light scuff on the corner,5
1759,the battery charged quite fast i have used it for my itouch while on the cardio equipment at the health club,5
1760,when i found the commuter case i liked that it was very easy to put on and once it is on its stays on,5
1761,about twice the thickness compare to the original samsung battery and it tests the same,5
1762,the quality is excellent and it charges fast,5
1763,in this window you get to see the back of phone for any potential damage,5
1764,cheap and it come with extra so it was a good buy and great price with fast shipping,5
1765,this is an original i purchase this for an extra for my phone so i can dress it up like the old barbie dolls,5
1766,personally i'm not a big fan of the flip out prongs,5
1767,i have tried several cases but this is the one i'm keeping on my phone,5
1768,i would recomend this holster if you are looking for good protection this is the case for you,5
1769,some quirks that can be worked around is if you want to change batteries or case to another and i just like it,5
1770,bought as a stocking stuffer for my mom and she loves to use them with her iphone,5
1771,it's also one of the most comfortable headsets i've owned and i've gone through some great ones and horrible ones,5
1772,will certainly recommend to anyone looking for a great deal for a sim that normally costs 8-10 bucks,5
1773,its a tough case still fits snugly and protects my phone well and i can get my podcasts in,5
1774,had this product for about a month and so far it's working great,5
1775,also i use mine to listen to audio books in the car,5
1776,got this as an etra to have in my car or somewhere just in case is amzn,5
1777,update july 2012 i've been using and liked the otterbox commuter for my iphone before and this is the same thing,5
1778,once the juicepack was fully charged i was able to get 7hrs of use and still battery was not fully depleted,5
1779,there 8217s also a micro usb input port for recharging the device itself,5
1780,my iphone earpod jack works just fine with the s-pen on its right,5
1781,i also got the case in blue so that i have a littel variety and love all of them,5
1782,but i love it and am going to be getting one for my daughter and she loves it,5
1783,very fine well considered design and appearance and protection for the iphone 5 without compromising much of its design,5
1784,this battery and charger is a great addition to the kindle fire's accessories,5
1785,both the cases protect the phone well and importantly it does not show scratches even after intentionally running keys over the back,5
1786,it's great knowing i can keep my devices at hand's reach,5
1787,both those lose connection while i'm working out is a welcome feeling,5
1788,i rarely run out juice now and i'm able to keep in inside that box hidden and it still works,5
1789,i hear the person on the other end that connects to the charger,5
1790,pairing is easier than most as well with a press of a button on the back of the packaging,5
1791,i have and will recommend this to my friends and family,5
1792,i used my phone after working out at the gym and spending a lazy afternoon at a cafe,5
1793,for this price you just can not go wrong and the price is good too,5
1794,if you install it well you won't know it's there and after months of hard use,5
1795,i am extremely pleased with my purchase of this battery,5
1796,the bottom left corner was broken when i got it i will repost that review here,5
1797,in fact in can be a pain to put on so if you like to play such games you might consider a more lightweight protector,5
1798,mine have worked just fine and you will not have to worry about losing your phone,5
1799,the battery comes with a 2-in-one usb cable that has a universal female port on the other end,5
1800,one thing i love about this case is that i really don't think you needed it to setup the unit,5
1801,take a look at this case i was happy to see that there were so many positive reviews as well,5
1802,1a 1a i just inserted the new trent usb charger comes with a usb cable to charge,5
1803,i didn't know it came with it and didn't realize it comes with its own usb cable and a nice one too,5
1804,first of all i have added an image that you can use to hold the pro as you sit or walk around,5
1805,this one is a full 30 34 long which is a little ridiculous for in-car use,5
1806,this is a lightweight well made case that offers great protection without making the iphone feel large and clunky,5
1807,but within a week it seemed normal to me that i don't even know i have a case on my phone,5
1808,i can use a micro-usb for other phones,5
1809,the charger arrived early and it does it's job and charges my phone my complaint was the cable lengt,5
1810,i'm going to rate this high because it is exactly what it looks like in the picture,5
1811,seems to charge a bit faster than any of the other cases i bought,5
1812,-the 8 mp camera is one of the best thing i ever bought,5
1813,i dried the water droplets off charged my ipod touch 4 g and hubby his iphone 4s with the 30 pin adapter,5
1814,i took off the screen protector that came with the otterbox,5
1815,it's snug enough that my phone is within easy reach,5
1816,it may be expensive but to me it's easier to hold in the hand,5
1817,looks great slim improves grip protects the phone from drops and provides a good slip free grip,5
1818,love the slim line and you can barely tell that there is a screen protector on the phone bubble-free and crystal clear,5
1819,it was even off in the box when i first opened it i wasimpressed with thew quality of materials,5
1820,to charge the duracell powermat gopower long haul battery by duracell is a very handy device to own,5
1821,has a place to put i d or credit card at home got your phone,5
1822,definitely deserve five stars for the performance but i am going to sand it down and perfect the fitment,5
1823,worked better than most and to be honest i wasn't really expecting from a floating speaker,5
1824,i wouldn't call it heavy by any stretch but it's great for a purse or luggage,5
1825,i love the color scheme and the way it feels in my hands is different,5
1826,worked flawlessly on the note ii love the fact that it was not only half the price of the others a steal,5
1827,this case fits my galaxy note 2 perfectly,5
1828,after shattering my iphone screen i wanted a case that showed off the gold on the back,5
1829,this caseology case is a very pretty color and protects the phone from drops beautifully,5
1830,i am very pleased and would recommend this to any s4 user,5
1831,works well and would recommend this item to all igo users,5
1832,this case feels similar to the back of the case is nice and fits fine,5
1833,at the same time it worked great and i haven't had any problems using other in-ear earphones you will love these,5
1834,all in all i like it a lot thanks so much,5
1835,this screen protector is a definite recommendation to anyone in need of screen protectors for my phone,5
1836,i bought a pretty case for the phone and was really pleased with it,5
1837,the price mah is about the best out there and this case is no exception and i've bought them for my last three phones,5
1838,they do a very good job of protecting my screens,5
1839,replacement battery for the original oem that was no longer holding a charge for more than 4 hrs,5
1840,overall it's a pretty neat device for those who like to watch videos on their phone,5
1841,provides great protection easy to apply and remove the phone,5
1842,i like having the lights on the micro end of the cable but it would be the phone ability to use more than that,5
1843,i have a nokia lumia 900 which is a bit heavy but not to big to carry around,5
1844,i leak tested it before leaving and was impressed with the use of baffles to enhance the sound,5
1845,i was happy that all of the buttons and the screen are responsive,5
1846,doesn't protect front of phone but i use it as my everyday case,5
1847,the quality is remarkably good for a stylus that is both versatile and stylish,5
1848,inside the box was the charger and a small instruction manual which is mostly warranty information,5
1849,cases are easy to put on and get all the bubbles out but if you can it will be a great gift,5
1850,firstly the weight of the battery pack is modern and classy,5
1851,my hearing is not so great and i like a lot and i had to have it,5
1852,and i was happy to be able to call clients and vendors,5
1853,this hd bluetooth receiver works great and the audio jack works well also,5
1854,i also do not have any type of awful smell it is very easy to remove when getting out of the car inside the house,5
1855,enjoyed them while they lasted had no issues with this charger in outlets that others have trouble with,5
1856,every galaxy series i've had now although i don't have two phones but some people do,5
1857,i kept looking days later and came across this case on thisiswhyimbroke and fell in love with it,5
1858,once it's in place which is a good thing when applying screen protectors,5
1859,t fits very nicely with both cases my friends don't even realize i have a headset on,5
1860,i got the one with pre-installed buttons even if i had to go into a verizon store to activate my phone,5
1861,really i bought the black one for my black s5 and it looks great,5
1862,fortunately the phone was in the waterproof case which i was able to fully charge my iphone 4s to 98 %,5
1863,i have a black cover similar to this one and they attach to the phone in 2 pieces,5
1864,i have bought many cases in the past but this one is my favorite shiny and cute,5
1865,i also love that you can charge two devices simultaneously,5
1866,i like this case more than i thought it would be,5
1867,i love this thing so much i do not leave home without a spare battery,5
1868,i have tried several different film coverings for the iphone 4 and 4s but does not list the iphone 5,5
1869,i've tried a couple of bluetooth headsets before both plantronics,5
1870,i dropped my phone several times and never had one single issue,5
1871,however it does make the phone look bigger but not as much as an otterbox defender case,5
1872,automatic zoom on the nexus is a bit hit-and-miss depending on where you are using this,5
1873,the case itself is well made and all the right details are there 8211 there are no issues with this one,5
1874,doesn't scratch easily and fits nice easy to take on and off to exchange different colors quickly with leaving hard case on,5
1875,i have gotten a few different kinds trying to find one that would work out for me,5
1876,it is also great because it is small and compact with folding prongs for storage and travel,5
1877,additionally it has a usb port so you can only charge one device at a time,5
1878,came with charger extra battery and i holster that you can charge a battery and two devices phone ipad ipod etc at the same time,5
1879,i am horrible about dropping my phone but this case is so much cheaper than what i would have paid at my cell phone provider,5
1880,all in all i will only look towards realook for screen protectors for any future touch screen products they offer a protection solution for,5
1881,i like that it has the microphone so i can skype with my buddy in thailand without tether,5
1882,i love the stylus draw something is so much more fun and easier to use than clamp mounts,5
1883,i had wireless charging for a while with my ipad and samsung smart phone,5
1884,it takes up more space so i have to keep my nails extremely short at all times,5
1885,i applied my fingernail to the top part of the other case i purchased at the same time as you are watching something,5
1886,very satisfied with my purchase and i plan to use a lot so i don't have to take the back piece off,5
1887,simply plug it in do a bluetooth sync from my iphone 5 to an ipad to an air card,5
1888,plantronics hl10 handset lifter was what was promised and it was delivered on time and is easy to take on and off,5
1889,the one thing i found that was weird was that on the back where the blue sits on my white phone,5
1890,i highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or replacement these are the exact same headphones,5
1891,a nice feature with the voyager pro hd is a big step up from those,5
1892,already saved my phone from a drop but it's better than nothing,5
1893,second there are no magnets to hold the phone in place and the belt clip have excellent construction and quality springs,5
1894,fits very snug and looks like it will protect the phone in a drop but it feels nice and is comfortable to hold,5
1895,it's very light so you can hardly notice the design which i love,5
1896,it is compatible with all the iphones and ipods that they were supposed to be designed and the price is super low,5
1897,it's easy to put on and can't even tell i have the protector it's seamless,5
1898,considering these retail typically at 35 this is a great value same as the one that they sell in the store for 30,5
1899,i really don't think they take anything away from the original industrial design of the iphone 5,5
1900,i bought this charger for me and my wife for tablets and our phones,5
1901,i have been using it to keep my galaxy s3 alive for 2 days,5
1902,all of my clients loved them and they do exactly what they are supposed to be replaceable,5
1903,other than that it has an amazing battery life this is for you,5
1904,you can also try 2 tablets but it just won't charge as fast but to not be able to tell the difference,5
1905,i love everything about this phone its fast and has the perfect size to match the att nokia lumia 920 body,5
1906,so far used in the conversion of the iphone 5 to the htc evo and doing actual hands-on usage locally,5
1907,this is a beautiful piece of design work,5
1908,edited after using this for even longer i am impressed with how quickly it shipped and i received it,5
1909,it took a little longer to charge but that's okay as i do this at night,5
1910,i wonder if the contacts are robust as it doesn't look very sturdy but it actually gives the righ amount of protection,5
1911,she's had it on for a month but looks great with no bubbles what so ever,5
1912,it lies comfortably around your neck and the earbuds are comfortable,5
1913,what makes it stand out even more is the metal plate on the phone or in it's case,5
1914,3 to 4 months may not seem like a lot to ask for but even with android 2,5
1915,this was purchased for my wife and she absolutely loves it,5
1916,i also like that it tells you exactly how much power is left on the handset,5
1917,i had read some complaints that this phone didn't come with ear buds i wanted the oem type,5
1918,i also purchased one of those gel silicone cases and this one i liked best due to the grippy sides and the color,5
1919,top notch quality and economical are two things i do not like slide volume control,5
1920,have used motorola headsets since i have had a couple of these during my 4 and 4s ownership and it was flawless,5
1921,i had this same particular charger when i first bought my iphone 4s a couple of years ago,5
1922,it even came with a dongle so you don't have to keep it plugged in for longer use,5
1923,cons the only con i can think of for the i-8800 is about the size of an external hard drive for work,5
1924,i like it so much i am going to order one for my 5 g now,5
1925,comes in handy in you have an iphone and not a wanna be iphone,5
1926,oh well i am sure it is a problem with apple's firmware on the damn phones,5
1927,the positioning of the case provides a small lip around the sides of the phone,5
1928,been using it more and it's quite handy when you need to throw it in my bag or briefcase,5
1929,after using this every day for 1 month it has never failed to retain my phone during snags and other issues,5
1930,so be sure to use the correct port you need for the device you are needing to charge,5
1931,my only complaint is because of the design of the tablet stylus,5
1932,my grand daughter hasn't seen it yet but i'm sure it will fit in with any case,5
1933,the tablet was merely charging and the battery increased from 52 % to 66 % 14,5
1934,it is comfortable to use with easy access to all the ports and the color looks great,5
1935,i can honestly say i have never seen a screen protector of this quality before,5
1936,i liked this product it came with a long cord and not to mention a replica of hanna's phone case from pretty little liars,5
1937,a year later it's still on my phone and i had no issues flipping it on and off,5
1938,also it came faster than i expected and i love the design,5
1939,i'd been very happy with them and the price was great,5
1940,cafe's and coffee shops don't always offer a place to plug in which prompted me to look for an extended battery,5
1941,00 for a single screen cover and ended up throwing it away because i could never install it properly,5
1942,my phone has escaped unscathed and the elevated ridge around the edge of the aluminum case to split it from its plastic underside,5
1943,like all mobile broadband devices this isn't a good or bad thing is that they don't offer it for my nexus 5,5
1944,the color and the look of her phone frequently go android,5
1945,4 amp output current from each of the two usb ports you press the power button to start charging,5
1946,would like it to allow you to maybe sync it to your computer and you can listen to you music,5
1947,in terms of the protector itself it's exactly what you came to this page looking for buy it,5
1948,this is my 3rd anker product i have purchased has exceed my expectations,5
1949,the retractable ball-point pen on the other side but it is still really nice,5
1950,more than this you couldn't ask for a better response,5
1951,the trick is to put the bottom of the phone rest can be lowered or raised,5
1952,i knew this was true because when i had plugged it into the wrong cord to charge and fried it,5
1953,i've tried just about everything on the phone is easily accessible,5
1954,he was very pleased a the price and it is very high quality and all the holes line up,5
1955,i really like the blue light that turns on when it's plugged in and is powered,5
1956,so far only used it on my galaxy s3 i get alot of compliments on it and is thinking of buying more colors,5
1957,the battery holds a charge for a long time so must have a good reputation,5
1958,people who have seen it ask where i got it it is just like the one sold at apple stores,5
1959,it fits a well or better than the body glove i use for my motorola v551,5
1960,hard to find but i'm very glad i got this oe battery rather than a battery not from samsung,5
1961,there are larger batteries available but they make the phone look and feel more rectangular a bit more like the one for the iphone 5,5
1962,they are almost indistinguishable from the apple cable which is a nice touch,5
1963,it is very thin which is great because it doesn't tangle up with other cords,5
1964,at that point i don't think the stand will work with the phone in a diztronic case,5
1965,the hub is very small and the fact i dont hurt my ears when i walk away,5
1966,the holster is nice but the clip unlike the case does not allow for this and it takes some getting used to,5
1967,and the best part was that the cutouts at the bottom are all more than sufficient,5
1968,i would recommend this case to anyone with a nexus 4 needs to get one you won't be sorry,5
1969,some people have complained in reviews that they had to remove the cover to take the battery out a lot,5
1970,got it for my samsung galaxy s2 epic it was a perfect fit and design was just right,5
1971,i have no use for that feature so i did not test it since i had no need,5
1972,in the case of the balistic design this is not an issue to under grade the product,5
1973,if you want to enjoy the great feel of the htc skin and input,5
1974,now with the battery pack i can charge my phone wherever i am i don't have to be gentle with them either,5
1975,protects the phone and would recommend this product to everyone who uses touch pens,5
1976,it fits tightly and securely but doesn't take an act of god for it to come loose,5
1977,it does the job well but you can't have the flap flipped all the way around covering the camera lense,5
1978,so far i know i am very satisfied with this product will recommend to friends,5
1979,if i had to guess i would have to say that this case is one of my favorites headsets now,5
1980,we have had quite a few different phone holders and this is the best hands down,5
1981,pover all i am satisfied with it and don't get me wrong i did keep my eye on it just in case,5
1982,fliptronics chocolate panther leather wallet case for samsung galaxy s2 was purchased,5
1983,otherwise the back is a nice touch to have,5
1984,overall it feels more premium compared to other note 2 cases i've tried the speaker volume is lower and their is some reverberation,5
1985,i can't get it on perfectly but once in place you are not going to put micro sd slot,5
1986,a case is a necessity to me and it doesn't make them excessively hot though they do get a bit warm,5
1987,yes the case adds a little more size to the phone but nowhere near the quality we're looking at here,5
1988,i would differently recommend this product with anyone who looking for a case for my iphone that is not bulky and live longer,5
1989,it works well on my iphone 5 and ipad mini,5
1990,con it can be a little bigger to better fit the plug that comes with the htc evo,5
1991,i've had this for almost 2 years now and its still working great,5
1992,i have a goal zero solar panel pack as well and it's becoming an incredibly useful feature,5
1993,in the time i had it worked well and was of a favorable oem look,5
1994,so it was nice to have the extra length to charge my phone,5
1995,i did the steam method in the bathroom with the hot shower trick to minimize any airborne dusts,5
1996,also great for holding the phone up so that i can use the wireless charging on my phone,5
1997,i do have to open the flip on the side to keep the cover closed while talking via the cut out for the bottom 3,5
1998,i use the belt clip and it is not needed,5
1999,this can be quite convenient for keeping the cord out of my way while making my phone look fabulous all at once,5
2000,i have had it pop out of my pocket when i reach for it,5
2001,i've had this case for almost 6 months now and it has held up very well,5
2002,doesn't like a lot of iphone cases out there,5
2003,we purchased 3 for company phones as well as an otterbox without the bulkieness of the otterbox,5
2004,i received it on time and i am really pleased with their builds,5
2005,when i searched for what diztronic was offering i was thrilled to see the same one was made in this color,5
2006,all in all it has exceeded my expectations to great lengths,5
2007,follow the instructions to make sure that it's compatible with ipod iphone ipad and android,5
2008,it is the perfect size to put in my back pocket for easy travel,5
2009,the case feels nice in the hand and doesn't make a large bulge in my front pants pocket,5
2010,i really like this change because if there was anything i would like to see is the on off switch,5
2011,it just takes about a month to come in but it was worth the wait,5
2012,otterbox is the cadillac of iphone cases and the slider cases are my favorite,5
2013,since i'd been so happy with a tpu case for my phone and this does the same job basically,5
2014,i bought this based on reviews that said it was for those of us who don't have perfect vision this screen is very readable,5
2015,other posters are correct in that you can't see through as clearly on the left,5
2016,it is still the best bluetooth headset i've ever heard including every product jawbone has ever made,5
2017,my first attempt at using a stylus for my iproducts a long time ago,5
2018,i ordered two different cases for my phone and this battery lasts all day long,5
2019,if you use this type of tool on a regular basis you 8217ll know what you want,5
2020,the power and volume buttons work fine with the case on the camera lens on the back of the case,5
2021,does the job and i am very happy with the product despite the cons,5
2022,9830 had no problem charging an iphone and an ipad at the same time,5
2023,so yes i've flipped my phone and put it any pocket or messenger bag,5
2024,this case by diztronic offers the best protection for a non-waterproof phone protector,5
2025,the zl battery for my wife's old cellphone which she did not want to get a kindle just to read,5
2026,my unit arrived with just one usb cable that has both the micro usb and the earphone plug are not covered,5
2027,again this doesn't get in the way of anything and it won't block the adjacent outlet,5
2028,this is a 5-star product because it is exactly as it looks in the picture maybe a little more neon,5
2029,i had considered using a spare battery but this is not the case with this bad boy,5
2030,however the sound quality more than makes up for that with everything else,5
2031,this item is very nice and i'm very happy with it,5
2032,i tried many anti-glare screen protectors is they all have the same general method but this one doesn't have that issue,5
2033,this battery allows for 3 devices to be charged at the same time by the imp130 battery,5
2034,it's a huge improvement over the former apple earbuds and as good or better than you would expect but bass is a bit lacking,5
2035,so when i carry it i have to carry it in back pack on the plane,5
2036,it's a good feel and seems like it will last a good few hours with moderate usage,5
2037,this is a good basic charger for my iphone 4 which i was extremely happy about,5
2038,after a while i took it off because it was dusty around the edges,5
2039,the best reusable protector you will be able to charge 2 devices simultaneously in a car,5
2040,i usually charge my extra battery over night and it's ready in the morning for the next few days of use,5
2041,keeps your phone clean and so much better than the last one i owned,5
2042,i tried several chargers and they didn't put out enough power to charge my new phone,5
2043,i have the spare to back me up for the rest of the family aren't big fans,5
2044,i literally bought 5-6 cases this one is actually a vast improvement over the stock one,5
2045,exactly like the original that came with the samsung note phone i just bought,5
2046,got ta say i'm glad to have a couple of spare batteries for my gs3 i'm finally totally satisfied,5
2047,so far i only use the charger about once a month and after taking off and replacing the cover a few times,5
2048,the trexcell did much better than 16 hours that when it was new but within a day's use the resistance was gone,5
2049,received this today and i had to put it on it looks awesome i love it,5
2050,the build quality on the charger is very helpful as well,5
2051,this is a dual port car charger that can charge 2 tablets at once,5
2052,fit and finish are all great and i will definitely be purchasing other colors after this one wears out,5
2053,i never worried that it was going to be not worth it,5
2054,i was not happy about how long it took to charge up from the box,5
2055,june 24 2012 received this three days ago and tried it on my galaxy note ii right now,5
2056,i then decided to move on to a smart phone thats easy to use and super fun,5
2057,this case is a must for anyone who uses their phone for music or gps,5
2058,the powerflow quadfire works as you would expect and at this price is a great deal,5
2059,so there are a lot of them and they all do their job perfect,5
2060,one important note is that the sides of the case so that you can remove it and reposition it easily,5
2061,they work great on both my kindle fire hd and it charged much faster than using google's cable on the charger,5
2062,i still like this headset over the 550 but the battery life is awful having extra chargers around is really handy,5
2063,the protective carrying case and charge cable is what sets this apart from the others is the material used to make the tip,5
2064,this car charger has a simple design that will charge almost any device and most phones two or three times,5
2065,forget everything else this is the case to get if you own a note 2 seriously consider getting this screen protector before anything else,5
2066,its sleek and very well designed to attach to the hybrid battery it is not meant to,5
2067,the only downside i have with the case is that it doesn't interfere with the lg nexus qi charger from google,5
2068,also i get a ton of compliments on it and it came a couple days later,5
2069,however this is the best and i mean the best screen protector you can buy at this price,5
2070,i got it very quickly and i was able to revive it from a very bad error,5
2071,case as for the case it is built quite well and for that price it was worth it best ones yet,5
2072,once plugged into the wall outlet it is quick to charge your phone and a computer or outlet is not near,5
2073,this iphone 4s case seems to be just as good as three feet when used properly,5
2074,this thing can make getting the phone out of the case is a matte finish,5
2075,i would like to see more back plate colors and the addition of a case that fits better than any case i owned,5
2076,i love it i have dropped my phone and nothing happened but replaced this with an otter box,5
2077,it has an iphone look to it and i also like the fact that it has an elegant look to it as well,5
2078,for the low low cost this is an amazing product especially for the price,5
2079,there was definitely a lot of thought put into the design of this case is well planned and thought out,5
2080,i'm using it for traveling because of it's size it actually doubles as a gps holder for me,5
2081,hold it down for 3 seconds to turn on and off the data sync cable without having to unplug it to use the phone,5
2082,they discharged at the same rate as the ac charger that comes with the phone is very tiny,5
2083,very sturdy case and seems to be well made again can't beat it for price,5
2084,i had ordered these and when i applied them the holes for the camera flash power button etc are aligned nicely,5
2085,it does exactly what it's supposed to and that it feels nice in the hand not overly heavy very well protected,5
2086,this is the best car charger that i've seen being only 2,5
2087,it fits either and will fit both with a case on the phone until they pick it up,5
2088,if you're not in a situation where you need to take a written note or sign a document,5
2089,i have had no problems and it feels like i am not even holding a phone,5
2090,the solar panel is not intended to be recharged from a usb port on a computer but at a slower rate,5
2091,i have only had it for a day but they seem great so far,5
2092,it's easier in the hand and it doesn't add bulk to phone,5
2093,i work at a phone store and do it all the time every time the earset wake up,5
2094,by far my favorite thin case i have bought for my iphone 5 and looks great,5
2095,i had the pixelskin for my iphone 4 that needed a new battery,5
2096,i suspect that it will hold up well over time and my phone wont fit in the mesh inside the case,5
2097,i had used a gs3 previously so i was concerned that i would encounter many typos because of my large fingers,5
2098,the cable and connection are built well and the packaging is perfect for that,5
2099,my note 2 is protected by an otterbox you aren't going to get sound like a nice pair of cans,5
2100,it's very sturdy and it fits my phone great,5
2101,but this headset works really well and also obviously can stand up to some wear and tear and keep the same feel as the phone,5
2102,it was easy to apply with not a lot of bubbles if you do it right when installing,5
2103,when you put this case to your phone it looks like it came from the factory and or amazon,5
2104,the third suggestion is simply a matter of making sure that the customers are satisfied and happy halloween everyone d,5
2105,i have two other bluetooth headphones and this is my favorite feature of this charger is the built in outlet prongs,5
2106,i listen to audio books and this is perfect for the man who works in construction and keeps the phone in place,5
2107,the aduro screen certainly isn't scratchproof but it's thick and it seems to not damage the phone,5
2108,it doesn't last as long but it could be because i'm not used to the case yet,5
2109,great instructions to help you get the most of this marvelous moto engineered toy,5
2110,but i've found that it works great for me in an odd circumstance,5
2111,i was using a note 2 sprint while my wife was using a samsung intercept so i gave her my motorola,5
2112,i love how easy it was to pair with my phone,5
2113,to same anyone reading this review a lot of time i felt like a fat rubber band would work better,5
2114,plus it helps to make sure it won't turn on by accident like my last one did so that's a plus,5
2115,i purchased the black case for my nexus 4 and all of them have their,5
2116,what i love is that i can use my phone all day,5
2117,comes with 2 hd and 2 matte so you have the option to choose between 1a or 2,5
2118,also included was a usb cord for charging the unit and your equipment,5
2119,very cute case i liek it it's like a cheaper version of the seidio cases out there,5
2120,i am a perfectionist and it took me a few days to get here but it was worth it,5
2121,this battery is flawless and is by far the world's best damn case,5
2122,this is a basic car charger and connects to my iphone 5 and it looks good to me,5
2123,the installation instructions were easy to follow that said i still watched a few youtube videos and find the method that works best for you,5
2124,i give this case 5 stars because it is a good cover,5
2125,unfortunatelly we got it for another tablet and since it didn't fit with the hybrid case on because the end was too thick,5
2126,not that i didn't think of it before,5
2127,call quality is clear on both ends of the call that i have ever used,5
2128,works great with both the iphone 4 and 4s and they works flawlessly on all of these devices,5
2129,i've owned the new trent imp70d for over 6 months and it hasn't affected my use of the cables thus far,5
2130,i can put my note 3 anywhere on top of this charger whenever you are not using it,5
2131,as an added bonus it's actually one of the cheaper cases online this is truly beautiful,5
2132,works great and does what i wanted for my htc one m8,5
2133,i purchased my s4 for 200 when it came out and it's easy to wipe clean if needed,5
2134,5 mm audio cable from it to my car stereo's usb portlow points have to use at,5
2135,and i wish it had a front camera,5
2136,when i go out i use a third battery to take with me as i am prone to forget to bring it with you,5
2137,i've had other chargers that would get so hot that they couldn't be held comfortably,5
2138,but none of the these can be used in the portrait or landscape position,5
2139,with two sd ports i can charge my ipad and iphone,5
2140,i've been using it for a few weeks now and i am still in love with it,5
2141,so if your lifestyle requires you to have your phone on you but you know it's about to die,5
2142,i did test this on skype to see how it would do and it worked just fine,5
2143,works very nice with my htc evo v 4 g was far better than any of the others,5
2144,so this particular charger only a little bigger than my old phone droid razr,5
2145,this is a great case that really protects your phone this isnt for you,5
2146,the camera holes are larger so you don't have to sacrifice usb ports on my computer and most of them are,5
2147,it is very attractive and i've dropped my galaxy s3 about 6 times so far,5
2148,uses a microusb cord to charge meaning i can carry only one unit to charge multiple phones tablets etc,5
2149,the volume is also much higher then i thought it would be about twice the weight of an iphone,5
2150,the guys that brought this to market did a great job and quickly charged all their phones without any problems,5
2151,the case does show scratches on the case not the screen protector itself,5
2152,not only can we use it for my galaxy s4 with spigen tpu case,5
2153,my brother bought the s4 and i have to say this is the best of the bunch for the s3,5
2154,i need my i d card to get into lab and i always end up with bubbles that don't come out,5
2155,update after living with this unit for a few weeks now and absolutely love it,5
2156,i own a galaxy note 3 so i didn't really need it because the oem iphone plugs work fine,5
2157,i bought this for my daughters phone and it securely holds the phone and i recommend them to anyone they are awesome,5
2158,it's far less prone to scratches than any other screen protector i've ever seen and i'm picky about that sort of thing,5
2159,great to have a fully charged battery in the morning,5
2160,1 mp qualcomm msm8974 snapdragon 800 quad-core processor 2 gb ram etc,5
2161,ok so i just got this shield today and have only had a few minutes to play around with it and you'll need them,5
2162,this is especially true of the camera and flash were also very good,5
2163,the ips makes it so you can remove it and hide it from view,5
2164,this installed so easily and perfectly with no bubbles i can't say that i can really tell a difference,5
2165,95 rubberized case with a kick stand and screen cover,5
2166,the color was dead on and so pretty and i was so happy and regretted not getting it sooner,5
2167,i have a black iphone 4 and one for a white iphone 4 this bumper is one to get,5
2168,the stylus package is a great mix of smooth yet grippy,5
2169,the instructions came printed on the backside of the phone to the total weight,5
2170,yes it's a wire headset but has anyone found a bluetooth headset that does double duty with their cellphone and pc,5
2171,i also keep it tucked away until needed and i don't have to work a whole year to pay for it,5
2172,i feel well taken care of and still looks and feels great on hand,5
2173,phone might cause screen saver to come loose if too close to the edge you may get a little bubble under the screen cover,5
2174,works great and i think it's as good as bare screen,5
2175,this case adds little bulk is easy to remove so i can place my phone in it secure in both landscape and portrait view,5
2176,i have been using them for about 6 months now and it's so much easier than putting the clear back protector on,5
2177,i have been using this for several days now and find it as good as the jabra stone i use most of the time,5
2178,the only issue i have with this is the power cord is not detachable from the charging block,5
2179,the rotate out the second battery while i am out all day golfing or not at home,5
2180,my boyfriend ended up stealing it from me after a week or so its still doing fine and holding strong,5
2181,i like the motorola skin and tweaks much better and i've had no issues with it staying closed even with a glass protector,5
2182,it charged my ipad iphone just as fast as if it was plugged into the ac adapter,5
2183,plus cheap enough that if it breaks you can just replace it and its like new all over again,5
2184,i have been looking for 6 months for a good stylus and couldn't find anything under 13,5
2185,i was concerned about the cover being slippery to hold but it's still easy enough to slip in it out if you want,5
2186,you see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the pocket the screen protector is more sturdy,5
2187,although i rated it a 5 because it is exactly what we've been waiting for,5
2188,have received several compliments on this case and it is a great case for the droid incredible,5
2189,it is slick enough that it slides right into my pocket with out any problems,5
2190,personally i use it to charge it still has 65 % at the end of the day,5
2191,so while it is smaller than most stylus but my daughter doesn't seem to care because mine comes with nintendo perfectly spelled,5
2192,i have this on my work phone and absolutely love it,5
2193,i've never had to take it off and reapply it if you get it wrong the first time,5
2194,fully charges my ipad and its great that its portable because i can keep my devices charged while on the move,5
2195,i use this with a samsung galaxy note ii phone and my oxausa power banks,5
2196,normal silicone cases cant protect your phone from drops so what's so great about this unit is its versatility,5
2197,an led lets you know if the charger is active it lights up blue,5
2198,i no longer have to remove the case around the phone,5
2199,i recommend you root your phone so you can listen to podcasts internet radio etc,5
2200,5 feet long enough that i don't have to be near an outlet again,5
2201,you get 16 gb of storage which is more than enough to handle anything you throw at it,5
2202,many screen protectors i have bought would have a lot of bubbles to block the picture,5
2203,this is acceptable as it is easy to use by people of any age,5
2204,my unit came with a usb to microusb cable that can be used on a moments notice,5
2205,they are easy to install without bubbles if you read the instructions and do what they say,5
2206,see photo with the supplied cables i also hooked up my amazon kindle fire hd 7 4400mah battery,5
2207,still i can wear them for hours and not even remember it was there,5
2208,i have had it off the charger for about 30 hours,5
2209,the size is perfect for carrying around in your pocket for when you need it,5
2210,have dropped the phone when getting out of the car inside the house,5
2211,i only wish it provided more coverage for the top and the bottom so you will end up with this one eventually like i did,5
2212,i like this case so much i got it in the first place,5
2213,i've been using this mount for a few days but it seems really nice,5
2214,i can use the usb end of the cable locks into the devices firmly,5
2215,flash light looks useful as well but i didn't really want to destroy the aesthetic of the phone,5
2216,i was prepared to be disappointed but ended up being very impressed by the ability to carry around with me,5
2217,the stiff film is easier to install than any other screen protector i've been able to use the usb plugs to charge many items,5
2218,i bet most people with a note 3 will get a phone case that will hide it forever,5
2219,i have extra batteries that i change out at least once a week and i can charge it on the go too,5
2220,and each time i've used it it's been great,5
2221,i've gotten spoiled by the ability to make it to the end of the usefulness for my iphone 5's internal battery,5
2222,with that said for short trips i find that i can have a full charge when i need it,5
2223,the retractable point on the trent stylus allows me to keep it in my backpack at all times and use it for my alarm clock,5
2224,in all cases the cable changed its light within a few minutes of searching i came across this beauty,5
2225,i ordered one before and i had to give one to my husband and he loves it,5
2226,i'm an amateur photographer and don't always have access to a plug,5
2227,it looks exactly as it appears in the photo more of a true orange but it's good enough for everyday mishaps,5
2228,it was purchased as a gift and she totally loved it so much,5
2229,with this usb cable i do not need to replace the back cover of my galaxy s4,5
2230,this is exactly what i need to have with me to make sure i wasn't having any more problems,5
2231,i think my problem is that i put a thick lens protector on the phone so that the screen is protected,5
2232,having owned both products i can tell you that patuoxun stands behind their product and offers a lifetime warranty unlike other competitors,5
2233,holds phones on the side surge protection and usb ports that don't fall out of your pocket though,5
2234,my sister was extremely pleased with this charger and would rebuy,5
2235,if you use a slim case similar to this one and it looks good but didn't solve the slippery problem,5
2236,i bought this because i wanted to be able to charge your phone battery away from a power outlet for awhile,5
2237,i am going to leave this screen protector on for a year now and my phone has worked perfectly every time,5
2238,i'm still using it i have it on right now and never had any problems,5
2239,these protectors are without a doubt the best cover i have ever had for my iphone,5
2240,unfortunately i have dropped my phone a bunch never a problem,5
2241,it was cheap came fast and lasted a long time with what they were put through,5
2242,works well unlike two other chargers i've tried but i'm wary of other products,5
2243,on the other hand if you are looking to go with a phablet,5
2244,this is my first smart phone but i'm comfortable with the phone in my pockets as it always ended badly,5
2245,5 total ipad tapes and it was almost the same price as other power banks but the bonus for free,5
2246,wasn't using it heavily sunday but still my stock battery would be almost dead by the end of the day you are going,5
2247,you are waiting on an important call and your cell phone runs out of battery despite my best attempts to keep it charged,5
2248,why pay three to four times as much for the 34 original equipment 34 at the phone store,5
2249,price is comparable to what you'd expect from the larger capacity though consider the price differential,5
2250,it can charge while in use but i am not sure that it is a viable replacement for the battery in the phone,5
2251,the droid's call quality is good and the volume is sufficient to hear above road noise,5
2252,it allows me to position it and still be able to have control of your music as you walk around,5
2253,i know many watches require that but you may want to charge an iphone and an android phone in the work truck,5
2254,use this for my g1 when i want to listen to live mlb games while doing other activities,5
2255,if the tpu outer mold came in a variety of colors to choose from to personalize your phone a bit,5
2256,after getting a replacement iphone 5s gold i immediately put on the black home button easy to install,5
2257,i've had it for a few weeks now and it is a great product for anyone who is looking for a comparison,5
2258,and in spite of its weight it does not interfere with the camera speaker microphone input ports or buttons at all,5
2259,i do occasionally play games on my iphone and not have to worry about my phone sliding all the car seat,5
2260,the in box pouch was very tight and smooth so a little more difficult to apply than any other type of screen protector,5
2261,it fits my smart phone and my work phone so easily,5
2262,i bought 4 cases for my note 3 and i had no problem using this mount,5
2263,4 and the nexus 7 doesn't have a microsd slot guess again it has a mini usb and the kinivo has a micro,5
2264,what i love about this case it has a rubber coating on the inside so it doesn't scratch,5
2265,only problem i had was not being able to charge with on but other wise im fine,5
2266,i've been getting about 2-3 hours to charge my samsung galaxy s2,5
2267,it does things that i'll never use but it's nice that it's white and matches my iphone,5
2268,there are indicator lights to let you know it is plugged in properly,5
2269,the body is tapered to make it easy to remove the adapter from my ipod but you can feel the difference,5
2270,the case came on time and it was perfectly packaged,5
2271,this review is for new trent 1pc limir dual purpose stylus and fine ball pen for all capacitive touchscreen devices,5
2272,the screen covers were great and worked well on the iphone 3gs and ipod touch with ios 4,5
2273,the inside cover is felt lined for the face of the phone you will be surprised on how big the phone is,5
2274,now the phone no longer feels like it's going to go the way of the 8 track and cassettes,5
2275,i ended up buying another one of these for my daughter son-in-law,5
2276,this product is not pretty but it works and you don't get the zoom detail like you do from other phones no,5
2277,tech armor wins by being a great product great price and i use it every day and never had any problem,5
2278,the folding blades makes it very convenient to watch shows on the plane or to prop up the phone,5
2279,she loves it and it works very well i love it thank you,5
2280,the bottom opening for the micro usb port is only used to transfer files,5
2281,because of the high storage capacity this power bank takes several hours to charge and considering the amp rating that is expected,5
2282,if you lose your charging cradle you will have to get another usb cord to plug into a charger again,5
2283,this is a nice case that will protect my phone from drops which i've done it several times,5
2284,the matte finishing looks good too and doesn't detract from the design of the phone is also noticeably increased,5
2285,it does not add bulk at all and at the same time it makes me look cool,5
2286,but it still works well and is very useful love this case,5
2287,the dknight magicbox ultra-portable wireless bluetooth speaker is cute comes in a variety of colors,5
2288,the coat definitely makes the item look like it's worth the money and they last for a long time on a charge,5
2289,it comes with the powerbank a usb to micro usb cable to connect to pc and attach a standard 3,5
2290,there is a thin cushion in the holster to keep it from seating too deeply,5
2291,the tip isn't rigid to the point where it didn't fit into lumia 1020 but this case doesn't do that,5
2292,my otterbox has protected my phone from any dings and drops,5
2293,i just found the this case from new trent covers the home button completely,5
2294,a few seconds later the cover will stick to the screen and after a few days of use,5
2295,i use them on all the phones for my family members and they are greatful for it,5
2296,gotten nothing for compliments on this case it has a texture to it,5
2297,i had so many people ask me about it and where i got it,5
2298,it's a great size and i love the blue light as it lets me know it is working and charges devices like crazy,5
2299,5 months since i bought the mount and in the past few days it gets better with each and every run,5
2300,cons the instructions are poorly translatedjust so you know comes with one micro usb charging cable that came with your original device to be charged,5
2301,it works with the carbon-fiber type pattern of the phone and looks very chic and certainly more expensive than it is,5
2302,excellent case and workmanship plus the case doesnt add much bulk and really do a good job of isolating sound,5
2303,that's okay because i mainly use it for my ps3 but i use it on the stock battery as well for a spare,5
2304,i'm starting to like the fact that there is no lip doesn't bother me one bit,5
2305,the only caveat is that if you're looking at a more expensive one than this 9,5
2306,love the double protection with the soft rubber inside and the hard rubber outside,5
2307,it doesn't add that much extra bulk to the phone but it does insure protection from drops etc,5
2308,25 by 1 inch so its just a little larger than the apple brand one but it caused no problems,5
2309,i've been using an otterbox commuter case for the htc dinc has proven to be for me,5
2310,it went on easy and fits my phone like a glove and it does not inhibit my keyboard,5
2311,for the more entertainment-minded people out there you'll be happy to have this spare tire battery handy at all times,5
2312,it was just what i needed i love this item it looks so powerful and neat,5
2313,i feel the price could be a little cheaper but it is harder to line up not the fault of the phone,5
2314,the gogroove audiohm hf is a great set of headphones that will not disappoint,5
2315,first off let me assure you that this is a great phone,5
2316,ive always installed my screen protectors this way and ive never had a problem using these with my phone,5
2317,i have been using them for about a month now approximately 1 hour per day,5
2318,besides i liked how the one x looked more like the blue s3,5
2319,its not protective at all so you'll have to find it via a search,5
2320,my phone bling and this is one of the best in the market,5
2321,this case is my favorite due to the fact that you can use different color everyday,5
2322,it definitely comes in handy if you want to clamp onto something,5
2323,in my case it's a perfect travel companion for charging both my phone and tablet either in the hotel or in the car,5
2324,i look at this several times before i took a chance on the screen at warehouse gadget parts,5
2325,all the buttons lined up perfectly and work without any issues at all and i highly recommend it,5
2326,touch screen not the first blackberry with the feature and it's not as good but it's ok,5
2327,i currently own 11 cases for my at t iphone 4 it is a perfect fit for use with the seidio extended battery,5
2328,10004 what i like about the screen protector that it doesn't have much grip to it,5
2329,i got one of these as a for review unit but no promises of a good review were exchanged or implied,5
2330,the packing makes you feel like you've used it before,5
2331,once it was ready i took it for a ride in his mouth,5
2332,amazon is actually the first to have some kind of oleophobic coating and again it works,5
2333,make sure you eyeball the images closely to make sure you're in as clean an area as possible,5
2334,i always buy my cables on amazon and this is the best hands down,5
2335,i've dropped the phone several times and not a scratch,5
2336,i use this everyday in my car and i can charge my phone in addition to these types of cases,5
2337,i had one small bubble at the very corner and it came out with no bubbles can't complain about that,5
2338,i tested the charger with my kindle fire tablet so i use this as a spare battery,5
2339,when applied it went on quickly and smoothly with only a couple of bubbles that i could not get out but it does not,5
2340,it is absolutely perfect for me and for who i am speaking with,5
2341,pairing the headphone was fast and easy on my iphone 4 and it still fits snug in the case,5
2342,5 mm patch cable to non-bluetooth devices with headphones output too,5
2343,it's portable but i don't know if a case could be better designed for this phone,5
2344,be warned this device is a little heavy but doesnt take away from the cuteness,5
2345,this is a small charger with two usb ports 1a and 2a dc5v should be able to charge my ipad 3,5
2346,carrying bag is a nice touch and shows that the company cares about their products and have a full support team,5
2347,also these last forever even when the phone is in the middle and not on the handle bar it's self,5
2348,you can be secure with this type of case and the phone survived,5
2349,there is nothing wrong w armorsuit its a great product i wish i could have been the at christmas to watch her use it,5
2350,love the price and probably the best case i've ever owned by far,5
2351,it's minimal size also allows the phone to charge and one in an external charger,5
2352,here are a few things you need to know before deciding to buy 1,5
2353,double-clicking is a lot faster than the charger it came with is ok but not high amperage,5
2354,the cover has a good grip to its texture and it looks nice on my desk at work the vibration is extremely loud,5
2355,bear in mind too that my phone is a bit large but otherwise this is a good quality screen protector is perfect,5
2356,the holster is great to have because you can choose to use a different refill color or pen width,5
2357,i found that this charger can be used for data connection to your pc,5
2358,about twice the thickness compare to the original samsung battery that comes with the phone there are three rubberized and two plastic tips,5
2359,this review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge in a very timely and efficient manner,5
2360,the 5200 has a large power button on the top for about 3 seconds,5
2361,contra some of the other folks with this dock i didn't have an extra battery nor a battery charger,5
2362,perfect size the stylus works just fine with the charging cable from my phone,5
2363,the design allows charging the phone while in the driver seat with the phone plugged into a,5
2364,if you buy a gel case you know that it's being protected by a sturdy case but not too much,5
2365,the strap gets in the way a bit when you try to power the device on,5
2366,i downloaded the app and found it to be a pleasant unnecessary feature,5
2367,it covers the sides and back well and the sides wrap around the edges of the screen protector on my phone,5
2368,they 8217 re so lightweight and comfortable that i forget that i'm wearing it,5
2369,screen capture not a big deal but it would be nice if there were some other color options to choose from,5
2370,very impressed with it is exactly what i was looking for,5
2371,the button positions are easy to use and it's easy to lose em,5
2372,buy this case if you have i'm sure i don't have to fight for a car outlet with my family,5
2373,i was sad to see that it didn't get squeezed or pinched by my case,5
2374,personally i like using this more for my phone because i need the protection especially in the corners,5
2375,i've had these for a few months and im still crazy about it,5
2376,even if just for gps purposes he would still have to look down to see where i am going to next,5
2377,a little bit of research and faith i finally decided to get this when i found it on top of bunch of rocks,5
2378,i bought this as a backup to the original one from the wireless store,5
2379,the nt120c is a 5 out of 5 stars i've ever given,5
2380,i see nothing wrong with some of the initial batch made so i returned it and bought a different colored one,5
2381,great for those who love the look and appeal of the iphone 5 and transferred it into this case,5
2382,i turned on a streaming movie and was blown away by how strong this item really is i love it,5
2383,gr8 alternative for a cheap price bought this for my galaxy s2 skyrocket-excellent value,5
2384,and i still seem to run out of charge in about a half hour,5
2385,the only thing is that it gets dirty but what do you expect for free,5
2386,the neo hybrid does not have this problem at all with the charger,5
2387,i have dropped my phone several times since i put the case on it was fairly easy,5
2388,overall the screen isn't the best but i love the way the plug snaps back into the case for transport,5
2389,pairing was super easy turn the unit on holding the power button for several seconds to power on the headset,5
2390,it 8217s aluminum and it almost doesn 8217 t feel like it will slip out when holding it,5
2391,i use to have to charge my phone while my grans are charging their toys,5
2392,i'll loved this case when i first got it i thought it was too good to be true,5
2393,so far i like this case and screen protector so much that i'm going to get another one for my other car,5
2394,i have a kindle fire and it fits nicely into the 8220 plus 8221 size holsters advertised on amazon,5
2395,these cases have either cracked or ripped after a couple of months it's like changing shoes,5
2396,4 the y design is narrow enough that it doesn't dangle and interfere with other clothing pieces,5
2397,i would defiantly recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their phone and prone to accidents,5
2398,this is a nice case for the htc evo lte phone also,5
2399,i really liked the little grip bead stuff on the sides so that its not so easy to drop your phone,5
2400,hdmi included so you can connect to non-bluetooth devices pairing took just seconds to pair with my iphone 3gs,5
2401,they've been in use for nearly a year and still works like a charm,5
2402,it is small and lightweight but it works great with this case and does not bubble up,5
2403,another advantage to this case is that the volume and on off toggles and is more comfortable in hand,5
2404,i consider myself a heavy user on the galaxy s3 and for the price you can't beat it,5
2405,great sleek case for the iphone 3 g with a case on the droid 2 but oh well it works so i'm happy,5
2406,flip it over and you will see a big difference in ease of installation and has held up well so far,5
2407,i am very glad i bought this and i recommend this to everyone,5
2408,if you're power-hungry or on the road a lot and do not have access to a charger for many many hours,5
2409,this was one of my first cases for my iphone 4 and it still works great,5
2410,the inside cover is felt lined for the face of the phone up when put down face first,5
2411,this case is well made and fits the iphone 4s perfectly,5
2412,just before the first trip i got an astro mini for use with my samsung tablet especially for doing crosswords etc,5
2413,we have two motorola photon 4 g phones as well as other devices using usb mini-usb connectors,5
2414,i read in the reviews that the suction is very strong and holds my phone without any issues,5
2415,you have to adjust to the side buttons but once you get the trick down to get it on then its easy,5
2416,functionthis battery pack is very functional and i had no problems either opening it or extracting the cable,5
2417,i got this for my daughter to protect her phone,5
2418,they were very quick to respond when i thought i had a problem they quickly resolved it,5
2419,my iphone regularly shows that the charger doesn't work but not a surprise for the price,5
2420,it allows you phone to snap in and out easily and is especially useful for those locations where only one electrical outlet is availbale,5
2421,i really like the style of this case a lot and it will probably become my permanent one,5
2422,for on the go charging this is a perfect accessory for anyone using a portable device with a touch screen,5
2423,it doesn't add much bulk to the device while keeping it safe,5
2424,i generally choose products by the axiom you get what you pay for and with the solemate max you get a lot,5
2425,this protector has minimal if any affect on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online,5
2426,my wife doesn't use one of those but i'm so glad i did because this is one cool looking cable,5
2427,the airstash a02 is a handy wireless device that is compatible with the iphone 5c but have used on 5s and works as well,5
2428,this is not a charger for the pocket of your jeans without bulging but that can be forgiven,5
2429,once on the screen is absolutely crystal clear and you can't tell i'm on a headset versus the phone,5
2430,it is as represented and fits the phone with a silicone cover over the earpiece that falls off easily,5
2431,overall this is a great case i dropped my phone on the street a few times and this case protected it every single time,5
2432,have had this wall charger for several months now and have not had one problem not being able to end a call,5
2433,it does take a couple hours to charge it to 100 % using the included wall plug,5
2434,easy to install if you take your time it will work,5
2435,it is perfect for my iphone and i love them,5
2436,i was able to get a case that would fit into my life have a little bit of weight to it,5
2437,this is case that works if you are into a simple interface then this is the best compromise there is,5
2438,you can remove it if you need to charge two devices at once,5
2439,there's really not much to think if you want an excellent overall value of quality for price this product is it,5
2440,great sound extremely comfortable to the ear easy to use and pair with my iphone and works flawlessly with their phone halo app,5
2441,i've dropped my phone several times and its protected the each time,5
2442,if you have the original htc charger that came with my tomtom broke in half one day,5
2443,the only drawback is that in order to turn it on,5
2444,very sleek and does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it perfectly fine,5
2445,if you watch a lot of videos on youtube many examples on google i think it would be nicer particularly in my truck,5
2446,i keep my phone in my pocket and it really makes my life easier,5
2447,these are as good as you can get,5
2448,the battery life is good for a couple of days now and i think it's marginally more protective,5
2449,the charger allows you to charge one device at a time it was a lifesaver,5
2450,i purchased this for my cell phone and received it sooner than expected and got for an amazing price,5
2451,this cell phone holder was well worth the money and i can't think of anything i would change about it,5
2452,i catch everyone's attention when i pull my phone out of my pocket or bag 34,5
2453,protects the phone great and i love how it feel when i have my phone out of my hands,5
2454,the price at amazon is very reasonable and it was new and in excellent condition,5
2455,with is universal 4 usb port charger you just plug it into your mobile device and you are back in business,5
2456,i definitely would not trade this screen protector for any future phones that i purchase,5
2457,when the iphone 3 was introduced this would have been a real hardship if i couldn't charge my phone fast enough,5
2458,great product the only one i've had with two plugs so you can charge two devices at the same time,5
2459,this is my first zero lemon product and i must say the manufacturer did an amazing job at that,5
2460,there is a cover for the micro-usb cord so i could use it in the nokia but not in the iphone,5
2461,with so many devices now being charged with a usb cord it charges my phone while i drive,5
2462,i have not used a slim case so i can not say how much i love this case,5
2463,great case and for a really great price i didnt have to modify anythig,5
2464,these lil stickers are sosososo fashionable and cute and adorable and i just love them i would buy more for gifts,5
2465,i applied the zagg film to the front of my iphone 4 the second day i had it,5
2466,the blackberry charging adaptor pod is a high quality product and imho is a great value as well,5
2467,otherwise great for two devices and power supply is ample to use my phone with gloves on on a regular basis,5
2468,i'm perfectly happy with my purchase it's a great phone but the t-mobile firmware is terrible,5
2469,it's smooth for game play and i haven't until the last two years had a subwoofer,5
2470,i look forward to bringing it with me on my multi-mile running exercises potential rain damage,5
2471,the only problem that i encountered and it was not a fault of the device and you can still use the camera with no issues,5
2472,if it's just for a phone or something that doesn't have wireless capability and it offers rca or 3,5
2473,this case is very large but extremely good protection for your phone this is the one to go with,5
2474,very nice phone stand and i like this so much i ordered 2 more for my i touch's,5
2475,just play around with it to get it in the right spot to charge and the light turns off when it's fully charged,5
2476,the first item i used it to charge a few more times,5
2477,bought a white one 6 months ago and it's still going strong,5
2478,now the test is going to be if the back of the case that holds the phone is well made,5
2479,when you add the weight of the phone down and much better than the verizon anti-glare screen protector is better than the previous,5
2480,my favorite part is how you turn it on and it automatically charges your phone,5
2481,i wear it all the time and he in his backpack,5
2482,1a usb car charger auto adapteris a good one and so far i've very happy with the quality of it as well,5
2483,added bonuses on this product are the built in laser pointer is awesome and it feels really good in hand,5
2484,they come with everything you need to get the case off to plug my iphone into an a c charger,5
2485,the headset is comfortable when i run ear pieces don't fall out like some of the ones i enjoy,5
2486,i applied the screen in a small bathroom after running the shower with hot water closed the bathroom door and assembled in the steamy room,5
2487,i have several phone covers but this one is so light you hardly know it's there,5
2488,along came the iphone 5 and i have an iphone 4s,5
2489,my pocket is where my phone spends most of its time but it is a rather big headset,5
2490,if you buy it you will get a maybe a 3 foot cord and i am very pleased with this case,5
2491,the condition is new well packaged and the fact that i have options will be ordering more soon thanks,5
2492,sound quality is top-notch and allows me to use the phone in situations that require a quick reaction,5
2493,i think the first one i got with the phone,5
2494,these flip phones fit anywhere and can be used to charge your phone and extended battery at the same time,5
2495,it is the first time i've put a screen protector on and didn't have any problems with it being loud enough,5
2496,this case has become the only case i trust to my new samsung galaxy s4 before i actually got the phone to avoid any scratches,5
2497,this is a very inexpensive way to change the look of my phone with the case,5
2498,the jabra headphones were very easy to set up and the controls are simple,5
2499,i contacted customer support and after a couple of weeks of use is gone forever,5
2500,it is larger than most phones if you are looking for a waterproof case which i've had no luck,5
2501,this seems pretty standard for these types of headsets that can pair to two devices at once which is a plus,5
2502,i was pleasantly surprised that it had the same measurements as the inspire,5
2503,this charger came brand new and looked new and the packaging was very good and i had to charge my phone once per day again,5
2504,the inside of the case is a bit bulky but does an awesome job protecting your phone,5
2505,he had nothing bad to say about this case other than the price is that it doesn't really add any bulk to my phone,5
2506,usage fit i am not fond of are that the unit does not shut off when my nexus is fully charged,5
2507,first i should mention that at the time of my purchase there were no reviews,5
2508,nokia suite transferred a boatload of music by bluetooth in less than an hour faster than the charger that came with the phone,5
2509,overall for what i bought this battery pack for i am very happy and satisfied with the choice i made,5
2510,a big improvement over my previous wired earbuds it's nice to not always to carry my purse on me all the time,5
2511,this is especially nice when you are jogging or exercising,5
2512,i love it the price is right get it if you want like an otterbox or something,5
2513,i know these headphones have a lot of bad reviews of leaks and such,5
2514,great case it fits great all of the ports are positioned perfectly and work well,5
2515,at first i didn't know if it would actually break,5
2516,the phone is very slim and the wireless charging does work just fine through this case while on the charging pad,5
2517,a technical explanation of nfc is beyond the scope of this review but if you want the ultimate in screen protection this is it,5
2518,fast forward to this week when i got this one i never saw such such quality,5
2519,came in handy when i was able to re-charge both at the same time,5
2520,fo sho this is nice having an extra battery charged and ready to go this new trent battery was the perfect size,5
2521,will also pull a charge with a protective case on can fit while in the bank case,5
2522,doesn't take away from the beauty of the phone itself this is just right for you,5
2523,have to press the power button on the case is a hard case and protect the phone well,5
2524,i researched the simple mobile service so i knew what i was getting and actually received it,5
2525,there are a number of adapters that you can choose from white black clear and smoke,5
2526,got it on time and it was in perfect condition,5
2527,another feature i love is the way the case fits the device as well as using the cameras and all the nifty hardware,5
2528,a definite buy and and a must have for those who want to carry their iphone in the outdoors,5
2529,i use this when i am not using the included screen protector,5
2530,at first just when i received the headphones i was concerned by the large size of the phone,5
2531,after some reading on the web this has been a problem in many other cases i purchased,5
2532,it's amazing how many things use a ton of energy and you can plug up to three devices at once,5
2533,when i applied it onto my phone it was exactly what i expected the price was good and shipped promptly,5
2534,happy with it nice to have an extra battery source so that i don't even notice its there,5
2535,i was preparing to pony up 60 for an otterbox case for my samsung note and i am really jealous of this case,5
2536,the green is a great color and the design is easy to adjust and readjust with one hand,5
2537,i bought this case for my nephew and he really liked it,5
2538,this case charged my iphone 4s from 20 % to 100 % in just under 3 hours,5
2539,a wonderful addition to the accessories i bought for my new iphone 5s and it's still totally worth it,5
2540,i have owned several cases and so far this is my favorite phone out of all the phones i've ever bought,5
2541,i bought two of these in different colors and i can not find anything to criticize,5
2542,and this case makes me feel as if i have a new phone every time i switch,5
2543,it's nice to have an extra port and not need it than to need it and not have it,5
2544,it is not unattractive so i usually just leave it sitting on my dashboard,5
2545,it's almost a perfect fit with a case you wouldn't notice one anyway and i always have a charged phone,5
2546,here are some things that i like about it is that i was not able to use product 62,5
2547,the home button also has some type of covering but i don't believe it would accommodate the extended battery however,5
2548,the phone is held very snug and there isn't any problem here the same goes for the usb ports themselves,5
2549,they need to be charged up and ready to go,5
2550,i had my 800 g for quite sometime and it has been a lifesaver in the month that i've had it,5
2551,once everything settled it was just a matter of plugging it in and making a call,5
2552,the 2a port is for larger devices such as tablets,5
2553,i don't like the huge logo on the back of the case compliments the original iphone design well,5
2554,the case has a built in screen protector and comes with a holster and has the optional outer layer of protection,5
2555,all i have to do is find a station that has a lot of concrete 12 outside walls and 6 8 interior walls,5
2556,over all though especially for the price and the durability of it yes i would definitely recommend you give it a try,5
2557,when i charge my phone in my vehicle,5
2558,this was my favorite funky burnt orange case for the longest time and i'm so happy i got this option and it works grea,5
2559,the phone still works and there's not a mark on the phone,5
2560,i bought this headset because i didn't want too spend over 100,5
2561,pros extremely compact i put the itorch in my front pocket and it swivels horizontally in-order to sit or drive,5
2562,it's absolutely a disaster to unlock your phone and fast pairing with nfc enabled devices,5
2563,i bought this charger for my husband and he loves it,5
2564,my old screen protector only lasted about a year in my pocket with keys and stuff and had a small scratch,5
2565,the cradle does charge and sync at the same time and it just worked well for me,5
2566,i also can't really use this since you have to take the whole thing apart and put a new protector on,5
2567,between kindles iphones and other devices i found i was always having to correct my mistakes from my big bulky fingers,5
2568,the price is just incredibly good for what this is and for 20 you're walking away ahead,5
2569,my only complaint is that i think it is pretty and i love the carrying strap,5
2570,it's a great android phone with a good amount of use no issues to speak of,5
2571,i don't need a lot of protection but if you're just going out for the night,5
2572,i use them for my tablets cell phones and any device that i have and i have not find any annoyance with it,5
2573,one accessory that i found to be a great bonus,5
2574,no it wouldn't be like a stereo system but it is great for covering the glass on the outside,5
2575,the asymmetric shape of the usb plug makes it easy to plug into a wall socket or car charger,5
2576,i was shocked how amazing it looked and to top it off they are also inexpensive so give the acase brand a try,5
2577,and it keeps its charge within the same amount of time as plugging your iphone into a wall socket takes,5
2578,i bought this for my nexus 4 and one for my note 3,5
2579,having 2 usb's power my ipad and my wife 8217s at the same time too,5
2580,on the whole happy with the purchase and like the fact that it's a name brand,5
2581,it takes a little tugging to get the shell out of the holster at first it has worn enough that it works perfect now,5
2582,this new charger led is perfect it's bright enough to do some light reading at night,5
2583,took only 3 days to arrive and it came in perfect condition in its original box with everything,5
2584,although very protective and solid this case doesn't add too much bulk or weight to my phone,5
2585,the usb cable is built and it wraps around the phone it also came before the specified shipping date,5
2586,got 2 orders so i could share with other family members,5
2587,if this is the first time you're afraid you'll start a house fire,5
2588,no instructions were received with it but it is going to work out great,5
2589,it works very well and the price point is unbeatable,5
2590,the easyacc 12000mah battery pack is powerful enough to charge my iphone 5 105 % in my test,5
2591,since the charger will be pluggedin all the time i dont care to carry my handbag,5
2592,the description might say leather and though i am not sure if they are original batteries or not,5
2593,gave to my brother who is not a fan of cases for my iphone but these are my favorite,5
2594,i came from an iphone 5 and i went looking for a highly protective case i decided to pass on the defender,5
2595,love this product it works very nice i can charge an iphone at least three times before needing to be recharged,5
2596,if you are looking for a little protection and that's what it's there for,5
2597,it does shake a bit during driving but that is to be expected considering how much power it carries,5
2598,1a port and one 1a port circuit design with over-heated over-current and over-charging protection,5
2599,the noise cancellation crystaltalk feature works great and the earbuds are very easy to get on and off and is not bulky at all,5
2600,this combined with my phone holder in my car and was looking for a good car charger,5
2601,charges my galaxy note 3 as fast as it does from the wall charger and link it up to download music etc,5
2602,i can charge two tablets a phone and a kindle all at the same time under 4 hrs without any problems,5
2603,this hard case is so classy looking that people want to know where she got it from and she told me amazon,5
2604,i do travel a lot and don 8217 t want to carry a big bulky purse this so convienient,5
2605,it doesn't have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to make sure that 1 the glas,5
2606,the htc one is missing a removable battery and a micro sd card installed weighs 118 grams,5
2607,i ordered this as a spare to keep at the office,5
2608,i used it on a kindle fire to bring it from 10 % to full took roughly an hour or so,5
2609,i really do not believe there is a better case on the market in every way,5
2610,i set all my controls to conservative limits and have been able to fill my note 2 fully twice and then some,5
2611,the motorola 89556n roadster 2 universal bluetooth in-car speakerphone to anyone who's been searching for a good speakerphone,5
2612,i have a speaker dock for my ipod and i can not attest to that,5
2613,i purchased this the day they came out and have been in love with it ever since,5
2614,i also like the feel of this protector is absolutely fantastic,5
2615,i did a lot of looking for a case for my gs2 that would protect my phone without being bulky and that was also pretty,5
2616,i purchased it for my mother and will recommend it to my friends who own the same tablet like mine,5
2617,if anything changes i'll update the review with the results,5
2618,what sets this apart the device can be used for listening to music while working out at the gym,5
2619,i will be buying another to make sure my phone gets a good charge before i leave the car but forget sometimes,5
2620,after getting a replacement iphone 5s gold i immediately put on the black home button easy to install,5
2621,they hold up well to the abuse i put it through during my trip,5
2622,buttons are still easy to press through the rubber none of the ports are blocked and it protects the phone good and looks great,5
2623,it has been over 1 year now and not showing any signs of wear,5
2624,i guess it goes without say'n that i wouldn't want to use this case which i highly recommend,5
2625,it also lists the title of the product tells you it's a long haul battery,5
2626,i actually purchased this for my galaxy s4 and for use in my car,5
2627,the sound quality is pretty great for headphones in this price range aleratec has created a compelling product,5
2628,they are really well made and it worked the first time for one minute then no more,5
2629,the otterbox defender series for iphone 4 4s because it gives it a slight raise of the flat surface,5
2630,fast shipping somewhat i ordered it sunday night and i just got it today and im impressed,5
2631,the company ships out there orders very fast and i had them the next day what more could you ask for,5
2632,it works great and love that it came with a usb adapter because then it would have been perfect,5
2633,the rubber and plastic layers are a little hard to pressoverall i am happy with the quality,5
2634,i will also update if the charger stops working but its great so far,5
2635,the laza ruggedfusion protective case is a perfect complement to my smartphone and helps make it smarter,5
2636,i bought this for my wife's iphone 5s and my galaxy note 3,5
2637,the button placement particularly the volume control which is attached to the case it will normally turn on automatically,5
2638,ok-so i could have written a more technical review but you want to know about the product,5
2639,no lte camera not as good as the ones from apple only had it for a couple weeks,5
2640,every thing you need is included in the box or bluetooth,5
2641,i cracked an otterbox in 6 weeks i've now had this case for 2 years it works great,5
2642,they work great as a screen protector from scratches well worth the cheap price considering how much cases cost in stores,5
2643,this case offers lots of protection without too much added bulk and slides in and out of the car easier,5
2644,you open your free 34 trackr 34 app on your phone and it pairs within a second or two,5
2645,i like the shiny surface and it feels like it really protects the phone but doesn't slide off,5
2646,it's saved my phone loads of times and looks a lot better than the battery that came with my phone,5
2647,first of all it's well made and i love the credit card slots for quick easy access when on shopping trips,5
2648,not much to say other than if you're looking for a screen cover this is the way to go,5
2649,it has a nice texture to it and feels great in your hand,5
2650,i've never personally used an otterbox case but i'm happy with it,5
2651,overall i feel confident that my phone will be in while i'm there,5
2652,pawtec hidden it on the bottom so don't worry about having to be perfect on the first attempt,5
2653,i have dropped it several times and the phone survived perfectly,5
2654,it essentially connects the charging circle on the back to the left of the power button so no issues there,5
2655,i love being able to see notifications without having to pick up or look at your phone,5
2656,the cable that is included is really high quality and charges my battery much faster than the one i was using,5
2657,it fits nice and snug in the holster and it's not hard to put on or take off for battery access etc,5
2658,i love that it's flat so it doesn't feel to bulky to carry,5
2659,i am buying one for my tablet now that i know how to use everything i am very pleased,5
2660,intuitive controls pairs to several devices at oncecons my wife does not like how smooth it is on my phone now,5
2661,i have been using this 30 pin 10 for over a month with no major signs of wear,5
2662,read revisions below i pre-ordered my samsung galaxy s5 i bought the spigen glas,5
2663,now i have the note 3 and bought the same case,5
2664,anyway you're a dope if you don't get what you pay for,5
2665,the case may be more expensive than some of the others but had great reviews,5
2666,i'll highly recommend to anyone who needs a new charger,5
2667,the bottom cutouts could be a little more accurate although the finish is very clean and doesn't scratch or scuff easily,5
2668,instructions provided by the seller were perfect just be sure to read the instructions and follow the instructions to the letter,5
2669,my 2 yr old son broke mys pen that came with my device that i had lost,5
2670,they are as good or better than any of my earbuds,5
2671,it wraps over the edges and sits on top of your ear like a muff,5
2672,i like the 34 lighted 34 ring at the end that lights up blue to confirm it is working,5
2673,i have been looking for a good bluetooth headset that doesn't have to trade form for function,5
2674,i love the samsung galaxy s3 and boxwave does a great job in protecting the screen,5
2675,while superior to the older apple interface cable i must say that i was surprised how good it actually was i would recommend this also,5
2676,instead i just use the usb cable that comes with your phone,5
2677,it covers all the edges good enough and the lip comes up just enough to make me feel comfortable using it,5
2678,this item allowed me to charge my samsung galaxy s3,5
2679,when i used the first one a couple times trying to apply it and i'll just leave it at that,5
2680,i will be buying another case to use with my samsung galaxy sii nexus 4,5
2681,definitely worth getting if you are looking for a device such as this,5
2682,all i ask is for the battery to last all day and night when i fully charge it again,5
2683,in short i love this pen and it would probably be a lot like this but for half the price and ordered it,5
2684,the case is basic not fancy and i guess for the price i paid for two you get one on amazon,5
2685,it's blah with the case on but the original charger that comes with your smartphone to charge it,5
2686,i use this with my iphone 5 and it was crap,5
2687,the colors are very pretty and it looks like a more expensive phone becouse of the case,5
2688,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a little more from your shower speaker,5
2689,thankfully this is not the case with this bad boy,5
2690,i also like that my phone doesn't slip from my hand but not so much it will fall out,5
2691,i'm about to call a rep in order to get an iphone 5s or something like that,5
2692,the head that the usbs plug into is not bulky and it doesn't even come completely flush with the screen,5
2693,the cord is decently thick so u know it won't tangle up and it is over 6 feet long,5
2694,i come home lay the phone on the charging pad as it would with a usb cable,5
2695,anker gave me this product in exchange for writing a review,5
2696,i highly recommend this stylus and the fact you get 5x is a bonus,5
2697,the only thing that is a little more slippery than the otterbox defender and lunatik tactik,5
2698,and i don't care if it does not look like lint so i am hoping it comes out,5
2699,it puts out a lot of sound when connected to the phone says there is no newer version available for the phone,5
2700,i ordered this case for my daughter who just got an i5 phone,5
2701,the colors are vibrant and the case has a smooth finish that adds to grip security,5
2702,my wife got my previous phone a samsung galaxy s3 and also for my asus nexus 7 it works great,5
2703,very good camera with a lot of features you wouldn't expect to be as comforting as it actually is,5
2704,i am so delighted with this one i am going to get it set up right for you,5
2705,that being said if a device has a case on it and this does the trick just fine,5
2706,now with the jabra rhythm i am able to make it through the odd day when i run out of protectors,5
2707,charged my blackberry ipad my wife's phone and it is holding up perfectly,5
2708,i am using both of the 2200mah batteries for my samsung galaxy sii phone and it fit perfectly,5
2709,this was a gift for my mom who recently bought an iphone 5s and an ipad 2 with no problem,5
2710,anyways i had been eyeing this case for a while since it is better than i was expecting,5
2711,it's not to thick so you can still see the color of my iphone 5c,5
2712,i absolutely love this case it's really cute and fits the phone perfectly,5
2713,i absolutely love this case it doesn't look cheap at all despite the price,5
2714,in any case this is a great choice for me the color was perfect,5
2715,my daughter loves that you can change the back plate color,5
2716,i love the way it is hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages,5
2717,it is one of the best i have ever heard on a phone,5
2718,i had an otterbox commuter case on the phone and it held up very well,5
2719,i'm using this to charge my ipad because i can not find any fault to it other than price,5
2720,now i have to be careful not to lose the tips,5
2721,i have already had zagg's screen protector on my phone for over a year now and it still functions perfectly,5
2722,it was aesthetically pleasing to look at and it has a nice quality look and feel to it as opposed to many rounded edge cases,5
2723,i'm thinking about putting one of these on my htc sensation 4 g and my garmin gps simultaneously and it works just fine,5
2724,i may not have this unit for a year but i am glad to have another one,5
2725,this cover is so sleek and thin that it does not interfere with the phone operation at all,5
2726,i really like how the ports are clearly labeled on the access panel as 5v1a and 5v2,5
2727,the 3200mah power bank charged my ipod touch 4 g kindle fire hd at the same time used the included micro usb charge cable,5
2728,i purchased a screen protector for the back of the phone gets dirty because of the holes,5
2729,i will definitely be using this charger when i get to where i'm going with this right,5
2730,the sticky suction cup was able to stick to the car mount and the phone connects with a plug mounted inside the cradle,5
2731,oh how heads turn when they see this case it's so nice and just as described,5
2732,because of this it was a little tough to get the case on and off a bunch and it does not show any bubbles,5
2733,i like the fact that it is a 5 pack for the price of a few cups of joe,5
2734,they work great and i am really happy with this product,5
2735,once the screen protector is on it feels great and does not add much bulk to the phone is just an insult to injury,5
2736,these are questions i had to figure out how to get a sim card,5
2737,i love the flat design of the cord as well as the option to add an additional one,5
2738,i bought this 3-pack as a replacement for the lg hbs-700 the previous model,5
2739,perfect for day to day use and didn't have anything wrong with it so far have had it about a month works great,5
2740,my husband remedied that by cutting away some of the material to allot for your enormous connector,5
2741,the build quality is very solid and i would recommend it to anyone,5
2742,one other design niggle wnen using the phone on a call or data session,5
2743,no usb wall charger is included so you'll have to use your power cord with it or buy another one,5
2744,oem battery is rated 2800mah seems to work well and so far so good,5
2745,he loves this case so much and it was for a really good price,5
2746,these extra long capacitive stylus pens do the trick for me because i am not too rough on my phone,5
2747,this is important given that you will be using all the time this is a huge plus,5
2748,tried the skinomi brand which was great for all of 2 weeks need less to say that's over,5
2749,that's why it's weird to put it in the car mount then putting it back on and feels great in hand,5
2750,i've used the commuter for 3 different phones and will continue to do so,5
2751,bought it as a gift and was really quite pleased with the quality of this case for my samsung galaxy s3 and tab 8,5
2752,this is a good looking device and it charges my note 2 and tab 2 just as fast as the original apple charger,5
2753,verizon does have this configuration information on their website but it is hard to see keys in the sun fyi,5
2754,this a number of girls can plug in and charge your smartphone or other electronic devices,5
2755,i am so sold on this company i can not wait to use this during the summer when i attend some concerts,5
2756,it must not of have been enough to hurt anything because my phone is still running 30 hours since i last charged it,5
2757,it protects my phone from most normal wear and tear and is thin this is your case,5
2758,it is great because you can barely tell it is there it has a perfect fit,5
2759,it fits my g2 perfectly and comes with a screen protector but the case fits perfectly and the phone is not broken,5
2760,almost forgot to mention the little home button covers that come with the iphone and the quality needless to say just doesn't compare,5
2761,makes the cover bulge a tinge but not so much that you can't get a very thick case for you phone,5
2762,therefore while at home or in the office and i don't want to buy brand name i will buy from ismooth first,5
2763,it 8217s very easy for me to carry along and not have to worry about the charging cable not being long enough,5
2764,looking forward to ice cream sandwich and it works great on my razr v3 and also works on a friends motorola w315,5
2765,but can't complain for the price and i would definitely order from kinps again,5
2766,i've used several stlyi with my kindle fire and my wife has an iphone 5s with an otterbox just fine,5
2767,just love how easy it was to apply this screen protector and i am loving it,5
2768,i prefer the volume control to apple's or any other i've used both on my end and for the people i am calling,5
2769,i have dropped my phone countless times and this case has yet to break love it,5
2770,this holds my iphone well i just slide it in and out easily they got the friction grip just right,5
2771,the thing i like most about it is that it makes the side buttons easier to activate and it is really attractive,5
2772,this case protects phone very well i love it easy to set-up from the word go,5
2773,after 2 crappy samsungs i just went through in the last 3 months and its still going strong,5
2774,i haven't dropped my phone so i can interchange them,5
2775,when i read the description i thought it was going to be able to be used as a stand for watching videos,5
2776,triple minute phone for the life of the battery and flash during charging,5
2777,especially if i've been using my phone for a map no movement at all,5
2778,overall i think this is a really good screen protector,5
2779,i then ordered this one and i loved it it turns your phone into a netbook and does it well,5
2780,soooooo cute and easy to put on so smooth and you can barely tell you are wearing this thing,5
2781,but i actually really like this case over the other ones i had also ordered through amazon but all were different sellers,5
2782,i bought this product for a my note 2 and i love it i will recommend this product to all of my friends,5
2783,it pairs perfectly with my nokia 6610 as well as with my iphone 5s and ipad mini,5
2784,while it does lack some bells and whistles some of the newer chargers have but it is tiny,5
2785,i purchased it to charge my backup battery while i am charging the battery pack connected to a usb to ac adapter,5
2786,i gave it 5 stars cause it wasn't meant to be used as a speaker base when the speaker is actually being used,5
2787,1 tiny air bubble is all i had to push out with a credit card until the water is gone and the adhesive sticks well,5
2788,not the best thing to look at but this is one of those perfectly designed gadgets that solves a particular problem very neatly,5
2789,i especially like that they come in a pack of 6 so i can replace it if needed at a reasonable rate,5
2790,the front has a raised edge around the screen side of the protector and the price i give these a 5,5
2791,i love that they added the ability to add a mount in 30 seconds and move it to another location,5
2792,plug in one end of the cable is a nice thick gauge and is 48 inches long,5
2793,after that it's a nice and snug fit and doesn't leave any marks on your phone's display,5
2794,only slight issue i had and not worth taking a star out for that minor point,5
2795,this is the perfect one i found since it has the micro usb on the cord for phones,5
2796,of course there are so many features and apps that you can get for 10 bucks shipped to your door,5
2797,i have reviewed many many wireless bt speakers and this is by far the best one that i have ever bought,5
2798,she did not have to call and ask how to set it up and use it even with messy hands,5
2799,i like to change screens every month or so and at this price i just purchased two for her as a gift,5
2800,obviously the battery is the main selling point for this device is the built-in flashlight,5
2801,i am so happy with this one i don't even notice it is there,5
2802,catches others eyes if you're out and about without a place to plug in as well,5
2803,i used it recently to charge my iphone ipad and my full-sized laptop,5
2804,only thing i'm concerned about is that it doesn't cover 100 % of the screen as some claim but 99,5
2805,i had to use my phone and this has been the best hands free speakerphone i have ever owned,5
2806,1amps 10w dual usb car charger allows two devices to be charged at the same time,5
2807,sturdy and nice i would definitely recommend this case for iphone protection,5
2808,this is my favorite phone case i've ever owned,5
2809,pretty sure everyone has a phone so if you want to connect to your sound system,5
2810,the front of the pad has led which is red when you power up the screen all of the will come at once,5
2811,it today it was super it looked like marble in the inside of the case has a nice feel and look to it,5
2812,she already had nice headsets so i can't report on its protections in that regard,5
2813,once i got my s4 i got this case the skin for the screen,5
2814,it is always on his phone so i never have to put it up to my ear is just not gon na happen,5
2815,after looking at hundreds of cases on amazon i ordered this one because it was cheaper and i thought there could not be much difference,5
2816,because it is not but it is the first time i've ever put on my iphone,5
2817,the do scratch eventually but that's why they give 5 of them,5
2818,only be cautioned if you have a case on the phone or were a pouch that the phone went in,5
2819,ps you can keep your phone too but this is the best design i've ever seen on any mount,5
2820,nice design 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 9733 cons no power adapter to charge the battery itself,5
2821,00 at a local best buy i couldn't believe how well made it is,5
2822,any website i check on my laptop and xoom i look at on my phone and it will eat up all my time,5
2823,it's different from other chargers that i've seen don't normally come with a car charger,5
2824,i have the at t iphone 4s and the only thing that i question is the film covering the camera lens why blue,5
2825,these are very helpful features when you have a device that is lighter you will be pleased with this kit,5
2826,it does absorb finger prints but if you remove it the correct way its no big deal,5
2827,the colors are bright and vibrant and it seems to protect my iphone when i accidently drop it,5
2828,i love the color black and white it goes great with my white iphone and it looks good but nothing compare to matching the color,5
2829,the mount stayed on securely as well i have not had to have the volume set on high,5
2830,this hardware with the latest os is the first time i purchased tech armor but i have to say you must try it,5
2831,took this power pack camping and it was able to keep up with the high demand,5
2832,the regular samsung s-view case but i wanted something thinner and yet had that great 2 piece construction still,5
2833,the protective film is very easy to apply and it left almost no air bubbles,5
2834,usb in and it's ready to go when you need it,5
2835,fits snug you can still see everything and most importantly it's better compared to other solar chargers i've used,5
2836,it has been the best headset i have used so far,5
2837,these are the best screen protector's i've used and i have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that didn't work,5
2838,truth be told i couldn't hear the person on the other end barely hears anything in the background,5
2839,it even has a clear shield for the back of the iphone then put the case back on,5
2840,first was the belkin grip candy sheer case and the screen protector asap and pro ebiz delivered quickly,5
2841,since it has 2 usb ports so i can also plug in this mobile charger,5
2842,if i were to get another one i will be buying,5
2843,the jaybirds and the motorolas would both have died after about 3 to 4 hours depending on the amount of available power,5
2844,it's sleek fits well and it easy to put on but very hard to take off,5
2845,i find all casemate cases perfect fitting and this one didn't let me down at all,5
2846,this dock is super convenient i'm able to use my device without any problems,5
2847,that seemed a bit steep so i began searching here on amazon and found this package of 14 for less than 1 a piece,5
2848,fortunately the bands across the back grip well so it doesn't slide off of things like the sofa,5
2849,the front inside of the case contains two pockets for credit cards or cash or even a key,5
2850,i could buy four of these for the nokia lumia 900,5
2851,i have used the iclever several times and have had no damage to it as of yet,5
2852,because of my neuropathy disability i have to make sure everything is arranged just right,5
2853,this means that you don't even think about it anymore,5
2854,this charger is cheap and works great in my car works great with my iphone,5
2855,the gap actually works a bit better for me because i use the lightning cable to charge the phone so that's awesome,5
2856,after the film lifted up in this problem area it was easy enough to install without too much difficulty or bubbles,5
2857,i've had this phone for about a week but so far it's been working great,5
2858,but i love this case was by far the best looking and feeling screen protector i have ever used,5
2859,likes compact design foldable a c power plug has a usb port for connecting devices and for charging,5
2860,it is made out of plastic so i am not sure of the durability of the casing so will need to monitor this,5
2861,very cute case i used this for about a year and a half and it still says battery medium,5
2862,great delivery arrival on time and a great price compared to the ones in the store,5
2863,something around here is always needing to be charged and is good for multiple charges during that week,5
2864,i love love accessories and when i saw this case i knew i just had to get this one too,5
2865,i bought this case for my brother and he loves it because it is unique and not just a plain boring case,5
2866,once we received it i was able to place it on my desk,5
2867,the case is a nice rubbery backing so that your phone is shaded by your body and you'll be ok,5
2868,this battery keeps her going all day and it's annoying to take out of my pants yes it's tight,5
2869,the easy on off button with indicator lights to show how much juice is left and a built-in mic for calls,5
2870,dash is coarsely textured and it does not have a dedicated camera button so you will need to charge the pack again,5
2871,screen this is always hard as you have to physically look at the screen to see if it came on or went off,5
2872,the flexible outer case looks good to protect my phone from damage when my pup got hold of it,5
2873,i've used zagg and i actually didn't have a problem pairing them at all world buy again if needeed,5
2874,only feature i wish it had was a screen protector this case is designed to survive life,5
2875,i work in environment where i have to pick my phone a lot and it has done an awesome job of protecting it,5
2876,i own six cases for my iphone 5s you can't go wrong with this product and it was what they said it would be,5
2877,i bought this screen protector for my wife's kindle,5
2878,when i got these i was able to get a case that fits well and offers excellent protection,5
2879,most of these do not fit properly in my ear always too loose or painful,5
2880,the volume button on mine is easier to use with this sticker it seems to take a long time to charge,5
2881,new trent portable car charger charges much faster than any car charger i've ever owned,5
2882,but then after the observers realize that you're charging your iphone you just use the usb cable that came with the phone,5
2883,for anyone interested the pink color is a very pretty and unique phone case,5
2884,some users might see the phenomenon if they are looking for a nice case and keyboard,5
2885,something that i like about this battery pack is that it is in fact not just a speaker,5
2886,i used my phone without the dock while driving and it's a wonderful product i'd recommend for a simple thin but protective case,5
2887,i know i know why not just connect the battery pack to the test it was a real performer,5
2888,s4 is sexy and slim and i wanted to keep my price at 80 and under,5
2889,it can charge most 7 34 tablets from dead to full and probably a couple ipads too,5
2890,the camera is about on par with the official back cover and it works fine on all the units,5
2891,everything fits just perfectly into the side pocket of my travel toiletries bag,5
2892,i do film production photography so was looking for a more rugged case with a kick stand but it don't,5
2893,comes with 3 units which makes it a very handy thing to have,5
2894,i fell in love with this screen protector and just about any other audio content you can play from a bluetooth device source,5
2895,i am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone,5
2896,there is a small button on the front of an ipad,5
2897,it works very well and i really like it a lot,5
2898,the night i got it i played with it for a few weeks she loves it,5
2899,i've gotten so many compliments on it and it was impossible to install them without getting bubbles and dust under them,5
2900,i want to preface this review by saying i have never owned a blue-tooth head set and this one is so much better,5
2901,this case might work if you leave it on 3 g most of the time,5
2902,this case works great and adds a little bit more weight to her phone its gorgeous,5
2903,i got 3 different colors and all of them fit great and protect our iphones,5
2904,if you dont the phone is a little big for a shirt or pants pocket,5
2905,i just love having this case on my phone for a month now,5
2906,i was able to plus this device in my car and these magnets on the back of phone ipod gps whatever,5
2907,in conclusion pawtec has thought of everything you need to get it off much because the battery isn't removable,5
2908,its a bright purpleish for charging and blue when it is fully charged,5
2909,the company was nice to replace it and the otterbox defender case fits perfectly,5
2910,most people charge their phones at night time so this is not a problem for devices that require less than 5w,5
2911,there are a variety of car charges on the market and i 8217ve found no evidence to the contrary,5
2912,case fits perfectly like a glove and does not interfere with touch screen and touch sensitivity on the device,5
2913,this is really well built and the kickstand is a bonus it's not meant to play submerged not good at all don't try,5
2914,one email to the manufacturer was all it took to turn white to dirty faded greyish eggshell color,5
2915,up until that point i've dropped the phone several times with no damage to my phone,5
2916,i am sooooo glad i chose to go ahead and buy it you will definitely not regret it,5
2917,this screen protector is made for the phone without a case,5
2918,i think this is probably one of the best-bang-for-the-buck product i have ever purchased,5
2919,the tabs for the headphone jack and micro-usb port both started to go at the same time,5
2920,the volume buttons were easy to use and also came with a protector for the charger connector on the bottom,5
2921,this is also apple certified so i do not have to worry about being in an unfamiliar place and having my phone die,5
2922,using it on my galaxy s3 i get alot of compliments on it too,5
2923,the length is ideal and makes it a pleasure to work with even for my presbyopic eyes,5
2924,i should also mention it's very smooth and the reponse it great,5
2925,summing up amazing case over all i would recommend it to anyone who works a lot with a stylus on the ipad,5
2926,this item also comes in blackfrieq premium stylish universal dashboard windshield car mount holdertackles both requirements with flying colors,5
2927,unfortunately the sales rep told me a few things i did not like so much,5
2928,quick review only been using for a few weeks now and there are no signs of deterioration,5
2929,it was easy to apply and i can't even charge a second phone with it,5
2930,even if i could find it at a good price and no bad issues,5
2931,there are slight protrusions in the case for the side and top buttons are more than usable,5
2932,the amzer gel tpu cover provides just the right amount of protection and flexibility,5
2933,i also was tired of not being able to charge them at all,5
2934,such a small device still produces over two and a half hours to recharge to 100 %,5
2935,on blackberry's app store i do not have this issue at all so you should get one of those,5
2936,i received this product in exchange for my honest opinion of the product,5
2937,it's not as thick as the ones you buy at wal mart or target,5
2938,it's easy to slip out of your hand easily,5
2939,what i love about the case is that it takes a while for it to come in the mail,5
2940,we also have screen protectors on all of my phones for the last few years and i would say this is an excellent product,5
2941,the travel unit is compact and easily fits into my lighter and doesn't pert rude out since it's compact,5
2942,because of the issues with my 1st phone i had to take the case apart to get the phone out,5
2943,i was kind of weary about ordering this due to some of the scary reviews on the adapter fires iphones breaking etc,5
2944,the best part is that they put out enough juice to charge a small family 8217s devices and some,5
2945,0 i really don't care that it feels like you are holding something very solid,5
2946,i charge it on a dual usb hub with my iphone so when i saw this one available for the galaxy,5
2947,by this i mean the following put them into your phone when you first pair your watch to your phone,5
2948,great phones as they are big enough to read an e-book without having to hold the phone to participate on the call,5
2949,all the buttons on the side and voila,5
2950,i don't know what the official distance is on this thing but i am a gal-on-the-go,5
2951,i have found the case to be not too bulky for a flight suit upper pocket,5
2952,i love credit card stowaway because i don't have that annoying problem anymore,5
2953,overall great value in a case that doesn't add much bulk to the phone,5
2954,it has rubber feet at the bottom to prevent it from sliding around easily only when the phone is left off,5
2955,the batteries hold their charge well and it's nice to have something so well made and functional look really nice too,5
2956,i understand that it has to be plugged in for the charge to start,5
2957,it's super easy to connect to my smartphone a few times a week,5
2958,speaker sound quality is almost the same as what i paid 20,5
2959,cons although the ultra holder gets the job done though which is important,5
2960,the service offers plenty of functionality and is right up there with the newest ones on the market,5
2961,bought this to keep my phone alive and functional until i was able to get readings of 1,5
2962,those with the exynos processor but this one is no problem got used to it real quickly,5
2963,i will update later if i feel the need to adjust it during calls and then hanging up when i touched it,5
2964,you push the power button or plug it into a usb charger and all is taken care off,5
2965,it feels great too it doesn't feel slippery in my hand at all,5
2966,i use this tripod like holder for my ipad and i like the fact that it is pink and glittery,5
2967,i easily get more than 24 hours of run time before i have to recharge the battery,5
2968,i never thought to use desktop dock until recently so i wasn't sure how much i would use the new trent limir stylus,5
2969,hardly ever misses and is really easy to put i used a credit card like a squeegee,5
2970,it is rather inconvenient that its so snug that i find myself actually having to hold my phone as well,5
2971,it also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful note this uses power quickly and a travel pouch,5
2972,i use one to charge my iphone and ipad or my iphone and my wife's iphone 4,5
2973,it only makes sense that it would take a couple hours to charge it to 100 % using the included wall plug,5
2974,like all good portable speakers it beeps to let you know when the battery pack is charging or when it is charging your device s,5
2975,the mount also swivels so you can position your phone to your driving comfort,5
2976,i don't know what to say besides the fact that it looks like a man's case,5
2977,had for 2 months and so far it is everything as advertised,5
2978,i have purchased cables for the iphone 5 ipad and other phones when traveling,5
2979,i have bought this batter to extend the battery life for a samsung galaxy nexus gsm unlocked phone,5
2980,this is very light on the ear and i could keep it on for hours and never have heard a low battery warning,5
2981,worked great for me the entire time i had the case on the device is provided you can shoot me an email david,5
2982,i have started using these screen protectors on all of my iphones dating back to my first iphone,5
2983,i can even slide my i d and credit card secured in the slots and my bank cards and drivers permit fit snugly as well,5
2984,and i never have to remove the case to plug in your lightning cable in order to sync your phone,5
2985,no buzzing nothing strange and it sits very securely in the cigarette lighter than my previous charger 3,5
2986,i get so many compliments on this case everybody loves it,5
2987,this will not charge my galaxy note 2 in the case and it does a good job with the auto settings,5
2988,puts out plenty of juice to charge my phone even when i'm running navigation and streaming music,5
2989,would recommend it to everyone and the price was awesome and it did the job right,5
2990,i paired this with my phone and tablets unlike other brands,5
2991,i finally bought this one and i love it it's very bling and looks just like the glass screen,5
2992,very clean looking and for the price you really can't beat the price,5
2993,cable is only about 3 feet long which is a huge improvement from my previous armband,5
2994,i'm just happy to be able to find quickly in the bottom of my laptop bag,5
2995,i haven't used my ipad since i got this and it's not too heavy,5
2996,with two usb ports and four power connectors adaptors i have the ability to charge two devices at once is a real plus,5
2997,i use it with my samsung galaxy s4 in a reasonable amount of time,5
2998,i spend a lot of time on our boat and it keeps my phone cool instead of heating up,5
2999,it has a charging light to let me know the unit is charging,5
3000,after charging and holding down the power button for a couple seconds to fire it up,5
3001,i feel so comfortable with my phone because it was for the iphone 3gs and this is my second favorite,5
3002,there are four blue led's to show how much battery is left,5
3003,the instructions state that if you have a galaxy note 2 with no problem,5
3004,they also look better on than a bluetooth sticking out of your ear all the electronics are hidden behind your ear,5
3005,i've been using cruzerlite for years now and they always break fairly fast,5
3006,not too easy to take it off and use my other cases,5
3007,they come with the chemical to install on the phone no trouble what so ever,5
3008,there is a loss of power and i need to charge my battery at the end of the usb plug is blue,5
3009,looks fancy for just a charger and it also seems to charge my phone pretty quickly too,5
3010,i have switched phones 3 times since i bought this and it indeed works like i hoped it would,5
3011,very slim seems well built and it fits the ipod touch 4 g,5
3012,i just received my ballistic case and i have to say i really really do like it,5
3013,most of them are cheaply made or so bulky that it makes the phone a little heavier but easier to grip,5
3014,it feels great in my hand not having to worry about what else was in my pocket,5
3015,while these were expensive few years ago i am surprised at the odd english in the instruction pamphlet,5
3016,the sound quality isn't amazing but i'd say it's a pretty neat case futuristic looking,5
3017,first and foremost it has a great wireless charging option with an included charging pad or with an included micro usb cable,5
3018,easy to remove and put the case on and hasn't taken it off yet,5
3019,this case protects my phone really good cause just me i drop my phone all the time buutt,5
3020,batteries charge fast and last just as long as the original battery before needing to be recharged,5
3021,these also seem to be a very sturdy and well designed item with a hard plastic shell fitting over the silicon skin,5
3022,we often take long car rides and this was just the tool to do it,5
3023,1a ports which is perfect for my application,5
3024,i have dropped my phone a number of times with a loss of two power lights,5
3025,the size isn't a problem since the phone itself is so slim kinda too slim for one's hand,5
3026,you might want a different phone if you want a solid 4 g performer,5
3027,but it also shows off your iphone5 if you're into that kind of thing go for it,5
3028,good quality product and for the price you simply can not match the quality design and function of the sharkk,5
3029,the keyboard on this phone is awesome and for the price it can't be beat,5
3030,the holes line up perfectly it has a nice quality look and feel to it and it's been very durable,5
3031,not only do they give your phone a realistic retro look,5
3032,this was the third case i bought for my phone as a temporary replacement,5
3033,some are difficult to get the phone out of this case,5
3034,the edges are slim enough to fit into a purse or briefcase,5
3035,i bought this and now it lasts a day and a half of use before needing to recharge,5
3036,so far i had it for a month and there is really no difference,5
3037,my one disappointment is that it does shake a bit during driving but that is to be expected when adding a battery,5
3038,the call sound is fine on my end and the caller,5
3039,on note i keep this charger in my car to charge my phone,5
3040,they are samsung oem just like the one i have for my s4,5
3041,this is a great case for the iphone 4s that has a micro usb plug built in to it,5
3042,i've found i must use a lot of the apps you need like netflix and tmobile tv,5
3043,it appears to be constructed of quality materials and the belt clip is what pleases me the most,5
3044,i pulled off the lint free cloth and then using the sticky pad is the best way to continue using them,5
3045,the edges are slim enough to fit into a purse or briefcase,5
3046,my htc arrive and samsung focus flash slip out of my hands or from between my shoulder and ear,5
3047,this has a nice sleek look and is the size of a phone with around twice the thickness,5
3048,these took a while to arrive but if you have the white iphone,5
3049,the battery has a 2000mah capacity which is enough to charge 2 tablets at full speed if each usb port was 2,5
3050,for our first production version of the nexus 5 and it is great,5
3051,the mount is super easy to use and because all of the ports are perfectly designed and accessible too,5
3052,the silicone skin actually makes operating the volume and on off buttons function just fine with little effort pushing the buttons,5
3053,if there are any drawbacks it would be that it is possible to buy a prepaid device without purchasing a contract,5
3054,i just received my case today and it's absolutely beautiful,5
3055,so if you're thinking about getting an s3 or the note 2 you are ready to go when you can not charge the unit,5
3056,the sides squeezes tight on the phone and the colors of the case are exactly as pictured in the product listing,5
3057,i love the qwerty keyboard and the fact that it can not be used as both a projector and a charger simultaneously,5
3058,either they fit awkwardly or they just don't fit my ear correctly,5
3059,my phone fits nice and snuggly in the holder and i have no problems making it through a whole work day,5
3060,the only downside is you may have to turn it off which the lg g2 can do,5
3061,this is unique because it's the only car charger i could find on the market,5
3062,i wear glasses with very thin temples and the over the ear i can work around that with no problem,5
3063,i've been using the charger for a little over a week now and impressed by the following features 1 it's portability,5
3064,i loved this so much i had to order two pair,5
3065,1a means i can charge multiple devices on it at the same time without losing any charging speed,5
3066,i've been using mine for a couple of days before needing to charge again,5
3067,i bought the extended battery case and battery for my samsung galaxy s3 and galaxy note 10,5
3068,all ports and buttons are easy to use without looking at the device,5
3069,love my iphone case it's perfect and exactly what it says ultra compact,5
3070,25 w will fit most sunglasses or reading glasses and the micro-fiber cloth to keep the screen clean,5
3071,i had one of these for the house,5
3072,these aren't huge issues for me but i can see that making your screen wet from steam,5
3073,i was going to use this case use a normal screen protector but i actually like that,5
3074,it's a great battery and that's what i got a little protection,5
3075,this waterproof phone bag looks more like dry sacks that i've used on many projects so it's not a problem,5
3076,it has two layers front inner hard case with built-in spare battery and a powered external speaker,5
3077,it is pretty glossy so if you don't like them you can just take them off,5
3078,the older but still fast 4 g hspa network is really good considering the price,5
3079,so far i'm pretty happy with the way it looks,5
3080,good quality one of the best case for the s4,5
3081,the plastic is nice and satiny soft it feels good in your hand and will provide some friction on the surface,5
3082,my only criticism of this set is that it is packaged in a slim elegant case with good versatility,5
3083,this device is great if you have a lot of devices like cell phone chargers sit there drawing electricity all day long,5
3084,it was easy to hold because of the grips on the side are effective at holding my galaxy note 3,5
3085,the battery has a capacity of 9300 mah that is a lot of room to play with when you're using your phone while walking,5
3086,the unit came in came order and right out of the box was a breeze to set-up use,5
3087,it is just the right length to reach my phone on the dash or to the windshield if that is more convenient,5
3088,i also like that it folds flat and that it has a higher edge to protect my phone if i drop it,5
3089,protects the phone is rubberized has a good grip for my husband while working,5
3090,i was unsure it was going to be one of them,5
3091,it is not very loud but she doesn't use it that much yet but it looks like its going to last along time,5
3092,i was excited to get the new trent ultra-thin iphone 5 5s casei just got my new iphone 5s,5
3093,i needed these and they work great with my iphone 4,5
3094,this case fits the phone perfectlyit does an excellent job of protecting my phone so i will always have my dual car charger with me,5
3095,the retractable tip is a nice way to protect the iphone glass yet low enough to not be intrusive to the user,5
3096,and the other reason was that i wanted to make and receive calls and listen to music over bluetooth all at the same time,5
3097,feels just tough enough to protect the screen if it falls straight down,5
3098,it is worth the peace of mind that your device is going to run out of power,5
3099,you can take it to heart that this case is just as protective as a hard shell,5
3100,item was as described and works great and easy to use,5
3101,so far i'd definitely recommend this to all at t s4 users,5
3102,and the case hasn't lost any grip on the phone so it wont fall off,5
3103,it did add a little bit of bulk but it's definitely noticeable,5
3104,i was very surprised with the quality of the product the price and the speed of the charging,5
3105,i had a similar product that i was very happy with the prompt shipment and receiving of it,5
3106,if your looking for a bargain stylus that gets the job done with computer screens and similar larger screens,5
3107,i have had this case for about a week and it seems to be more durable than the cord that comes with it,5
3108,can't say enough just love this case for color uniqueness and build quality,5
3109,if you get this battery get the one with the clip where they can clip it to the side of my waist,5
3110,what i found was that it's kind of difficult to find the exact right p,5
3111,this proved to be a problem because it fits very snugly and i am very pleased with the purchase,5
3112,05 but you'll need to use the one that came with my phone and these did the job very well,5
3113,and the skeptic in me was glad there is built-in protection against over heating over charging and over-current,5
3114,they said and i quote you are in a car in a store in starbucks etc,5
3115,i turn it back on and it didn't feel uncomfortable or distracting,5
3116,usabilityit is true that when you press the button to indicate how much power is left in the powerbank,5
3117,i also bought a case for my phone that would offer a fair amount of protection without adding allot of bulk,5
3118,this headset will come with a wall charger and does a great job of protecting it,5
3119,if you use this with a case designed just to protect the back of my phone and does not leave any fingerprints behind,5
3120,second 12000 mah means you can charge an iphone 5 up to 100 % iphone 4 120%samsung galaxy s4 60 %,5
3121,fits my iphone 5c perfectly i like how the clear back showing the nice leather-like cover of the s5,5
3122,now some reviewers were critical of access to the volume and power button and bottom for charger and headphones are open,5
3123,i have tried 4 different chargers and this one is definitely a keeper and i highly recommend it,5
3124,it is difficult to remember to keep an eye on my phone while it is charging,5
3125,1a which is enough to charge most mobile phones at least 5 times on one charge all in a fairly small package,5
3126,i have been with this razr for a few days but so far it is great,5
3127,this screen protector is very useful and it seems to hold the massive batter very well in place,5
3128,i plug it into one place and charge them both at the same time with no issues at all,5
3129,repeat otterbox customer and will continue to purchase cables from belkin to replace the cables that came with their devices,5
3130,it has 2 outputs to charge two devices at the same time such as a cell phone,5
3131,the motorola h300 is the ultimate handsfree headset for those that want a sharp looking docking station to add to your desk,5
3132,the oem wireless charging back is just slightly thicker than a otterbox case,5
3133,they are not permanently attached so you can also use the stylus to write on your tablet,5
3134,this is the third one that i have bought for my dna,5
3135,additionally the fact that this phone can do so much with this phone and i'm still using the case and it still works well,5
3136,i just use it to hold my glasses in my car and it retracts without any problem,5
3137,in my opinion this product would have to be purposeful for it to come off when you are driving,5
3138,i have a black case for my iphone 5 and absolutely love the case,5
3139,i was able to pair my phone right away and the connection is excellent,5
3140,being the power user i am i was excited to see five for 2 and i wasn't disappointed,5
3141,now i wish i had bought this case instead of the others that i wasted money on,5
3142,the reason that the phone never broke is the gorilla glass is very scratch resistant although not perfectly so,5
3143,i've tried much more expensive cases for the note but this one has a rubber insert where the spring loaded clasp contacts the phone,5
3144,i have a bose wireless and i'm always concerned when buying any item that mounts to the windshield,5
3145,i haven't dropped the phone since i got it almost 2 years ago,5
3146,overall a well made product and easy to install on my wife's new iphone,5
3147,note that the jambox is nearly identical to the 700 with one added improvement,5
3148,to sum it up the xperia zl is a very nice phone case for my htc one m8 and nexus 7,5
3149,both of the colors are exactly the same as the one on this headset in a few months,5
3150,it works with usb cord charger that comes with your smartphone then when you need to charge something,5
3151,overall the oxa ultra capacity high quality portable charger is the all-in-one battery pack this will do the trick just nicely,5
3152,the battery has openings for headphones and i was able to remove it with no pull and tug,5
3153,the case itself was fully charged in less than an hour and my screen looks as good as new and functions flawlessly,5
3154,it is very versatile as it can house a wide range of phones is great it even holds my note 2 with or without case,5
3155,it does exactly what i needed it to do and was well worth the price and i loved using it on my samasung galaxay,5
3156,it would be great for long airline flights where there is no outlet and the cord goes behind the desk for power,5
3157,you also have the ability to charge my phone and kindle more than twice,5
3158,i was able to charge my phone in my car,5
3159,you could have 15 % battery life on stock the phone can make it awkward to hold in some situations,5
3160,i have not purchased a microsd card as i do not have the screen protector that came with it,5
3161,the oleo phobic coating is by far the best and one of the easiest to use cell phone contraption i used,5
3162,love that i can be in the bathroom with the shower on full hot,5
3163,flip cover the phone does not come with a charging adapter,5
3164,i'm not an engineer builder or mathematician but i would say it is worth every single penny,5
3165,the itorch by new trent new trent itorch imp52d 5200mah external battery charger that i use with my nexus 7,5
3166,great prices an plenty of choices to choose from i was very pleased with the fit,5
3167,my first try was connecting both my galaxy note 3 phone but three times the capacity of an iphone,5
3168,it has a nice matte finish and feels nice on the phone without adding bulk and make the buttons much easier to push,5
3169,i had looked at the other ones that are on the headset and they stay in nicely,5
3170,well i struggled to put it on as it was my first time trying this type of cover and i am really enjoying it,5
3171,i 8217 m rockin 8217 this screen protector with a mirror screen protector that i have used with the iphone for a while now,5
3172,you can still get 4 g lte if you really want to save money in today's economy then shop amazon,5
3173,i like this cute cover the cut outs for the speaker camera and flash are perfect,5
3174,it was good to be able to have something that does the job in a pinch,5
3175,the included screen protector is crystal clear and easy to read,5
3176,i have dropped my phone twice since having this case and it has replaced my previous elago case,5
3177,you can't beat the fit of this case around the phone is fantastic,5
3178,it doesn't have to be removed in order to charge your devices,5
3179,this power bank can also add hours of life to your devices important when getting to an outlet is just not workable,5
3180,oh yeah and the price for such a great item i was able to place it on a place which makes the phone very thick,5
3181,in addition to working as a tripod for my flip mono hd pocket camcorder,5
3182,right now i have this on my phone and love that case was super easy to put on,5
3183,the sound quality is very good even when used in a car with decent cabin noise,5
3184,you really have to feel for the buttons to make sure you press all around the phone or it wont be closed,5
3185,no other stylus seems to work as well as looking up instructions online,5
3186,it is also possible to carry this in the same pocket with your phone it has a great clear backing with great heavy duty protection,5
3187,oem micro usb power adapter fits perfectly for charging but if you are using apple earbuds you don't need this,5
3188,takes 14 1 2 hours to fully charge my phone and tablet at the same time,5
3189,i ordered this case for my husband and he loves it because it is a conversation starter,5
3190,it protects fine adding just a tiny bit of flex so you can get the jabra sound app on your phone,5
3191,the retractable point on the trent stylus allows me to keep it in the car or in my purse for a month between uses,5
3192,bad news is that i haven't used it yet but seems well made and worth the asking price for sure,5
3193,if you need a backup phone this is the perfect phone holder for my note 3 which i am waiting to test out,5
3194,it hooked up like a dream and i now have a screen protector on the phone it will look very good,5
3195,u can put your i d and debit cards and phone and not have to get into the closet and fiddle with the receiver,5
3196,99 total if you have prime account like i do at a reasonable price and this fit the bill,5
3197,it holds my cell phone well and does the job when you are on the road,5
3198,buttons line up and has enough resistance to avoid accidental presses but not so much as to cause undue issues,5
3199,i think a standard gps unit might be too thick to be held in place securely by the hooks on the clamps,5
3200,i do too if i need to i will buy from this seller again and will always get tech armor products,5
3201,i got this case and put it on and see how it goes,5
3202,the case is light and doesn't bulk up the camera too much and it feels great in my hand but not too bulky,5
3203,so i was greatly relievied that i did not have to make any cuts also i have no bubbles after installing,5
3204,it has been in my phone for a week and have yet to need to recharge thepowerpack,5
3205,that's a feature of your phone and the case and i have dropped the phone,5
3206,maybe you can do the same things with the case off as the rubberized covering give you better feel,5
3207,i use it everyday and charges my nexus 5 and my nexus 10,5
3208,it's easy to use and i love how it works and looks on the phone,5
3209,only drawback is the charger is a little larger than your standard external battery but it is probably done to save battery,5
3210,i loved my bluetooth but lost it and had to buy another one when a friend found this one,5
3211,this item is just lovely as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it,5
3212,the plantronics voyager legend comes with a usb charging cable it won't run to date,5
3213,it gets a 5 out of 5 rating as it does the job and i can take it out with ease,5
3214,the directions were simple and everything you need to apply them with no bubbles left,5
3215,works as advertised only used it once to charge my phone,5
3216,to bad i went on a trip this past weekend and it is so easy to install and use,5
3217,i find that this anti-glare finish seems to be better than that of the otterbox univerisal for iphone,5
3218,easy to take on off and seems to protect phone from drops and mishandling,5
3219,i love the otter box series and i was in desperate need of a case so they could protect the phone,5
3220,unit does what i need but i don't like taking calls on a run anyway,5
3221,it might fit in some large pockets but i'd say that elago nailed it with this product,5
3222,but having a mounting mean for the phone so that it will not move and it does not even hurt the phone,5
3223,installation was super easy just like all the other ones i've seen have all been functional,5
3224,the only bad thing is the top and bottom are nice as is the lock for the swivel,5
3225,i also have the songza app on my iphone and now i dont have to remember that cable too,5
3226,all the benefits of an otter box but i wanted some,5
3227,fits well slips in and out of the gps unit so that it doesn't leave any messy residue,5
3228,streaming capabilities particularly surprised me in terms of sound and size,5
3229,s beam allows two samsung phones to be placed back-to-back using it's built-in magnets,5
3230,other then those two facts it doesn't take away from the fact that these are my favorite colors,5
3231,the sound quality is outstanding i feel like i am being much more productive,5
3232,another which allows access to your headphone port so that you can charge all your devices at once and at full speed,5
3233,so i am thrilled that i have a very nice glowing night light in the bathroom,5
3234,i purchased these for my father who is ready to get rid of his phone bill,5
3235,now i put it on the charger before going to bed and it is ready in the morning for another day,5
3236,my daughter just got a new phone and then bought a different phone,5
3237,i prefer this product as it is easy to align the phone on the charger and when i returned my phone was on my chair,5
3238,i dropped my phone once and really broke it and i liked it so much i purchased more for all my friends and family,5
3239,i don't seem to require a lot of force to get the phone to do everything the iphone4 can do is not bad,5
3240,i could purchase 3 back up batteries for the price i would say that it is a winner,5
3241,the camera flash lines up just a little bit off but it doesn't affect the use of the phone,5
3242,the screen cover does not inhibit the responsiveness of the phone the processor is very fast and the call quality is remarkable,5
3243,if your looking for a case to carry your phone drivers license debit card and some cash and i'm ready to power up,5
3244,anyway the charger seems well-built and has a nice finished and solid feel,5
3245,there are 4 blue led lights to indicate the charge levels and it is so convenient to have around,5
3246,other cases i've seen are bulky and would make it difficult to use the touch-screen,5
3247,this is a great soft case for the nokia lumia 521 considerably durable comes with screen protector and has nice feel in my hands,5
3248,this is the second hk case i've bought and i'm soooo glad i bit the bullet,5
3249,these screen protectors are th best i've ever put on one of these without having a meltdown,5
3250,stretch the silicone over the assembly gently so it does not come off at all over rough bumps or uneven pavement,5
3251,the size seemed a little big for the first few hours and below 50 % takes more time to be consumed,5
3252,i liked this case so much i ordered a spare,5
3253,i haven't used the usb plug in it just because i haven't had a chance to put the battery pack into,5
3254,used a few times now and the case has held up and how well it has charged,5
3255,it fits perfectly on my phone and it is not even drained,5
3256,but checked on the internet and found a posting on how to get the job done an optional free screen protector is a big plus,5
3257,i use these for my galaxy s4 and my kindle hdx 8,5
3258,the volume controls are placed on the outside of the case to easily slip in and out of a pocket but not this one,5
3259,the only very minor con so far is that there are no bubbles after installation,5
3260,great gift to my wife she was very pleased with uniqueness of the item she received,5
3261,bought this for my boyfriend who is a truck driver and still this phone case just keeps protecting his phone,5
3262,this phone is a year old and it worked just fine,5
3263,the price point is high but if you're on an international flight and want to make sure it's 100 % clean,5
3264,i have seen reviews complaining that this unit does not come with a screen protector which goes on easily,5
3265,it's a wonderful product i'd recommend for a simple thin but protective case,5
3266,the transparent backside is certainly a huge plus for people like me that might forget that the ports are different,5
3267,there is a stretchable material on the sides to give it a little something extra almost like a swarovski crystal finish,5
3268,i keep it in my backpack and i let it charge,5
3269,the cutouts are in the right place and i like that the color is close to the color of a tablet case i brought her,5
3270,got a case that has a cover for the headphones and charger,5
3271,battery packs are hard to differentiate but i can tell you the bb headset isn't bad,5
3272,i'm glad to spend a couple extra bucks for the quality of this item is a converter and does the trick,5
3273,even with a raised bezel around the screen so that i don't run out of juice any time soon,5
3274,the battery charger does take longer to charge the battery but it's not that bad,5
3275,perfect and at a great price i'd highly recommend acase,5
3276,best deal i could find with a little bit of data to spare at the end of the day,5
3277,the amazon speaker is probably one of the best purchases here on amazon,5
3278,you can't even tell there is a screen protector others find it a nuisance,5
3279,i have had this for about a month now and i'm very happy with mine,5
3280,i have been using this for months now and it is reliable and consistent gives me a little more play,5
3281,the protective film is very easy to apply the quality of the screen protector but the the phone wasn't damaged at all,5
3282,this case is exactly like the picture and it feels awesome,5
3283,i have really liked the trident case very well for the short time i used it which was downright rediculous,5
3284,i bought this headset because i didn't want to drop it but most of these things are,5
3285,cable does exactly what it is intended to do keep all of my devices charged up when on the go,5
3286,they are exactly as described and have a great texture even if a little slippery,5
3287,it works well as long as i remember to put my phone in the center,5
3288,the grey one was so slick i had a hard time finding a case that wasn't too bulky like a otterbox or lifeproof,5
3289,my galaxy notell is huge with this case it looks beautiful i have received many compliments on it,5
3290,next there's a soft interchangeable outer gel skin layer that makes it easy to unplug from the car's outlet,5
3291,this is a set of bluetooth earbuds that pair with your phone and you can adjust the angle of the stand which is extremely handy,5
3292,i absolutly love the sound quality and the other party can hear me very well just like i speak without the headset,5
3293,went to this cable and works well and don't have to hurt my eyes to see what's on my screen,5
3294,i have this unit connect to my samsung galaxy siii with the battery backup case on the phone,5
3295,it was shipped fast and came as described with no problems delivered at a fair price,5
3296,i'm happy with this item and have had no problems with the items,5
3297,i charge them in a few hours and it works great,5
3298,the ismooth 7 ft micro usb cable is a very high quality sync charging cable for older ios devices,5
3299,its a 100 phone you get what you pay for and i didn't have to push anything to turn it on wake it up,5
3300,my ravpower dual usb charger died recently so i decided to get the same case for this phone,5
3301,really attractive cell phone case made of thick rubber so it will protect your phone from drops the apple bumper may be a better choice,5
3302,according to the specs the resolution may not be the same as being in a theater but the sound nearly is,5
3303,or do you want something that will protect your screen but don't want to spend a whole lot on car chargers for their devices,5
3304,like all slim cases the protection is always going to be the one you have with you,5
3305,i have been using it anywhere i want to listen to my music or talk on the phone,5
3306,love that battery charger charges very fast and i don't have to open my ipad to change the music especially in flights,5
3307,this one is more comfortable and has lasted longer than any other case i've had,5
3308,does everything i need and i don't have to carry a purse i have everything i need compact and in one place,5
3309,it's serviceable and adds a function that is nice to have but it seems a teeny tine bit flimsy,5
3310,these behave just like the four buttons on the bottom of the phone,5
3311,the bad thing is that depending on the type of phone you have it's a clip so it works on all phones,5
3312,it's roughly the size of a small external usb 3,5
3313,and i can put my credit card and i d this is extremely nice,5
3314,this one is holding up great and it's the best thing i ever bought,5
3315,i've been thru three different screen protectors for my iphone these did a great job,5
3316,the last thing i really wanted to do was to buy a case that would take away from the curvy beauty of the galaxy,5
3317,i have a 4 year old and a few of my power switch modules,5
3318,take it with me to the gym to listen to my music through my bluetooth makes it worth every penny,5
3319,it covers the phone exactly the same on the back and the fit is perfect,5
3320,lastly i love that you can keep a few credit cards or your i d as well love the color,5
3321,i used a method where i pulled the plastic off as i laid it down and pulled it up several times,5
3322,i have only used it maybe 5 times so i can not comment on it i only use the batteries,5
3323,in just a week it's very nice and fits like a glove,5
3324,i got this because i didn't want the holster when i ordered this,5
3325,well worth the wait to get it for a fraction of the verizon phone store price,5
3326,i am suspecting that asus has used a non-standard usb cable your sony camera e,5
3327,that doesn't mean the moto g camera is not good if i had long drives or would really need my phone later,5
3328,this is a good case for your iphone this is the case for you,5
3329,i've dropped my phone that seems to be the only case that works with the hyperion extended battery case,5
3330,first thing i noticed was the covers over the buttons on the phone are completely covered yet still very accessible,5
3331,galaxy's are made to take a drop so we don't have to keep it in my back pocket,5
3332,there is a cut out for the magnetic dock which i haven't been able to expose it to bright direct sunlight,5
3333,it even has a light on the side that can be used to charge a usb device or to charge the battery itself,5
3334,a blue light lets you know it is being charged,5
3335,it is made well and has a ball point pen which is very handy,5
3336,it also is easier to hold on to than without a case but its nothing to complain about,5
3337,this is a very nice little charger that works as advertised and can significantly extend the use time of your device samsung tab 3 10,5
3338,since i have bluetooth hands free control this is perfect for my son who is accident prone,5
3339,you see the back of the phone makes it easier to grip when texting,5
3340,as a guy i have a hard time finding some of them,5
3341,great product with awesome sound not to mention they are cute as a button,5
3342,it is great on the phone and it's not so thin that i still feel nervous about carrying my phone,5
3343,it is designed to connect to most bluetooth enabled devices and when paired with a zagg shield and it will not be my last,5
3344,i got it right on both mine and my wife batteries and still have a little bit of charge left over,5
3345,i might buy another one so i don't have to carry a purse to for a quick errand,5
3346,one of the best things i have ever seen in terms of support for the phone,5
3347,very good protection fits tightly on the phone so it is always handy when needed,5
3348,i have the galaxy note 2 and it works perfectly,5
3349,you can use it too on your phone to talk to you and tell you the stage it is at e,5
3350,i loved this case online and when i put it on the car charger to-and-from work,5
3351,you also have the benefit of retracting the tip so you can carry it in your pocket which i don't do,5
3352,the one thing odd about it is that the cord is about six to eight inches too short,5
3353,gone are the days when i had to recharge mid afternoon,5
3354,i would of like to get some for the back of my phone that i have e er had,5
3355,great charger and works great in my car works great with my iphone 4s,5
3356,the stand is bang in the center of the back of the phone is glass so it sticks slightly,5
3357,i have come to hate bubbles and thought i would have to put it on my ipad,5
3358,very happy with this screen protector went on easily and aligned perfectly,5
3359,at 3000 mah it is capable of giving my iphone 4s one full charge and then another partial charge for an iphone or kindle paperwhite,5
3360,aesthetics are important to me and the call quality is remarkable,5
3361,the textured grips on the sides insures the phone won't be dented or scratched if dropped,5
3362,21 removes all bloatware and now they make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger,5
3363,it really felt like it gave my phone good protection and is not too bulky to keep you from accessing the sides of the screen,5
3364,fit as good as factory at a fraction of the cost of an otter box,5
3365,connected to my computer via usb micro cable it was instantly recognized and my homescreen appeared in portrait mode,5
3366,it takes a little effort to get the phone into the holster top first,5
3367,the life proof has a strange bump on the camera ear piece area of the bottom end and soak it up with a paper towel,5
3368,not that it really means something but it's enough to turn on the flashlight is a little too easy to press for some,5
3369,i bought the item to give it as a gift for my daughter who works from home part of the time,5
3370,the product is great charges at the same time very helpful when two people are in the car,5
3371,this is another successfulproduct of the new trent power pack model imp500 but believe you can never have too many batter cables and chargers,5
3372,if it can be charged via an ac adapter or the usb charger,5
3373,did exactly what it said it was going to be heavy but it really isn't,5
3374,other than that it certainly cuts down on the number of cables i need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously,5
3375,the light on the charger is nice to have in your car for your iphone,5
3376,of course you can charge two devices at once though to do so you'll need to use your own apple cords,5
3377,i wish that there was a way to turn that off,5
3378,my grandchildren wanted a longer cord my favorite had what i needed and i am very satisfied with his case,5
3379,all-in-all i'm quite happy with the unit,5
3380,i contacted new trent's support and they mailed me a new set even before receiving my return,5
3381,i use it to take my iphone from an almost dead battery and the backup pack is still reporting a full charge,5
3382,such as when i go take my dog for a walk or i should say she took me for a walk,5
3383,this will work to protect my phone and this makes it well protected,5
3384,read the reviews mine came just fine fit the phone and didn't even leave a mark from an accidental poke from her nails,5
3385,i ordered this case for my girlfriend and she really loves it,5
3386,fits my iphone 5 good but now i have a replacement for when it inevitably fails,5
3387,i like the price and it helps to keep the phone from falling down from the kickstand from failing,5
3388,using the power griddle itself it took about 1 hour for me to charge up my phone after watching a movie,5
3389,then i got a really good set of headphones to listen to music and forget about my outdated speakers,5
3390,one thing i like about this is that there is nothing that can come apart no silicone covers or such,5
3391,the quality of the film is on par with its rivals including the maximum connectivity lte and nfc,5
3392,i would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap reliable charger that don't cost so much get this one cause it works great,5
3393,ive already dropped my phone on concrete and asphault i'm a klutz,5
3394,she has had it for a while and it works great,5
3395,got it for my daughter she absolutely loved it and so did i so i bought two more for friends who wanted it as well,5
3396,it's comfortable it works well and it is not hard to pull on and off when needed,5
3397,went on easy and i have only had to use one so far bc they stick so well,5
3398,this comes with two switchable cover plates for the back of the phone case to keep the color from getting scratched up,5
3399,neat design that reduces the number of cables i need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously,5
3400,match your case by model number not name and you will get the kind of pictures that you wish,5
3401,i've had other cimo cases for other phones and they've been amazing,5
3402,the unit comes with two usb ports so you can see the screen,5
3403,had this case for 2 months solid on my phone and it looks really nice on my note 2,5
3404,i purposely purchased the jabra cruiser2 similarly priced to this for my wife so she can still have her otterbox on her phone,5
3405,all buttons and openings are accessible using this case with the straightalk galaxy sii sgh-s959 g version cell phone,5
3406,she likes the fact that she don't have to put down the stylus and hunt around for a pen,5
3407,delivery timethe product arrived at my door within a few days,5
3408,this case doesn't compromise the thin design of the case is rather unique,5
3409,there are things that need to be met in order for me to leave my honest feedback,5
3410,3 % efficiency and it means that you can charge two devices at once,5
3411,but from whatever searches i did for fun it seems to be very stable no lock-ups app crashes or anything,5
3412,i especially like the fact that i no longer have to worry about not being ableto finish our music practices within the day,5
3413,the droid will play them no problem as long as you have your keys and usb capable charger handy,5
3414,just order it and you be just as thrilled with it as i am with the phones well actually that isn't true,5
3415,my only advice is to be certain you are not buying a otter box case,5
3416,i always loose mines so you might want to buy something with a bit more color,5
3417,the color is similar to the photo is easy to place on the phones home button i loved it very cute,5
3418,the case fits the phone snugly and the grooves on the sides for holding your phone securely in your hand,5
3419,the biggest plus for me is that it is on heavy bulky side but that's what makes the phone lightweight and sleek,5
3420,5 mm ultra thin slim-fit case for htc one as i wasn't sure which i would prefer,5
3421,its not as big but works great and has a good wire length for smart phone uses,5
3422,you also get a microfiber cloth and a squeegee although i would have liked it more if there was an option for a 4,5
3423,it is easy to get it out and put it inside of the back plate,5
3424,will buy again and the colors are vibrant and just as the picture shows,5
3425,i found in another review here that you have to click the button to start charging a device,5
3426,this does seem rather slow by today's standards but they aren't uncomfortable,5
3427,0 high-speed cables for our android phones and my daughter uses it for her iphone and my eyes were opened,5
3428,i bought this a while ago and i used them immediately,5
3429,you won 8217 t ever know the charge of the battery based on four blue leds on the side,5
3430,first off i'm not a fan of the glossy top,5
3431,things i love anti-glare my phone is much easier to hold than those skinny pens inside the samsung note series,5
3432,there's not much more to say other than it's all your thunderbolt needs if you have the extended battery,5
3433,this cable has a standard usb-a port which when the cable is plugged in and ready to go,5
3434,there is a hair's breadth of room in the depth of the case but this one is still bright and clean,5
3435,my brother has dropped his phone several times and so far no complaints,5
3436,it isn't very sturdy but it is indeed beautiful and if you don't like them you can just take them off,5
3437,bought it as a gift and the person on the other end never complained of noise or echo or anything,5
3438,i watched the little tutorial and was a little intimidated didn't think i would ever go back to a 2 year contract,5
3439,i got this for my cousin and she was very pleased with this item would buy again from this seller,5
3440,the ports are all clearly labeled but it does not light up until it is plugged into the charger,5
3441,the keyboard is much much better than my s3 and it looks like it's made to last,5
3442,liked it super cute just don't like that it doesn't stick out far which i was worried about,5
3443,i just got a new iphone and want to protect it then feel free to buy this case it works,5
3444,9 from 10 % to 90 % in ten minutes,5
3445,however i have been using this headset for several days now but so far i am loving these headphones,5
3446,yes it fits properly on my nexus 5 and my nexus 7 simultaneously,5
3447,in this particular usage scenario i used the battery to be sure i'd get a full day and then some extra,5
3448,what is relevant is the fact that this will fully charge five devices at once need i say more,5
3449,but for this price i don't mind buying another 1,5
3450,on the wristband is the camera and the speaker on the phone and looks oem,5
3451,these also let you know how much power you have left on the headset before needing to recharge the imp52d,5
3452,and would tell others to buy this product from this vendor together with their qi receivers,5
3453,i like how i can use the same unit to charge both my iphone and ipad and keep them both powered up,5
3454,the colors are great and my phone doesn't feel bulky in my hand and still fits easily into my jean's pockets,5
3455,this is wrap around and the matte rubbery feel makes it easy to browse through pages or use one hand swype texting,5
3456,i use it in my bed room it's perfect for when you want to go 34 bumperless 34,5
3457,pros perfect fit no gaps easy to install and to get the air bubbles out but not impossible,5
3458,i thought it would be a two-piece case for my iphone as i use it as my main charger,5
3459,i purchased this along withqmadix gel for motorola mb810 droid x flex black it still fits just fine,5
3460,only took me three 3 minuets to put on the phone and is thicker than the others,5
3461,the only complaint i have has nothing to do with the quality or functionality of this unit,5
3462,it's better to watch a movie on your ipad and run out of power,5
3463,at first i was concerned that the screen was smaller that my gs4 and htc one,5
3464,too bad i dropped my phone and it's the best,5
3465,you can spend more but i don't think it has an auto off feature,5
3466,it covers then phone nicely and doesn't add a lot to the weight of the phone,5
3467,love the white color b c it's the same color i expected it to be,5
3468,initially i was happy as it was less slippery and had a better grip-like surface,5
3469,other than the multifunction button i don't have any downsides at all to my choice,5
3470,android os is good but not as good as some of my higher end shures,5
3471,i had the same style charger from griffin for my previous iphone and was looking for something comparable for my iphone 5,5
3472,products used in testing iphone 5s ipad minithis product was very easy to install this on my iphone5,5
3473,also love that you can see the back of my phone and almost looks like it isn't even there,5
3474,mine probably get slid out of it's case or it won't fit in the slot for the dock,5
3475,this beast got me through about 10 hours before i had to go to verizon with the phone imei to get one,5
3476,highly recommended by both grandma and her son-in-law however i have not used mine or shared with them,5
3477,i got actually 2 of these and they work very well,5
3478,screws flash photography but i don't use vibrate at all so it's not an issue carrying it around,5
3479,this one has the rubber soft tip which i like better than the android or ios camera apps,5
3480,the iphone 5 is not better than the 2010 version of the same phone for that,5
3481,i purchased this as a gift for my niece as a stocking stuffer,5
3482,a simple inexpensive way to get rid of all the bubbles,5
3483,for the money you won't get a lot of drop protection but you need to prioritize,5
3484,the case fits very well with the phone and i am glad i did,5
3485,i purchased this not only to save a few bucks on a phone holder for my care,5
3486,this charger is perfect for when you want to go light,5
3487,it's smaller than you'd think so it is easy to overlook the tiny switch on the side of the nightstand,5
3488,battery life this phone has given me the one of the best case i have owned by far,5
3489,it's also nice to know that the phone isn't going crazy trying to figure out whether it has power,5
3490,i am shocked at the feel of the case is very similar to the armorsuit product,5
3491,with this product you can be sure that it won't scratch your phone,5
3492,i wish they had more colors because i would've bought them both for this price because it's fantastic price,5
3493,i was able to successfully charge my phone without any issues and it looks great,5
3494,little to no bubbles once it was applied and it doesn't interfere with the function of the nfc and the camera,5
3495,i bought this for a friend and she loved it i bought one for my wife's phone,5
3496,the opposite side of the interior of the case has a nice clean professional look,5
3497,data access is just as fast as using a wall charger,5
3498,skinomi in my opinion is the built in screen protector feels smooth sturdy and has given me no problems,5
3499,this is the cable to buy if you don't want to spend money everytime you drop it buy this,5
3500,ive had this for a few months now and they are tough slim and nice,5
3501,batter life is well over double what the battery life of the phone but made it very bulky,5
3502,i got this car charger for my iphone went bad,5
3503,just looking at the photos does not let you know when battery is getting low you simply have to push the on off button,5
3504,i have other mhl adapters but they didn't work and were to bulky,5
3505,there were no scratches on the screen protector that is easily replaceable,5
3506,i've had my t610 for about 3 months now and i used it everyday without a hitch,5
3507,this is my second otterbox i am in a wheelchair and needed something for my car,5
3508,not all of the power banks that i have ever tested on an ipad,5
3509,worth buy and i would recommend it to anyone who would like to activate a phone,5
3510,the build quality is very good and feels as if it were meant to add luck,5
3511,i primarily bought this for my galaxy s3 and as soon as i tell them they have to share the 2,5
3512,the only thing is that it does not have threaded messaging,5
3513,very nice i was very skeptical about this product since i haven't seen this in any of the other reviews,5
3514,i loved the look the feel and the ease of use that it provides,5
3515,i have had my white iphone 4 since it came out and i also got the note 3 for 200 through amazon,5
3516,performs and works almost identically to the stock charger that came with the phone and for the level of protection and the sturdy kickstand,5
3517,my iphone contained 2 % battery life when i plugged in the micro usb cable that came with the apple device and the 2,5
3518,the energizer i had didn't cut it and i wasn't so sure this little gizmo was going to do anything,5
3519,i take no issues with the build quality it doesn't look like something to steal when my car is parked,5
3520,s3 was impossible to put a screen protector i have ever used,5
3521,it has a honeycomb design and feels better in your hand than the defender but not as bulky,5
3522,it has two charging ports one 1a and one 2a you can charge two devices at once one at 2,5
3523,i have used it to charge my gsiii and charged it from 20 % 100 % before it needed a charge itself,5
3524,it's what i saw read and i got ta say this was really impressive battery,5
3525,item came exactly as described fit perfectly on my phone it looks like a more expensive phone becouse of the case,5
3526,it fits his phone perfectly it has a nice lip to protect the screen and with the anti-glare screen protector too,5
3527,long and are very comfortable in the hand and doesn't slip or fall off easily,5
3528,i haven't experienced any problem at all getting the phone out of your pocket and doesn't attract lint,5
3529,however the only problem i have is that when the phone is facing down,5
3530,in terms of the phone itself the screen is beautiful and this device is really fast,5
3531,fast delivery good quality product feels durable and i really enjoy my music and tv in the shower good purchase,5
3532,i was looking for a new one and do not want to carry a wallett,5
3533,i was looking for a screen protector for your cell phone,5
3534,ever since i got my nexus 4 with glass on the back with a carabiner so it can be clipped to just about anything,5
3535,i am glad i will be the first to say that i am very impressed,5
3536,i recommend these if you have a need for a big phone holder,5
3537,the stand on the back is a little thicker than my previous,5
3538,i love the feel of the case is very sturdy and beautiful and was under 10,5
3539,every one of them is a perfect fit and all the buttons work flawlessly,5
3540,then every 2 to 3 days so not sure how long it took as i went to sleep,5
3541,1 amps which is a requirement for the ipad 2 and it lasted me only about 35 hrs,5
3542,of course it is also 6 34 which is going to be a long and updating review and opinion,5
3543,i ordered this for my droid x although i suspect it would work well with a small gps or similar devices too,5
3544,all parts that touch your phone are soft rubber but the back is made of a clear plastic which protects the delicate back plastic,5
3545,this xl unit is for my samsung galaxy s4 and a motorola droid razr maxx hd and a samsung galaxy s4,5
3546,we would of course make a joke out of it but it is so convenient when your out and about all day,5
3547,i was provided a sample to test and evaluate in exchange for an onest unbaised review,5
3548,but for many of us who wants to know exactly how much difference is between charges but it charges and operates well,5
3549,this is an unheralded line from otterbox and really does a great job of snuggly encasing my phone,5
3550,i have been looking for a quality desk stand for my iphone for a while and finally decided on this one,5
3551,i would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend the amount for the samsung battery,5
3552,the cord is a bit flimsy and is only 3 feet long which is perfect in my car for charging my bluetooth adapter,5
3553,the commuter series does not make your phone bulky at all,5
3554,there are many new cases out that are not as good as 100 earphones but for this price i'm happy to share,5
3555,this means that i can use my finger on the touch screen of my tablet and phone,5
3556,it's light and compact so i can just throw my phone in to start charging,5
3557,it also comes with a very well made easy to use quality unit that will serve you for quite a while,5
3558,and of course amazon has the very best price i could find that also came with a charger,5
3559,as to the size it can easily fit in my pockets i wear skinny jeans,5
3560,it doesn't have a lot of time to find the best prices on merchandise,5
3561,i have dropped the phone with this case this is the cutties case,5
3562,the added protection of the flip cover over the screen and the touch screen still works great,5
3563,the charger has two usb ports one is for 2amp tablets and the other is a 5v-2a,5
3564,there isn't a lot more to talk about with this phone size and samsung's customer service,5
3565,bought this for my dad phone and he loves the stand for watching videos on his phone,5
3566,the 3 m smart pen is one of the best i've tried have reordered a few more packs,5
3567,its adorable i just wish it wasn't so complicated to put it in and remove but i don't see that changing,5
3568,this product has allowed me to get rid of my old clock,5
3569,it is a little heavier than i would like but it is a nice quality case,5
3570,the plastic is durable and it fits my samsung galaxy siii perfectly and looks great,5
3571,also being a usb charger you don't have to sit right next to your mouth,5
3572,disclaimer i received a free review sample from the manufacturer the black model and carefully tested it,5
3573,this is a durable case that goes on easily and fits perfectly but can be removed quickly if necessary,5
3574,it's not hard to put it back in but it still doesn't come out,5
3575,i like it and it works well in the car and also connect it to my macbook,5
3576,i dropped the phone once on to concrete and the case got a little scratch but nothing big,5
3577,i have a phone case and this screen protector does its job as advertised,5
3578,i don't have a case on it but i have had no issues,5
3579,one fried has already asked my where did i get it from and i told him masione,5
3580,in 20 minutes it charged my phone from 0 to 100 % with this charger,5
3581,i like it because if fits on the charger and the lightning bolt pops up and the phone starts charging,5
3582,i've had this for a month and used it in the shower lol,5
3583,it may be bulky but you get use to it and love the extra juice it provides,5
3584,this power bank features a built in micro-usb charging cable yes no need for any proprietary adapters,5
3585,some sales staff is not aware that it is possible to get a bubble free application,5
3586,with an output of 1a charging will be a little slower than the external charger that came with my ipad,5
3587,it's just a very good case not too bulky attractive and you can hear everything very clearly,5
3588,the screen protector didn't have a cutout for the front camera and proximity sensor fit perfectly,5
3589,i love having one battery inside and one on the side for the appropriate charging cord,5
3590,it wont provide protection from scratches so make sure you get the full-on premier activation code,5
3591,it charges my blackberry torch in less than an hour it showed 4 blue lights on the well designed front plate,5
3592,i was given the opportunity to test this on my iphone in case it didn't work,5
3593,so when i saw this one and the price was right,5
3594,you have to take your belt on off to get it into the position you want carefully apply and press it down,5
3595,it's cuter than shown on the picture i was so happy when i pulled this one out of the park,5
3596,and without doubt i've never had any problems with it so far,5
3597,that being said i ordered this one and a silicone one,5
3598,the skin affords a very slight lip around the edge to keep the screen of your phone,5
3599,i love this thing so much that i don't leave the phone laying when i'm on the road and unable to charge,5
3600,i've been wanting blue tooth to hook up to my phone when i am not using it or club idwmhwianui for short,5
3601,well the screen protector is a perfect fit for my galaxy 2 tmobile t989,5
3602,this one is very smooth and i can see it will provide great protection,5
3603,i actually bought an asus transformer tf700 at the same time and that definitely helps reduce battery consumption,5
3604,jawbone 2 pros noise canceling works very well while on calls,5
3605,my favorite thing about this case has to be the best wallet flip open case,5
3606,i'm really unhappy not to be able to make it a full day,5
3607,the only thing i would have liked is it could be a little smaller it would fit in my carrying case by grantwood technology,5
3608,update march 17 2012 i figured out how to raise the volume on it,5
3609,i like the phone as it does in the shown picture and i am very pleased with the result,5
3610,i you lose them you don't feel as though it will fall out,5
3611,we have a larger one at 11 000mah and it can charge my phone at anytime and this really helps,5
3612,i've gone through at least a dozen cases before finding this one i absolutely love this case,5
3613,shrugs i recommend this case if you are looking for it comes most highly recommended,5
3614,i thought that this smooth guard was going to be the same as the s3 which i have no problems with it,5
3615,there are two speakers i'm pretty sure it could reach the back seat,5
3616,update that belt loop in the back of the phone is protected if it ever falls face down,5
3617,protects phone and you are able to still use the touch screen with the phone in there which is a plus,5
3618,i have no gripes about the quality or the durability of this device,5
3619,recharges from 20 % off a 5v 2amp port in around 5-6 hours via1a adaptor battery capacity 5200 mah dimensions 3,5
3620,there is an edge all around so as long as the phone transmitting the signal is within reach,5
3621,now i just upgraded to note 3 at t and i could not be happier with my purchase,5
3622,it even comes with a cover and a 1 year warranty all at the right price,5
3623,ringke makes great slim cases and i would highly recommend it if your battery isn't already dead,5
3624,i knew that the length would not be an issue if you bought this directly from amazon,5
3625,first at 1750 mah it's going to take twice as long to charge your ipad,5
3626,if you want a nice rugged case that is easy to grip is tough and protective and looks military and macho,5
3627,the battery pack is easy to charge and just as easy to remove,5
3628,i'm very worried and concerned i have yet to receive my button stickers i was extremely pleased with it,5
3629,my main complaint about the software is that it starts when you turn on your phone you can see every thing clear,5
3630,i powered it on as per the instructions and it gave me a lot,5
3631,very awesome case good quality n sturdy i can say so far this is my best case out of the two i bought,5
3632,included in the package is 2 chargers and 2 micro usb to usb charging cables 20 60 cm,5
3633,the holster holds the phone with friction but you can turn it off by the way but once you get used to that as well,5
3634,they are easy to apply and i can not even tell that i have a protector on which is a plus,5
3635,i'm able to bring my phone from dead to 100 % in a matter of hours even after a fifteen-hour charge,5
3636,i find it very easy to use the iphone while it's streaming music to the dock,5
3637,and my optometrist will be thrilled that i'm now using as my primary music listening ipod,5
3638,this battery was the best accessory i have ever bought for this low of a price,5
3639,murphy's law is in action here and i haven't dropped my phone thank god so i can't attest to battery life,5
3640,i enjoy changing cases and this is one of the best cases that i have ever purchased,5
3641,so i simply replaced the film with another in a matter of minutes first shot and was very pleased with the product,5
3642,the faceplate at least the one i received is the genuine article,5
3643,the plantronics voyager pro hd bluetooth headset is without a doubt the strongest case i have ever had for any phone i owned,5
3644,it hold my phone when i put it to the test,5
3645,would highly recommend if you're looking for something slim that adds a significant amount of thickness and weight to your iphone 4,5
3646,great buy and i would buy another if i change phones,5
3647,it works with android apple windows ubuntu blackberry as long as it has the charge rating you require for your device,5
3648,it looks great and the quality is good as well,5
3649,so just take care of not dropping the phone and enjoy the wonderful design of apple iphone 5,5
3650,the otterbox commuter case is probably the best one i've used and i've been impressed with how durable this battery is,5
3651,this is just great we have it in the kitchen and my wife and i have had one from the beginning,5
3652,it took me a while to get it so be patient,5
3653,aside from feeling cheap and flimsy i don't have a good grip on the phone,5
3654,it came fully charged and i haven't had any problems with it falling out of my pocket,5
3655,only thing you need to keep in mind is that it is much longer than the tired stock batteries they replaced,5
3656,the shipping was really fast and when it arrived i knew i made the right choice,5
3657,i have about three kinds of stylus and i haven't found myself browsing around at all,5
3658,there's also a usb port so you will need to buy an extra adapter to have the headset work in your ear,5
3659,however it seems like it would work well for the spring and summer time,5
3660,and worth the money they are awesome stylus and i will be buying more for my mom and ipad,5
3661,prior to getting this blackberry i had to find a good case around the 2 price,5
3662,otherwise it is awesome and the price is right which is another nice point,5
3663,this also charges at a level that allows me to charge an iphone and ipad both to 100 % just as expected,5
3664,have it in my purse the cover protects all sides of the phone and has a good length cord,5
3665,i received the itorch imp52d about a week ago and have been using it now for about 3 months and it hasn't stretched out,5
3666,bought for car charger and so far everything is working exactly like it is supposed to and seems to be very durable,5
3667,feels a little flimsy at first but once its on the phone it feels much more secure and better with this case on,5
3668,i had an old motorola razor cell phone but it would not stream netflix until almost half way home on the ride,5
3669,my phone bling and this is one of my rare ten star products,5
3670,this case is just right for note3 i am going to order another style from the same company,5
3671,i didn't feel any difference in my screen clarity and brightness when placing it right next to my laptop while i'm working,5
3672,this works well with my samsung galaxy siii and it's hard to get off the case lol,5
3673,at first pressing the power button seemed to be a bit more careful to ensure you've got a good resolution on your phone ie,5
3674,i love this product my i phone look good and it is easy to work with and did exactly what i expected it to,5
3675,the sound is good and the battery life hasn't run out yet,5
3676,when easily installed correctly these are the best bang for your buck in the current world of smart phones,5
3677,i use a hands free all the time so i have to assume it would not work well at all,5
3678,i love this cover it is so beautiful and i got sooooo many compliments on it,5
3679,many of the stock ones you get with your phone is simply too constricting,5
3680,i recommend if you get this case you will not have that problem,5
3681,very happy with it and it works and does what it was purchased for,5
3682,this headset is by far the best one i have owned i'm able to rest the phone in the car,5
3683,i've had other back up batteries but this one is by far the best extended battery specifically for your note 2,5
3684,reasonable price for a product that does exactly what it advertises and does it well,5
3685,also it is very easy to pair with any device,5
3686,i also had no problems charging two devices at once on it yet,5
3687,it is no need to spend any more money than 9,5
3688,it landed right on the corner above the camera and it is really a good set at a great price,5
3689,i have had mine for over a year and it wears well,5
3690,i replaced the original battery with this one and it works just as well or even better than my finger,5
3691,i've had this battery for over a week and it is holding up great,5
3692,i use this to plug in my htc evo 4 g on sprint for the past 18 months,5
3693,the parts are made of good quality and really does protect,5
3694,i'm already using one on my phone and it helps reduce the strain on my eyes,5
3695,in some protectors i've used in the past and the sound is as good as your headphones or ear bud speakers,5
3696,it looks good it's functional it holds up to the abuse after a couple months but i have no worries with this case,5
3697,overall i'm happy with this purchase and would happily to buy it again,5
3698,it's not quite the length of a standard pen and my wife has smaller hands and does not have any rubber,5
3699,i have not times a full charge yet but it seems to be a bit thicker than some other protectors that i have,5
3700,i've also fumbled my phone a few times and it has been a great battery for me,5
3701,if i needed a third battery i would definitely buy another if they weren't so expensive,5
3702,after breaking my s3 and getting it replaced i decided to add a screen protector especially if you put credit cards into the slots,5
3703,anyhow look up videos on youtube the entire process took me less than an hour to remove and replace the glass,5
3704,it can also use this technology to wake you in the night or keep you from falling asleep,5
3705,the texture and optical quality of these screen protectors is identical the ones that come with the phone,5
3706,not too bulky but still protected my phone and i dropped it once and it and my phone connected quickly,5
3707,call quality in my opinion is even better when i use this headset in my wifi and bluetooth networks at home,5
3708,i chose red because it looks great on my phone will be back for more,5
3709,since these don't stick out in the back like some other case makers tend to do,5
3710,i like that they don 8217 t get lost and they are easy to setup with the iphone app,5
3711,this phone is the sleekest and one of the best out there if tpu is your favorite not bulky,5
3712,the stones have not come out and i love that it's flexible but not super soft and squishy,5
3713,now i just hope they come out with some other colors,5
3714,give it a try at the price even if you don't really know what else to say best it,5
3715,i believe that htc has found the sweet spot with the samsung galaxy victory 4 g lte,5
3716,i love being able to leave my phone charging and still be able to see it,5
3717,there are no scratches on my screen and this was a good solution for that problem,5
3718,i wasn't sure when i got this that i would use it and write a review was stated,5
3719,the batteries are equal or a bit better than the 2 g version i had,5
3720,i was also able to charge my ipad my wife's phone or via usb to my macbook pro,5
3721,on the side that sticks to the phone i would even go to say that this is the best charger i have owned,5
3722,althought it does get dirty easily and it's very hard to get these batteries out of their very tight packaging,5
3723,i will say this is one of the best bluetooth headset for audio quality on both ends,5
3724,the price was fair and it shipped on time i would certainly buy this product if needed it's just that good,5
3725,this is a very well designed and thought out little product,5
3726,i own two of these cases one for me and one for my husband,5
3727,i wish i had one of these on their phone,5
3728,this item arrived on time and as described,5
3729,update new photos at amazon now you can see that this phone is built to last,5
3730,i am always watching videos and listening to music it seems like the 240's have trouble connecting,5
3731,i am a jawbone icon owner and i can say this is the best money i have spent on my phone,5
3732,i think this product is a great alternative for the phone,5
3733,i love this battery and recomend it for anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive case it's a win all around,5
3734,the case is made out of it's a little hard to reach in there but not too bad,5
3735,it fits almost flush into the lighter port and allow the lid to close,5
3736,it's lightweight and extremely comfortable probably at the top of the portable battery charger game right now,5
3737,you only expose this and the phone is much more affordable than the mall,5
3738,it plays in mono so i can still get the full visual effect from your phone's screen,5
3739,this is a quality holster that is large enough to hold my otter box commuter case,5
3740,it protects the phone very well also i love the feel and the card holders work perfectly,5
3741,fits like a glove i'm not sure how long it takes to charge but you have to expect that,5
3742,yeah this is a fantastic case it protects the phone without distorting the color or anything,5
3743,like the airbender case for my ipad and went ahead to buy secondary attachable panel,5
3744,i bought this for my sister and she really loved it,5
3745,wonderful product fits the phone exactly as it is suppose to and quicker then the original galaxy note,5
3746,i still give this case a 5 star rating i would buy this case again for the holster,5
3747,this case is what the description says it will work with the wireless charging orb,5
3748,got the xlink which is way smaller than i thought it would be a two-piece case but it was only one,5
3749,the beep is a nice touch it's just the right color so that i can see it and use it,5
3750,the cord is once and long compared to the one that comes with the phone snaps on nice n tight looks clean,5
3751,the device itself seems very well made and i love the way the case improves your grip on the phone while still offering protecting,5
3752,the case is very easy to take on and off with previous phones,5
3753,however i think it is too grippy to put in a pocket glove box drawer backpack or purse,5
3754,energizer universal multi-port smartphone rechargeable charger is a perfect solution for my living room that doesn't need the latest and greatest,5
3755,lookout and mobile security do a fine job of charging my tablet and my usb diabetic blood meter,5
3756,i found this combo very useful in day to day usage maybe only when downloading movies and other large files,5
3757,i rate this item a 5 because it is exactly what was delivered,5
3758,this charger allows me to switch cables with the wall plug so if you order this you will not be disappointed,5
3759,love that battery charger charges very fast and i don't have to,5
3760,i can just throw a dead battery on it put a fresh one in each morning when i leave and charge one,5
3761,great value price front and back screen protectors you're golden,5
3762,i received the sim card on time and it was easy to apply with no bubbles but all screen protectors are like that,5
3763,it looks like it will protect the phone in case of an impact,5
3764,otherwise i love it and get compliments on it all the time,5
3765,the charging is done via the micro usb cable charges the case not the phone this time,5
3766,i love this case shows off my pink iphone and i've had no problems and it does the job,5
3767,i dropped my phone a couple times with this case on and it's steady regardless of the road service,5
3768,you really can't get lost when it comes to the actual phone part i have absolutely no complaints,5
3769,put the protector on from one side to another and it worked perfectly,5
3770,i purchased this car charger for my iphone 4 so these are great for me,5
3771,here's my original review of the fitbit one you can see it here amazon review r1cvxeeyiair0w ref cm cr rdp perm,5
3772,it first notified me that a call was coming in on my note 2,5
3773,so my present evaluation is that this case is ingenuously designed and might eliminate the need to carry a cord around just for charging,5
3774,mic charger headphone jack camera flash and speaker are perfectly aligned and provide easy access,5
3775,go for this one there is no going back for him,5
3776,i type with my thumbs to the side and i use this adhesive for all of my repairs,5
3777,i use this for my ipod and i can not attest to that,5
3778,that was the year i scratched my first screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen impressive,5
3779,it is worth every penny i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish case,5
3780,i have the gsm version of the nexus to use on t-mobile in lansing mi,5
3781,the case is easily removed for battery replacement and you don't feel like dealing with and letting it go to voice-mail,5
3782,it is almost like not having a screen protector on it,5
3783,it nice looking compact device with a wall charger and does a great job at that,5
3784,works like a charm and does what it is supposed to do and was shipped quickly,5
3785,i heard the person on the other end would not be able to call anyone because i don't have one to use them on,5
3786,these bluetooth headphones really give you the most bang for the back as far as size and power,5
3787,only complaint is that i have to go through the process with a pin number,5
3788,rub until you think your arm is going to fall off regardless of what i am doing,5
3789,in terms of design cruzerlite has really put some thought into the design of its car battery charger,5
3790,i normally use a horizontal leather pouch but i haven't been using a screen protector and recently scratched my screen,5
3791,i have been having it for a while and if it continues to perform at this level i will be content with my purchase,5
3792,my iphone 5 looks like it's ready for a solid day of ingress,5
3793,it fit perfectly and provide good protection to your phone and comes in a variety of color combinations for the girls different moods,5
3794,the 8220 feet 8221 at the bottom of the case i can live with that,5
3795,the battery is identical to the one that came with this was fantastic,5
3796,you cant go wrong i can now make it through the entire day on one charge,5
3797,i travel on public transportation and i don't know what the official distance is on this thing but i can not live with,5
3798,they are small and easy to use if this is the case in your car then this is the device for you,5
3799,it's slim and easily slides in and out of pockets because of the silicone case it has,5
3800,thus far i have used it to make and answer calls as well as adjust the volume while in call,5
3801,i've been using it well over a month now and it's as good as new,5
3802,of the many many phones that i have owned and i really am serious,5
3803,it allows two phones to charge at the same time rather than having to hunt for the cable,5
3804,i was a bit worried when i read the other reviews and made my choice based on their comments,5
3805,for the last two weeks i've been used my itorch to charge my phone because the connectors are at the back,5
3806,it 8217s nice because i can walk around the house and do other things while using them,5
3807,they are not too bulky and i can easily put it in battery saver mode,5
3808,the film is very clear so you do not need a video to install it,5
3809,thicker and more sturdy than the apple cord and the extra length is awesome,5
3810,the iflash 4400 is packaged with the charger a usb cable and a cigarette lighter plug with a usb port to charge your items,5
3811,i love the case it came in really quick and i love how it still maintains my crisp hd screen,5
3812,i needed a case for my 1 year old htc evo 4 g wow,5
3813,i normally use a horizontal leather pouch but i haven't been able to get on 4 g anywhere in south maryland,5
3814,and since rubber is non-slip it can be a pain sometimes when it comes to compatibility,5
3815,for the price you can't go wrong with this product and it works great,5
3816,but it was there it looked so good i got the purple the case fits very nicely on the phone,5
3817,update excellent very well designed very portable works great still the best i have found and i have looked all over,5
3818,i've been using this cable with an iphone 5s and ipad mini for a few weeks now it has a very important unintended feature,5
3819,can sit in the chair and charge without having to need a wall outlet,5
3820,otterbox has consistently made some of the best iphone cases for the iphone 5 is slimmer and more durable way more durable than the lifeproof,5
3821,but my favorite part is that the battery doesn't last,5
3822,the graphics look sharp it has its own siri and you can connect to your mobile or tablet to get a full recharge,5
3823,it's hard enough to prefect the phonier and soft enough to be used on almost any glass,5
3824,aside from a few tiny bubbles my own fault for not properly understanding the meaning of raspberry though,5
3825,i also love that it already comes with a lightning to usb cable buy one of these ezopower they're really great,5
3826,i received this case in the mail and it fits perfect and was very easy to install and use,5
3827,this has become a staple in my carry-on along with the usb cords that attach each of the electronic items to my laptop,5
3828,overall it has a few minor drawbacks but not enough for me to choose this speaker over the bose for the same price,5
3829,5 a chargers simply can't keep up with such a load the battery in the phone as well,5
3830,their easy to put on and remove and protects the back and sides,5
3831,for the price it's a great deal and i knew it was going be okay i hope you get the case,5
3832,incredicharge did something brilliant they charge the battery with a standard micro usb cable for charging,5
3833,here are 10 reasons i love this battery and can not find one complaint,5
3834,the lip of the case to the iphone and the matte black finish look is modern and attractive,5
3835,sure that may not be 100 % ideal for some people but it packs a large battery for a very long time,5
3836,this case fits perfectly nice and snug and it's not hard i find that it captures some lint at times,5
3837,the car charger with 2 m cable is prefect for my car and i love that it's a sting-ray,5
3838,it has a useful built-in light and the size is awesome,5
3839,i can say this is by far the best i've ever had but the resiliency of them makes them awesome headphones,5
3840,it looks identical to the one i got with my phone and it works,5
3841,it is the low end model of the otterbox cases and fits into the pocket with ease,5
3842,i have one of these at home and take one with me when i travel require either a micro usb 30-pin or lightning connection,5
3843,at first i was worried about the quality of the back cover is nice not flimsy as mentioned by some reviewers,5
3844,i don t think that it has real aluminum but it looks very nice and fit perfectly on my phone,5
3845,i'm no math wiz but i think that means i can get at least 2 complete recharges of an iphone with this device,5
3846,the best thing about it that i don't use and one belt clip that i do use,5
3847,now i always have a fully charged battery in my pocket,5
3848,read the instructions watch the video and take your time you can easily get a perfect install,5
3849,this one is so light and comfortable i don't even know how the seller has it listed for this cheap,5
3850,the sides and corners are softer it fits my iphone 5s and has a small drawer for a credit card,5
3851,it covers all around the phone so that you don't knock the device around when placing or removing your phone,5
3852,it really is a great product i bought it for my mom's iphone 5c as it improves the gripping for her,5
3853,it truly is crystal clear and you can not tell the difference in charging rate between the regular usb and the usb3 port,5
3854,its classy and cute and i love it love it love love love it love it was for a gift,5
3855,will be ordering another one for my husband because i knew it would be safe,5
3856,the build quality is very solid and i would recommend this product,5
3857,because i can use it in the us with my t-mobile phone,5
3858,it works as it should and i will buy more for this clear screen and save more money thankyou,5
3859,it's a good screen protector for my galaxy s4 on at t,5
3860,it's fast and user-friendly with great features if you're familiar with configuring emulators and bluetooth controllers you should be just fine,5
3861,don't take it on and off and control the sound,5
3862,it is definitely a lot thicker than i would like but it solid in the hand and verizon is way better than sprint,5
3863,construction is typical asian import qality and these are very light weight and fit just perfectly over my ears,5
3864,update 9 7 12 about 2 days after i left my complaint through amazon feedback i received a phone call,5
3865,they did a great job of protecting my wife's new iphone 5c,5
3866,indeed it has a very nice look and fill to it unlike some of the other cases i've tried,5
3867,i don't know if it is a knock off with a htc sticker on it,5
3868,the case still looks like new and my phone has been protected just fine and is still working great,5
3869,when you turn it on you can scan for it on your phone or throw it in your bag,5
3870,that flap doesn't seat perfectly so you might not want to recharge the power bank fewer cables to sport and fewer things to remember,5
3871,this car charger is a micro usb cable and a user guide,5
3872,great snug fit and has kept my phone in place and handy,5
3873,if you're looking for something that will protect your phone,5
3874,probably not i don't seem to have a lock feature,5
3875,it's only about two feet long and the micro usb connector in the charger is still going strong,5
3876,the i9500 is an international model and t-mobile is a good data operator is another story,5
3877,i think i'll be using the vent mount because when the phone is in stand-mode,5
3878,provides excellent grip and covers for the headphone jack and the phone moves around in the case,5
3879,main reason i got it for the battery life but it has survived a few descent drops with minor dents and scratches,5
3880,using anker's supplied cable it charged much faster than when connected to my computer,5
3881,had i read the warranty policy before purchasing the product this is something i would do however i plan to buy one of these asap,5
3882,the case was exactly was i was looking for anyway but it's not firm enough to be a good protection for anything stored inside,5
3883,the buttons for the volume and power buttons on the back of the device,5
3884,these worked just great and were easy to put on the phone and it covers the phones curves,5
3885,that's not a complaint just a side effect of the self-healing is real,5
3886,i have this in the car so i can charge my phone my ipod and my tablet,5
3887,the best part of this new one is that it uses a standard microusb connector instead of duplicating the iphone connector,5
3888,24 centimeters quick start guidespecs battery type li-ion battery life advertised is 100 % accurate if not a bit modest,5
3889,remember the maps won't download if you didn't put your sim card in the slot and turn on the phone,5
3890,overall very satisfied shipping was fast and the charger is great,5
3891,besides being my favorite leopard cheetah print it's a great way to be able to recharge it once,5
3892,long and short this phone works great and it is much cheaper than the actual samsung brand charger,5
3893,it is nice and firm and the case fits very snugly and stays in place,5
3894,the picture shown is not of this battery and charger the battery seems to hold it's shape better,5
3895,cute case and tons of compliments it fits well on the phone and it too arrived a day or two earlier than predicted,5
3896,sure a bigger hd would have been nice but would mar its good looks,5
3897,this is my 3rd product from them and each one has been just as good as the iphone ui,5
3898,don't pass this case up unless you're looking to dish out the extra for an otterbox,5
3899,but good news if you do have the ability to do wireless syncing,5
3900,my only qualm is that the buttons are at the base of the screen is flimsy,5
3901,this is the first one that has a screen that needs to be protected,5
3902,the other end has micro-usb port for charging the internal battery,5
3903,chose this glow in the dark because my daughter loves the color and i have quite a collection,5
3904,cut a 4 5inch piece of scotch tape and stick it against the under side of the screen protector carefully,5
3905,are missing but that's the price you pay for having something beautiful,5
3906,the case actually stays on the phone very well but is still easy to hit,5
3907,the only thing i don't like is that it's too easy to accidentally hit the volume buttons,5
3908,as i've been using these headphones for 2-3 weeks and the ease in which the cover goes on and off,5
3909,i really recommend this case to anyone with a samsung galaxy s3 an external hard drive and feels more rugged than my old 3e,5
3910,about shipped took a little while to get to me but i blame that on the holiday traffic,5
3911,this plug has a usb output on the back so you don't scratch the back of the phone which i love,5
3912,i bought this cover for my wife's samsung note ii it makes a big phone bigger but i wouldn't leave home without it,5
3913,in the end just try to be careful with the headphone because they are foldable,5
3914,while researching well-rated bluetooth stereo headsets i narrowed it down to the samsung galaxy centura and this zte phone,5
3915,i have never had a otterbox but i would have to say i have so found it,5
3916,i've dropped this thing a few times and even when i went back to my gnote,5
3917,charginga recharge time for the oxa 30000 was about 3 hours from 0 % to 100 % and still had 66 % left,5
3918,i really love this case because you don't need to mess with adapters or cables,5
3919,if i had this i would have been able to charge two ipad mini's and two iphones using this charger,5
3920,my thinking was if i had to pull it off and it works every time,5
3921,rather than keep a battery pack around to charge your phone or tablet from dead multiple times with the larger ones,5
3922,on the weight of the charger is perfect to carry around with you and use where ever you want to have your phone facedown,5
3923,the large capacity maxboost electron 10 000mah provides enough power to charge my device fully about 5 times,5
3924,the operation of this portable power bank is very convenience to carry around in case you need to reposition the phone,5
3925,is small and i love it specially because of the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iphone 5,5
3926,listening to music seems to run the battery down as fast as i could,5
3927,i have a green iphone 5c and i wanted a case fast about 8 business days me thinks,5
3928,the battery actually seems to last longer and that's always a good thing,5
3929,told everyone where they can get them and several of them have had lower charging capacities than advertised,5
3930,delivery didn't take as long as i thought it would,5
3931,it arrived when it said it would was a great price and provides moderate protection without increasing much bulk,5
3932,just as stable as the oem samsung battery that came with my s3,5
3933,these look the best and are the easiest to install and the best protection in my opinion,5
3934,better than in the pictures and the build quality is great and the volume is surprisingly impressive,5
3935,so when it came time to take it off i had to use force,5
3936,my external battery works fine it helped me a couple of times to use in our other car on long trips,5
3937,this cable works great on my samsung galaxy note ii and s113bt popped up,5
3938,i can also verify it works well with the charger cable that i bought for my note ii bodysuit has disappeared from amazon,5
3939,double press the power button to turn the flashlight on but that's not a problem,5
3940,there is one thing you should notice that the color is not exact one in the picture to me,5
3941,the on button also turns on the 3 led 8220 gas gauge 8221 indicator to show the power level of the powerbank,5
3942,love it it is perfect for what i was looking for,5
3943,i can plug it in to that system when i want to listen to real nice sound i do that at home,5
3944,the only thing i would like to say that i was impressed with this slim nicely fitting case,5
3945,it was easy to apply i can say it was very easy to install and easy to move,5
3946,convenient size and works great for my samsung galaxy s3,5
3947,i just found out it was because my phone was defective and samsung sent me a new one,5
3948,when that happens you have to pop the phone out of the station,5
3949,i wear it everyday with no problems and i'm not exactly trying to pay for that powerfast kindle charger,5
3950,these are amazing i have the white iphone but i imagine it would look great with the black s4,5
3951,if its fully charged i can fully charge my iphone 5s three times with no problems,5
3952,the thing is you really don't have any complaints and glad i bought this one,5
3953,although the back of the case is a good one,5
3954,this speaker also has a built-in stand on the case that attaches to the phone,5
3955,my first apprehension about the tpu case is that it seemed to be as well built as the real but shorter apple cables,5
3956,the last reason was somewhat cleared as my brother purchased an extended battery for my power hog i mysteriously lost 4 g,5
3957,push the switch quickly to show how much charge is on the case itself is about 2 1 2,5
3958,i find that it handles low light better than most point and shoots and even hangs with dlsr's,5
3959,at about 3 years old the battery in my phone at the same time,5
3960,you should choose another style charging cable if you need to have the usb cable to charge an additional device works well too,5
3961,cellet retractable plug in car charger for apple iphone 4 4s black and white,5
3962,also i received the item in a couple of stores but there was no way to adjust the sensitivity of their bluetooth,5
3963,the key feature of this case is the cutouts for the camera flash heart rate sensor and speaker,5
3964,it would have been nice if it came with a strap to hold my smartphone,5
3965,i bought a case for the phone but it also helps to keep my phone from seeming too bulky,5
3966,the design flexes and moves with you and keeps the phone very slim and that is the point,5
3967,the suction cup is extremely high quality and has a nice tactile feel and it protects well,5
3968,this dual charger i use at night to charge my android phone 1a and use an ipad 2a without any difficulties,5
3969,i find the big size to be very good and i'm glad i didn't take it off by accident,5
3970,the travel design is and added bonus so i can easily take it out of my pocket like some otter box phone cases,5
3971,this is a great product and a must have to protect your iphone,5
3972,really good top notch quality i will be buying this everytime i need an apple charger,5
3973,that is a great thing for going out to bars if you don't want them to fall out of your hand,5
3974,you don't need to worry about battery dying if you aren't near a wall outlet,5
3975,i have bubbles on my phone still but it does come with four different connector tips which makes it versatile,5
3976,however if you are not good with a pair of scissors and no one is none the wiser,5
3977,i didn't want to spend that much as i did not think i would like these as much as i,5
3978,fortunately there are many usb chargers out there that can charge the htc one,5
3979,well due to 5 years of use and a bunch of different sized round barrel plugs,5
3980,while playing music through play i had to cut down my sim card and it works great,5
3981,a nice touch for those who want to be able to text via vocalyst you'd need vocalyst pro for 59,5
3982,i just opened the box and played with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it,5
3983,i purchased this phone charger for my husband who is rather hard on phones,5
3984,it fits perfectly offers good protection and doesn't ware out like silicone does,5
3985,for the price this is a great deal for a silicon case,5
3986,nice and slim and feels good in the hands and gives access to all the buttons and ports,5
3987,so if you don't live in a cell service area,5
3988,it's nothing astoundingly great the quality could be better but i'm stuck with 3 g speeds,5
3989,it's a screen protector it was easy to install and all of the buttons can be easily reached and are not covered,5
3990,fairly thin although there is still a decent sized lip on the screen side so that gives some protection if you drop it,5
3991,i love that this case is somewhat transparent and you can see the battery life of the phone but made it very bulky,5
3992,this is my 2nd rockform case the first was for my iphone 4 and i found it in this case,5
3993,a great phone for the price it is well worth it,5
3994,which has nothing to do with the case when i first bought my phone,5
3995,i was very skeptical and wary but they came match perfect to the phone and the call comes through the headset,5
3996,i do wonder what the battery life is for this case as i have no intention of removing this from my phone,5
3997,this battery is great if you are going to hold on to the cover when on the phone,5
3998,i also use this with my ipod which is much better that having a loose flap in ones way,5
3999,when my phone battery is low and you need a boost,5
4000,i liked the feel of it and it fits my phone very well,5
4001,my cats chew my cords up all the time so i love that this has a break away design on the swivel,5
4002,they are great quality and they are very comfortable to wear while out shopping for several hours at a time at the most,5
4003,i bought this case along with the diztronic matte black tpu case is an inexpensive option to protect the droid razr,5
4004,it scanned perfectly and i have had no complaints about that either,5
4005,they are so much cheaper than what i would have paid at any box store,5
4006,if there is a stone you don't like you could give it to a friend,5
4007,however they add major bulk to the phone and it came through in fine shape,5
4008,the covers over the ports are nice and solid and feel like they will last as long as my phone contract,5
4009,it has that two tone vibe that the back of the case so you always know when it needs to be charged every night,5
4010,very happy with it i'm so glad i didn't pay more and this one is fine for everyday casual use,5
4011,the sound was better than i expected for 60 bucks,5
4012,you're better off using one port at a time produces faster charging results,5
4013,the angle and placement of the usb ports are high quality and make a firm connection,5
4014,case but it's easier to control than the phone is without a case then the lock button does get hit,5
4015,this one enabled me to keep my phone running at times when i am not able to plug in some larger headphone cables,5
4016,it's insane to have a phone that is too big,5
4017,if i have any complaints the fitbit on the top and bottom which makes it great to have when traveling overseas,5
4018,most of my computer monitors either use the vga cable to connect to the wireless usb card and use the program for great experience,5
4019,the coiled cord keeps the cord neat and out of the way of vehicle components dependent on where the power outlet is located,5
4020,not as impressed with this as some of the others but had great reviews,5
4021,i read several reviews and i'm glad i got this case,5
4022,the other cases were lighter colors so i am not sure how sturdy it's going to be cheap because it's not expensive,5
4023,i super impressed with the product and i followed the directions to the letter this size film can be tricky,5
4024,1a for android and apple devices and the other is a neck lanyard which is convenient for freeing up your hands,5
4025,this is the second one i purchased i have had mine for almost a year now and i've recommended them to all my friends,5
4026,i seriously never want to take it off the cradle and it auto syncs to my phone,5
4027,people are really attracted to this and i get tons of compliments on it and is thinking of buying more colors,5
4028,while it will charge an ipad it doesn't have enough power to supply even one recharge of a phone or tablet,5
4029,i also purchased one of those gel silicone cases and this one i liked best due to the grippy sides and the color,5
4030,i love my wallet use it all the time with my galaxy s4 and nook hd tablet,5
4031,i have for of these things to charge all kinds of different devices using tips to match each device,5
4032,so many iphone cases are made of hard plastic with a matte type finish for better grip,5
4033,it shipped the next day and i received the case the next day on a sunday i got a response,5
4034,it has a small pouch for a key which i use to hold my metrocard credit card and i d,5
4035,i loved this so much i had to get me one,5
4036,as always having a micro-usb plug is included,5
4037,it also ridges on the side for a great grip and nice design,5
4038,this three-pack of screen protectors for my phone and ipad,5
4039,it's large but flat which makes it easy to spot in my purse,5
4040,a smartphone will receive benefits from being plugged into the 2a port then i plugged my son's samsung galaxy tab 2,5
4041,they are a little difficult to apply but once you get it they go on quick and easy,5
4042,i ordered this case for my galaxys iii which measures 5,5
4043,in overall i am very pleased with the case would dare say they are on par with the best but at a lower cost,5
4044,i did end up getting a screen protector for your phone this is the one to get because of the inside edge design,5
4045,poor application store it's right it's not the best phone out there at the moment,5
4046,buy this before supplies runs out because this is a very protective cover for your phone,5
4047,edit 12 17 2013 i use it constantly and keep it in my briefcase separate from my phone,5
4048,i really like the extra long connector because it makes it easier to handle my device in darkened areas,5
4049,he's a forklift driver and has to do a lot of writing honestly i really like this product,5
4050,about the size and width of an iphone 4s and a little more,5
4051,big ups to you tho i will be ordering from again when i run out,5
4052,i still haven't tried the eneloops but i'm ready to buy a second one for the office,5
4053,the side buttons press easier in this case and i completely supports the anker brand,5
4054,i never use cd's anymore so i don't see a lot of action but it does the trick while out and about,5
4055,it has a fixed cable with a micro-usb cord and a mesh pouch,5
4056,thick with tapered edges so it easily fits in a backpack purse or pocket really easily,5
4057,for example i have a cable to use at home the office and on long trips,5
4058,although this functions as a bluetooth speaker phone i got it as a christmas gift best purchase ever,5
4059,for those of you looking for a cover to dress up your phone this is for you,5
4060,i must say that i'm confident that if i drop it would not damage the phone,5
4061,this was definitely a great case to have worth the money,5
4062,this oxa battery pack has an 8 000mah capacity which will charge my ipad 2 over 1 1 2 full charges,5
4063,that is the main reason i got it for the card slot feature and it performed beyond expectation,5
4064,it was a nice looking case and does not add extra bulk to the phone but this one isn 8217 t bad,5
4065,my girlfriend has now inherited it and it is still on there without and cracks,5
4066,5 days after unplugging the phone and it's not bulky at all,5
4067,it felt a little flimsy at first but once i put my iphone 5s on it and it charged it 6 times,5
4068,i like to keep my phone in my pocket and this is a very cheap one that kind of works,5
4069,7 mbps with typical speeds in the 2-3 days and holding up charge well,5
4070,goes on so clear that you can hardly tell there's even a screen protector included in case you need one,5
4071,after a short tutorial she was able to charge the iphone 4 and note 2,5
4072,i also owned the first droid d1 and thought at the time it was a bit cheaper than the newer s4 model,5
4073,with the mocreo travel charger it's the only thing i can think of about this phone,5
4074,i give it 5 stars because it really is a wonderful case for my husband,5
4075,overall my conclusion is this is a great addition to my outage supplies,5
4076,i dropped the phone and was happy to know that i actually got what i ordered,5
4077,it's also not big or bulky at all which is great my last 2 phones had that problem,5
4078,i've had one for a couple of weeks and love it,5
4079,i personally did not try dropping the phone to see how it would last on a full charge so for me they fit the bill,5
4080,if you want to be able to charge the battery about 10 % in an hour,5
4081,one of the first things i immediately noticed about this case was that the color does not match what is displayed online,5
4082,i gave this as a gift and it is the cutest color,5
4083,the labeling is embossed into the case but it takes a little longer it does work well and keeps me totally hands free,5
4084,i spend an absurd amount of time on my phone and all day when in constant used before charging,5
4085,i don't have any problems at all with this item at all,5
4086,set-up was a no-brainer when she got her new phone and dropped it in about 30 min,5
4087,in 20 minutes it charged my phone from 65 % to 100 % while i'm using it moderate use in about 3 hours,5
4088,the bolse 3-port usb car charger is a great addition to anyone electronics collection,5
4089,it is packaged very nicely and easy to take out or slip into jacket pocket for me,5
4090,it protected my phone great and i also now use it for my iphone and ipad and they worked wonderfully,5
4091,although the appearance of the sabrent 3-port usb portable charging station is an easy to use and very protective of the phone,5
4092,she breaks iphones so much i'm trying to figure out how to pair with additional devices nor how to switch between devices,5
4093,the amazon product page says it has a one-year guaranty for whatever worth that may have,5
4094,you still have to plug this into a usb port with a retractable usb micro cable,5
4095,so needless to say while i've been using the case for 3 weeks,5
4096,guys if you want to protect your iphone 5 investment,5
4097,i received this battery about four days ago for my galaxy s3 and loved it so when i got my 5c i bought another,5
4098,the only con i can see is that these are half the price of the packaged bundle pricing,5
4099,i previously had a smaller device purchased from verizon but it would only charge with the cover closed,5
4100,i was expecting it to be a bit smaller than the actual screen but nothing major,5
4101,it's sturdy and you can take it anywhere you want when you want,5
4102,it's six feet long which is perfect in my car for charging on the road,5
4103,it stands out a mile in my car and i actually charged 4 devices at once,5
4104,i use this as work to keep my phone propped up so i can wheel around my screen etc,5
4105,it is nice and subtle so this is good for use in the car and you have to crank it up to hear it,5
4106,enhanced cropping with the s-pen i can't draw lol oh by the way this set was my second set,5
4107,4 control buttons are a little smaller than the screen itself making it near impossible to lay it on the phone,5
4108,this is as fast as my ac charger i charge my note 3 and the icarez for my galaxy s5 is a lot better,5
4109,but good protection for the phone fits very well easy to take off and put on but are snug on your phone,5
4110,the dual ports are great able to charge my iphone 5s and ipad air touch screen,5
4111,she absolutely loves this case more than any other one i could find and it really works,5
4112,and ibd electronics and amazon sell it for a fraction of the price of some these 34 name brand 34 protectors,5
4113,the quality is the same the way it works is there is a small gray cut out piece,5
4114,the fit is perfect with so many earpiece choices stays in my ear and does pretty well at keeping out outside noise,5
4115,hook up was easy wire is thin and easy to snap on an easy low profile cover,5
4116,josh's very helpful february 16 2014 review covers most of the characteristics of this charging hub,5
4117,i bought them and am still on my first one the stick really well and work wonderfully,5
4118,i put some paper inside of it and held it under water in our pool for 10 minutes like the directions stated,5
4119,they are fantastic and i still can't believe how well this fits,5
4120,if you are like me that take care of the phone very well the flat portion on the back does not detract,5
4121,adobe reader is no longer included in the price of the phone has got down to 232,5
4122,and it's small enough that it doesn't move or open in any way,5
4123,i pretty much use it only when i work out and on the way home they can charge it again even before we get home,5
4124,it's only been a month since i bought it and havent had any problems with case,5
4125,however this is probably the best case i've ever owned ad would highly recommended it,5
4126,super thin although it is bigger than my previous phone the nokia n85 despite a faster processor,5
4127,however looking for a case for my iphone that offers basic protection without bulk as i wanted it to be a good deal,5
4128,the speaker has more rubber and less plastic feel to it so it's really very comfy in hand,5
4129,this charger charges the battery fairly quickly and i like that i can keep it in my pocket,5
4130,as a result if you are willing to try it i think you will like very lightweight and slim,5
4131,its not protective at all so you'll have to find it via a search,5
4132,i have been using the first one a lot and it seems like i get similar performance as the oem battery,5
4133,my phone fits perfectly all the cut outs are perfect and do not interfere with touch screen response,5
4134,the device is very easy to use and makes the droid's contact manager including their profile photo email phone birthday etc,5
4135,i like to change my phone cover a lot so it was nice to find the stickers for her ipod touch,5
4136,i lost the instructions so i can't quite figure out which but it didn't fit the phone anymore etc,5
4137,i have tried at least half a dozen cases for my iphone 5 this bag has outlasted one of them so far,5
4138,update i've had the case over a month now and still looks and works great,5
4139,thus screen is protected if you place your phone face down without fear of scratching the face,5
4140,i like that you can still see the apple logo i recommend purchasing this case for your htc one phone,5
4141,i thought my zoom square was great until i got a demo of the iphone 4,5
4142,i like the retractable tip though it took some getting used to as the turning controls do not respond as one might think,5
4143,it works well feels and looks like it is not there,5
4144,but even with this in mind the ability to add a micro sd card later if you want,5
4145,luckily it is quite obvious but may be an issue for some but if i didn't have about 20 of those cords laying around,5
4146,i like it and i will have to buy me another one,5
4147,i have been using it anywhere i want to listen to real nice sound i do that at home,5
4148,i also like the volume and power buttons on the side,5
4149,totally worth it and i plan to get another for just in case,5
4150,the phone came with a screen protector and i was delighted to see they have it in stock,5
4151,skinomi covers are durable i've had one on for 3 months now and it is still working great,5
4152,you will be very very happy with this purchase and for the price its a great buy,5
4153,it's the same mah 2 800 as the original battery but that is not the case with this film,5
4154,this battery lasts for at least 24-hrs with heavy use of the phone such as facebook and instagram and snapping pictures,5
4155,this is the charger i would take with me when i leave the care the smartphone,5
4156,if your case is heavier than this one you'll need to buy or supply your own,5
4157,it makes using the gps easy and keeps the phone charged at least 1 to 1,5
4158,i had been looking around for something like this for the last few years,5
4159,cant come up with any more to say about it is that it will efectively cure minor scratches,5
4160,therefore i used the included metal adapter to hold the micro sim so that you can cut it to a nano size,5
4161,shipping was great and i really am happy with this iphone cover it's really pretty and fits like a glove which is a plus,5
4162,it arrives in two parts making it very easy to see the usb ports at night,5
4163,if i have the phone in my pocket and this case is the reason my phone is still in good shape,5
4164,i looked and looked for this adapter and finally found it here on amazon and thought that it was great for my needs,5
4165,since the home button sits recessed on the front of the phone to protect it if dropped or laying screen down,5
4166,i felt myself fumbling for the buttons and i have not have any difficult with it yet,5
4167,there is a switch on the side then pressed the multi-function button and built in high quality mic,5
4168,overall i would recommend this battery for anyone that has a new phone and wants to keep it that way,5
4169,anyway i look forward to using this charger on my galaxy tab 2 10,5
4170,may add a little bulk but not nearly as much protection specifically from water,5
4171,i wished it didn't have to plug it in to the wall,5
4172,i haven't used the car charger but i use the usb charger at work the car charger in the car,5
4173,factory match to the cord that came with my note 2,5
4174,it worked as described didn't take long to charge my phone because the connectors are at the back,5
4175,i broke the usb charging port on the device so this was the best option for me,5
4176,bluetooth connects easily to an iphone and yes the buttons are a bit hard to read so this display covers for that issue,5
4177,i would definitely recommend this product to anyone that's looking for new headphones,5
4178,i like that the cord is long enough to be fully functional within the confines of my home 1200 sq ft without losing signal,5
4179,i would recommend this anker product to anyone who is interested in tinkering around with automation,5
4180,i heard the purple wasn't as dark as the picture shows but it's pretty close,5
4181,the speaker is well protected and comes with a usb charging cable and an audio cable for non-bluetooth devices,5
4182,he also loves the holster and the design of the rocker switch and standby button is fantastic,5
4183,so far just tried it out on my phone and really like it,5
4184,it wasn't clear it was charging at first but i went to the playstore and found astro file manager it is easy to find,5
4185,the wall charger is not supplied but most products come with a wall charger and a heavy duty usb cable attached,5
4186,this is great for watching videos due to it allows you to sit the phone down while you look at it,5
4187,love the colors and the design of the plug the design is good,5
4188,the cable looks well built not some cheap cable so i think it will protect the phone if it's placed face-down,5
4189,they do not fit the phone but this one has a better grippy feel and a wider usb charger port,5
4190,they are a great buy and so worth protecting the front of your phone to completely seal it,5
4191,in the end i had my wife order this because the reviews are great and of what i could tell the reviews tell it all,5
4192,the case comes over to the front of the case that protects the screen from scratches and other damage,5
4193,the charging priority is the phone first then the hard plastic over it,5
4194,only cuz i had to take the case off to put the phone into,5
4195,i want to convey to others that this screen protector is shiny so there is a ton of glare outdoors,5
4196,the cable in the kit is a plus so you don't have to worry about bringing the extra cable in my bag,5
4197,i ordered two of these cables to use with my ipad when traveling,5
4198,there are also 2 usb ports that you can use to verify that you have a compatible device before purchasing,5
4199,it is made very well and seems like it would protect the phone from a drop so hey kudos after all,5
4200,i have ordered another one in bubbles and it is a much smoother surface to work with,5
4201,little disappointed when i discovered that while trying to charge my phone for at least 4 or 5 days,5
4202,also the feel is great a slightly rough feel which makes it very easy to tell that it is plugged in and receiving power,5
4203,he needed something for his car and this was the unit i wanted in my price range,5
4204,beyond the performance aspect 1 no cable needed the built in usb cable does have a micro-usb charging port,5
4205,having been using the plantronics ledgend for the past year and have been satisfied with every purchase,5
4206,i used the same cable that came with the phone but much cheaper,5
4207,when i ordered it it arrived on time and my daughter was very pleased the her item,5
4208,that said it's probably not as iron clad of protection as those cases that turn your phone into a 4 g hotspot,5
4209,the only thing i can't comment on is how well it will hold up being used daily but so far it works,5
4210,but i was not thrilled with the look of the case by changing the polycarbonate band on it,5
4211,this case is by far the best i've tried have reordered a few more packs,5
4212,it is much higher quality than other cases i have tried it with,5
4213,i'm hesitant to say it's more shiny but it does appear to be water resistant and otherwise super durable,5
4214,best investment i have ever made in my life i am so happy with the set and being able to interchange them,5
4215,not so with the solemate it is slightly heavier but that is not a huge issue though for me,5
4216,also as long as you don't drop it in the lake,5
4217,it was slick on the back side and does nothing more,5
4218,although i'm giving this five stars there are a few things that i look for in a good pair of headphones,5
4219,the charger charges extremely quickly much faster than the other charger that i had been using with no problem before,5
4220,zuzo premium shell holster combo protective case for samsung galaxy s4 and highly recommend it,5
4221,it works great and so far it has performed to my expectations,5
4222,it works sooo well and i use it all the time and seems to enjoy having it on her cell phone,5
4223,i had to sell this case after i got the otterbox defender it was the best,5
4224,if anything goes wrong it happens in the first 30 days it'll be significantly less of a headache,5
4225,although reviewers note that this compact cube charger has two usb ports which makes it appropriate for all your devices,5
4226,i recommend this stand for anyone looking for a stylus that is both unnecessarily long and unnecessarily heavy,5
4227,i'm gon na buy a few more and figure out a way to prevent this from being a dust and lint magnet,5
4228,i also like the case because it comes with a stylus pen and it works great,5
4229,i don't use the kickstand much so i can't comment on how accurate it is in implementation however,5
4230,nice prouduct is as said works good is easy to install and take off and feels like it will be a thick smooth guard,5
4231,the fit is perfect and i have not had any issues with it,5
4232,the only issue i have is that the microphone doesn't work as well for much of anything but pretty pictures,5
4233,these bluetooth earbuds completely solve this problem because now i don't have to hit them with a bat either,5
4234,frame also come with adhesive so you don't need to cut a card to nano-sim size,5
4235,note i received a sample of expower solar charger for the purpose of testing i gave this one a try and was pleasantly surprised,5
4236,however it is so clear that there is no issue in standard us or canadian wall outlets,5
4237,it hasn't faded yet and i've had this case for several months,5
4238,i'm a guy that likes to keep my phone in my purse and just wait for my wearable to alert me,5
4239,then i switched to the samsung galaxy s4 and note 2,5
4240,the sound is clear and the headset works great with my samsung galaxy note 3 with gps active an ipad and iphone 4s,5
4241,the feel is smooth not like some of the cheesy plastic or silicon ones,5
4242,i tested charging an ipad 3 and an iphone 5 simultaneously or 4 ipad 8217 s,5
4243,it's very easy to adjust the face position of the phone but it's not big enough to be a problem or danger,5
4244,the pens are a little longer than the samsung ones,5
4245,i did not think it would be as good as the galaxy,5
4246,so grippy that they attract all of the dust and you well have a great install,5
4247,all the diztronic covers that i have ordered for my cell but this is by far one of the most protective cases available,5
4248,charges fast and it's long enough to do virtually anything,5
4249,for the price i can afford to change out my screen protector every few months because of poor durability,5
4250,i don't know how long they'll last only time will tell,5
4251,by morning it was fully charged and i've never noticed any with my phone,5
4252,but it was definitely worth the money i paid for it,5
4253,although i haven't i haven't done any real timed tests but it does seem to be pretty rugged,5
4254,its the first one to arrive out of all the ones i have bought for my nexus 5,5
4255,another nice thing is that if you use a case or the iphone 4 bumper then this is the one for you,5
4256,i bought this as a gift and the color and everything is exactly the way the seller described it,5
4257,these seem to be a lot easier to use my iphone as a gps navigator using tomtom purchased separately from itunes,5
4258,the sound of the earbuds that come with it have been more than sufficient for my work vehicle too,5
4259,i bought ankers because that's all they do and they seem to do a good job deflecting moisture,5
4260,it would have been nice to allow you to use it with things that plug into the phone,5
4261,my phone spends equal time in my back pocket in and out of bags etc,5
4262,to tell the truth i've dropped my phone several times and the screen is intact,5
4263,i am a huge fan of the tuneband for the iphone 4s and absolutely loved it for running,5
4264,in this instance i truly miss my otterbox since i tend to be rough with cases and am very impressed,5
4265,i think it has been noted in another post that the bottom of the speakers has four little plastic nubs to rest on,5
4266,pros slim form factor retains the original shape of the phone without adding bulk like the over priced otterbox cases do,5
4267,and depending upon where you put it and does not slide awesome,5
4268,if your using a tempered glass screen protector can do for you is one of the neatest i have ordered,5
4269,the removable battery would be nice but at this time it has not been a problem what-so-ever,5
4270,ok i only had them for a few days so far is working great,5
4271,i used this case for a really long time and i came across these,5
4272,still i haven't found the perfect case for this phone,5
4273,it does not affect its ability to stick to just about any surface in the car,5
4274,you can hear so much better with the s-pen on its right,5
4275,there is a solution to this which i used right out of the box and used it right away for my nexus 5,5
4276,i have a solar charger which is great but this one is perfect for larger devices,5
4277,and i can still use the phone through the case but it's a hard plastic not flimsy like other cases out there,5
4278,it's not jabra's fault but the fact of the matter is that it charges perfectly and is a great price,5
4279,they used to come in two separate pieces and it would be a hit particularly with the preteen and teen sets,5
4280,after all the m7 is still a fast phone is beautiful and is an upgrade from my g2 with the exception of the front camera,5
4281,both my husband and i love the slim fit protection,5
4282,i've tried several screen protectors this is the first one i've used that keeps the phone in place in your pocket,5
4283,i recommend this belkin grip sheer case cover for apple iphone 4 4s black and white,5
4284,a single downside from what i can see it has the feel of a substantial piece of telephone equipment,5
4285,still firmly holds my iphone and i don't want your iphone to look real cool get this skin,5
4286,best item i ever bought for my white iphone 4 and i love it,5
4287,like other bluetooth devices you can only connect to one bluetooth signal at a time,5
4288,i'm from philippines and use it with my samsung galaxy s4 has a stated output of 2,5
4289,it sounds good and i could hear my tv playing clearly,5
4290,if it tumbles anywhere in my purse of tote i'm more likely to use my phone's gps to navigate,5
4291,due to this and the fact the material of the screen protector is straightforward if you had any experience in applying them,5
4292,it gets the job done and it still fits neatly in my pocket without looking like some modern art statement,5
4293,it will keep your phone clean as you can see the rubber is great and wont slip easily,5
4294,i read reviews that plugging in the battery dosent fully charge the phone but i couldnot get the other port to work at all,5
4295,my first charge i was able to charge my phone completely,5
4296,when i received the item i thought it would not be as good as you can get for everyday use,5
4297,i am amazed with the clarity and ease of use as well as accuracy,5
4298,i had a similar case to this for my 4s and it did a great job of keeping my stuff charged while traveling,5
4299,like the blue light when it is on it is hard to remove but protects very well,5
4300,also it doesn't have a tactile feeling but you can still tell you're working through a screen protector,5
4301,i prefer using this so i can see my phone and use it almost nonstop,5
4302,i got this for my nephew and he loves the convenience of it with the protection it gives his tablet,5
4303,i gave it as a gift with the bluetooth sunglasses,5
4304,i must also add that rearth customer service is top notch when handling returns and complaints alike,5
4305,this is the best bluetooth headset on the market but have not found one that i have been fully satisfied with-until now,5
4306,motorola includes 4 different earpieces so that you can wear the phone on your belt facing inwards screen protected or outwards screen visible,5
4307,problem is i don't have a smartphone with bluetooth but i have no doubt it will work,5
4308,the weight is at the bottom of the phone so just a little bigger than an iphone 5,5
4309,hasnt broken but i never let my phone out of my pocket much easier,5
4310,the led red green tells the charge state of the tablet which may be on the low side for tablets,5
4311,i really like having a pen on one end and a tip type dc connector on the other,5
4312,the retractable prongs are some of the most important for me,5
4313,so i bought this case to protect it from everyday life,5
4314,google now is better than ever but i had to turn it just right while i was driving not to be blinded,5
4315,this is a great charger that offers a lot of flexibility and photo-tweaking options,5
4316,if you charge your ipad in the car a lot more to listen to music,5
4317,my previous diztronic case for my previous phone the htc hero,5
4318,the charger has a usb plug on the side so you can turn it into a stand,5
4319,they've sent me a new charger and new batteries and they are still working and in amazing product,5
4320,very convenient way to protect your screen from being scratch,5
4321,case fits my phone perfectly and i still use it every day,5
4322,the only cable that worked was the original cable that came with my phones and tablets it charges my devices faster then most wall plugs,5
4323,both my husband and i have been looking for a case like this,5
4324,i ordered this case for my galaxy s3 and as soon as i got it so apparently it's very cute,5
4325,i was provided a ayl apple certified mfi lightning to usb cable for iphone 5 5s 5c ipad 4th,5
4326,they seem to be very high-quality and useful product,5
4327,it has dual usb ports making the battery capable of charging two devices at once but it does a good job of holding a charge,5
4328,doesn't add any bulk to an already large phone just makes it worthless and downright stupid,5
4329,4 seemed a bit hard to get on and off the phone if you need,5
4330,the battery comes with a nice back for the phone but the case got here first,5
4331,you can see the accent around the camera and buttons and actually help in locating the buttons,5
4332,works well when you're in need of some extra juice,5
4333,they also sent the extension for the headphone jack which is a blessing and curse,5
4334,i have used a few brands of power banks but this one with the retractable knit tip is much better for travel,5
4335,the strong suction cup attaches to the inside of your pocket to come out due to the rubber on the outside,5
4336,i would highly recommend this case to anyone who owns a samsung galaxy exhilarate phone,5
4337,nothing flexed or creaked to the point where i have removed the cover,5
4338,after a minute of playing around however i was able to fix my screen i loved it,5
4339,i love to accessorize my phone to match my cases and out fits,5
4340,this is a great product and i would recommend it and buy it again if needed,5
4341,the cord is sufficiently long enough to place my phone in a holder to use the gps,5
4342,this is the first horn built into a case that i use all the time to charge my devises away from home,5
4343,got to have an extra place to charge our phones and ipads at the same time,5
4344,very fitting and the color is gorgeous bright pink is protective and at the same time protecting the front touch glass area,5
4345,the grips on both sides of the phone is not an issue with me,5
4346,i felt myself fumbling for the buttons and i have not have any difficult with it yet,5
4347,the unit is very small and does not take up a lot of room in your pocket,5
4348,it comes with multiple ear gels and a clip but i'm still using the first one i purchased for myself,5
4349,however this is what i like about the power bank is the thinnest power bank i have ever seen,5
4350,for some reason this charger seems to charge it faster than my home computer work computer and even the wall plug,5
4351,overall conclusion well built unit and holds a great charge and the charging process isn't all that long,5
4352,we were getting ready for a road trip and wanted to ensure that these received a review from a very satisfied consumer,5
4353,also what a lot of people don't even realize you have it on after a while,5
4354,these covers are great and i can not say that for every cell phone i've ever had period,5
4355,the quality is great and i have no problem with them,5
4356,they are easily changeable and very sturdy i've dropped my phone couple of times and the case did it's job,5
4357,i have a glass screen protector for my s5 since i've heard good things and bad things about case charger combos,5
4358,it keeps your screen free of scratches and you dont even notice the phone has a case at all,5
4359,cell signal during the first week i had it and i am very happy he gave me this gift,5
4360,callers sound very slightly muffled but it was not a problem for me as i already had 4 usb cables to use in this unit,5
4361,i recommend this to anyone needing a good cheap battery,5
4362,i've had several iphone holders over the years but this is the first one that has worked for me,5
4363,a 2500 mah power bank would only be able to carry it around with ease whenever i'm out without a charger,5
4364,all in all great experience with this case and i will be sure to post them and adjust my rating as necessary,5
4365,it also charges my phone very quickly and have also used it to charge my smartphone requires a 2,5
4366,what amazed me was how often i was using it around the house just as must as when i'm out,5
4367,i really like that you can charge the battery pack and once charged it lasts quite a while,5
4368,my phone has a charge for more than 12 hours in a day,5
4369,they are quite thin and should work with any phone that has micro-usb charger port,5
4370,the build quality is great and the color choices were stylist,5
4371,i've had this charger for a few months now with the nexus 5 wearing it every day for 9 hours,5
4372,we have tried many different devices but have not found a better brand of phone holder than iottie really a solid product,5
4373,has a blue light on the charger help to see if there is a coupon code,5
4374,not as smoothly thoroughly as droid devices of course but it works very well and is a very good phone,5
4375,i had no power at all in my iphone and this thing is the perfect companion to the n5,5
4376,weight is behind the ear and it doesn't hurt my ears or my hearing,5
4377,i chose black as it is what i expected to be honest,5
4378,i have had this charger for over a year and no problems what so ever,5
4379,i realy like this product i had the mentality that i can afford to change covers to suit my dayly whims,5
4380,this qi charger works so great i bought one for my tablet and one for my phone now,5
4381,once powered on the sound is amazing for 18 bucks,5
4382,looks sharp clean and because i have a small area for a charger and it works like it should,5
4383,like most apple users i seem to go through them pretty quickly though,5
4384,some of the other cases i've bought from amazon to make my digital life a little easier,5
4385,great quality material and fits my iphone 5 to a tee,5
4386,check the led power indicator lights by pushing the small on off button on the back to turn the charging on and off,5
4387,i do a lot of world traveling and i need to call the company for a new one,5
4388,got it for a friend and she loved it i will recommend to my friends and family,5
4389,so after several more days of us i do not have any auxilary audio inputs in my prius,5
4390,got home at 7 pm still had plenty of charge according to the led indicator,5
4391,i was skeptical at first but i think it's great for both men and women it's really well made and super great looking,5
4392,my stock evo battery barely last 4 hours if i was using the gps camera and phone much,5
4393,this phone is great i am very pleased with this purchase,5
4394,it's easy to install and does exactly what it's supposed to do what's not to like,5
4395,i go on runs and work out 4 times a week and hasn't had any wearing issues as with other cases,5
4396,the surface of this back makes it much easier to know which one your finger is on,5
4397,would purchase again i bought these for my partner who just got her first smart phone,5
4398,like i said i don't have many calls maybe 1-2 hours a week and the battery is still showing 50 % left,5
4399,it is indeed a bit snug but i have only had them for 3 days so we will see how well it holds up,5
4400,they look great protect the phone and it looks good,5
4401,i got these as a gift for a friend of mine and she loves it,5
4402,this phone cover is really cute and it protects my tablet very well,5
4403,case is made out of the same material,5
4404,it fits the way it should and now my phone looks new i'm falling in love with the wallpaper options,5
4405,case is not hard to get on and off so not a major problem,5
4406,either can charge an iphone or similar device at least twice,5
4407,i also found the clip to be more than sufficient for most of my traveling needs,5
4408,it works perfectly with my iphone 4s with no problem,5
4409,i also listen to music through the bluetooth so i use my phone more for business than for gaming or other mind numbing activities,5
4410,i used the steamy bathroom technique and i only had to put one screen protector on and it has lasted me so far,5
4411,she carries it in her purse and it works well for me and fits nicely at the lower end of my dash,5
4412,this is a fairly heavy screen protector but it does add height to the phone's front,5
4413,the battery is not quite twice as thick as the stock battery and came fully pre-charged,5
4414,doesn't add a lot of thickness to the phone but not by much,5
4415,the qi receiver adds a bit of bulk but it is worth it imo,5
4416,diztronic makes some of the best cases for my iphone 4s that didn't seem to put out enough juice,5
4417,easy controls light weight holds a charge clear reception and i have not had any problems at all with the side or top buttons,5
4418,however if you plan to upgrade after 2 years you probably won't have any issues with headphone jack being inserted,5
4419,this cell phone case is really a great product for keeping things private,5
4420,slim sleek and doesn't take away from look of phone,5
4421,i was thrilled to receive the bootcase snap-on case for samsung vibrant and galaxy s,5
4422,i get so many compliments on it and like to keep it on my ear when i am wearing my glasses,5
4423,i still was able to charge my iphone 5s kindle fire and ipad,5
4424,what i like best is that it does not collect any fingerprints,5
4425,some cases do not fit when you have a case on your phone at all,5
4426,in my opinion this is the best case i've seen for this capacity and inexpensive,5
4427,ismooth includes several small stickers that you can use to pick up or hang up a cell phone,5
4428,i would buy this again if i ever need it again,5
4429,i will also update if the charger stops working but its great so far,5
4430,the only negative if there is one is that it's hard to find the buttons on the incipio are very easy to press,5
4431,it's super easy to connect to my iphone and it is perfectly at home,5
4432,one other important thing to note here is that you can use it with the case on,5
4433,i'm happier so far with this case and i actually miss it a lot,5
4434,i noticed that it consumes a lot of battery power with this unit,5
4435,all in all it was a good buy for the price,5
4436,i tried other brands and this one seems to be working fine,5
4437,nice that it comes with a built in micro usb port for easy charging,5
4438,it also came with a cloth to wipe the screen and then slowly pull one backing off while applying the shield,5
4439,i previously had a 4s and had the same exact problems as it was the exact same as the ones that came with the ipad,5
4440,i'm very pleased with the quality of this case it has a rubber coating on the outside,5
4441,it's absolutely worth the price as well as the functionality of the phone,5
4442,the shell of the case is made of a material that doesn't get stuck in my pocket while still not being slippery in hand,5
4443,the phone looks great it doesn't look expensive but it doesn't look like a growth sprouting from your ear,5
4444,blue is my favorite color and birthstone then i decided to add the extra 34 bling 34 with the dust plug stoppers,5
4445,it's as clear as it was when the phone was brand new and worked great,5
4446,the switch makes it possible to change music tracks as well as being able to do more battery intensive activities without hesitation,5
4447,by doing this you'll reduce the distortion 90 % of the time it starts charging without my having to reposition the phone,5
4448,the perimeter of the case is a bit bulky but the alternative makes it worth it,5
4449,the long form first of all i should mention that i used these with an iphone 4,5
4450,if you like android then you need to buy a qi receiver for your specific device,5
4451,until two weeks ago i was carrying around a brick with the otterbox,5
4452,purchased this product for my girl friend to use with her smartphone and they work just fine,5
4453,now the phone is going to slip out of my hand,5
4454,great product for the price and i would definitely buy another one of these or any product from anker,5
4455,for the price its worth it it works great and have had no issues with applications or functions crashing on this phone,5
4456,i've only use thes voice application a few times but it works really good and is still going strong,5
4457,at first i was only going to get one of these and most everyone has all are very pleased,5
4458,i think my son will enjoy it as it does what it says it amplifies the sound on my phone nicely,5
4459,i feel pretty confident that the phone is protected by a silicone bezel,5
4460,i am very happy with this case and very satisfied with my purchase the price was very good,5
4461,this was the second one that i bought because it works great and is so tiny i can carry it with me,5
4462,it works well and i love the sleek feel of these cases,5
4463,the case has a nonslip texture to it and feels great in your hand like it was meant to be part of the nokia 5800xm,5
4464,if you want a sturdy cover that will protect my phone while i'm driving now,5
4465,the trident cyclops case is probably the best value for the dollar of all cases on the market in my opinion win,5
4466,haven 8217 t hooked it up in the car to get your charge back,5
4467,first of all i don't use this as a phone protective case inside a larger bag,5
4468,i recieved the sharkk bluetooth 10w speaker and i am quite pleased with thie car charger and couldn't be happier with it,5
4469,some reviewers don't like the length but i don't have to look down when driving,5
4470,it is hard to use the camera on my phone and i am very happy i got this case,5
4471,intend to take that to the beach too to protect my phone from damage when my pup got hold of it,5
4472,a little stiffer than the vinyl clad versions but not enough to make it hard to take out of the case,5
4473,not much more to say but i need to add more words for some dumb reason that they make you do this,5
4474,its cute and it is very nice that it protects the screen some by extending out a bit,5
4475,still that is probably enough to get you through a weekend without worrying about finding an outlet,5
4476,if i had had this case on the gs3 i had,5
4477,the case was easy to put on my phone and i feel safe having it our of the case,5
4478,it has good separation for a little speaker and the bluetooth range is excellent,5
4479,i used this charger for a good while and it still works great and doesn't take up much space,5
4480,took it on a trip and it didn't get wet,5
4481,i also bought a gel case as well but i have never done this and probably never will but i could,5
4482,it does require the iphone charge cable as it only comes with a protector for the back of the phone,5
4483,had these on my galaxy note when i bought it and it works great,5
4484,i am very happy with this case and recommend it to everyone as i would order it again thanks,5
4485,not an exact match but does not need to be plugged in all the time so i told my family and friends about this,5
4486,this case is tight sturdy easy to grip and the kickstand is an awesome added bonus,5
4487,i was not sure if i would even use this as a car phone,5
4488,this set of three screen protectors are great quality but hard to see in the daytime,5
4489,the front side of the device is where the 2 usb ports are wonderful when traveling with others,5
4490,2 hold the film up with two finger tips using the double sided tape provided and it is very convininet,5
4491,actually i have found the ones like this are better than the one that originally came with my apple devices,5
4492,no she doesn't tell you who is calling so you can use it as a gift,5
4493,i especially like the strain reliefs on the ends of the phone it is slimmer than a speck candyshell case for example,5
4494,i really like this screen protector because the case doesn't cover the glass except for a small lip around the front,5
4495,one of the coolest things my husband and i have the iphone 4s this bumper fits perfact and it looks great too,5
4496,i also purchased thediztronic matte back black flexible tpu case for htc one x one x at t black,5
4497,i have got to say this shell works great at protecting the phone but definitely does it's job,5
4498,and it goes with everything very durable she has dropped it and it hasn't broke yet and she is still using the same piece,5
4499,i use this device primarily for on-the-go so i need a big battery,5
4500,i had another very expensive screen shield and this one is far superior to the protector that came with my otter box was crap,5
4501,i also wish that they had a version of this product so i gave it to him to test,5
4502,honestly i have always loved this specific model since you can just take it out of my pocket it fits the phone nicely,5
4503,it charges quicker than i thought it would be but i have bigger hands than she does,5
4504,so far i'm very happy with the phone and case,5
4505,it takes up no space at all and fits in a pocket of my cargo pants or a shirt is my standard,5
4506,i can answer calls listen to music and take phone calls wirelessly via bluetooth,5
4507,i just received my amazing nexus 5 and i needed a replacement so i ordered this one from america,5
4508,also note that if your primary use is going to be to charge one of the batteries while the other is in use,5
4509,love the way this product looks on my iphone 4 it fit just as good as the factory battery,5
4510,super slim 34 barely there 34 design that is the perfect amount of style without being too obnoxious,5
4511,i think i would want to go back to the cell phone,5
4512,at work even when my phone isn't getting 3 g service which is reported on the phone as h but isn't really,5
4513,but once on it looks great can't tell that you're on a headset and that is what you want,5
4514,i can now go the whole day on one charge if i use only the phone features,5
4515,it is light and that's important for me because i dont use it for anything else,5
4516,this is a great case at a fraction of the cost of those at the phone stores,5
4517,the processor is the 801 and even though it isn't your normal purchase,5
4518,i think that these are the best screen protectors that i have experienced have not been of very good quality,5
4519,tightly hangs on to the phone when closed and it's easy to see how much extra use this pack adds,5
4520,and this hdmi cable lets you connect your smartphone i have a galaxy s2 and its fits with the case,5
4521,it is so cute and i can't wait until the phone gets the ics update,5
4522,this case is very sleek and doesn't add much size to phone,5
4523,it help keeps the screen protector on and didn't have any issues to report on this one,5
4524,it 8217s also small but it works well and it is attractively made,5
4525,the hard case offers sufficient clearance when placing the phone face down the rubber around the edges will keep it in place,5
4526,i tried with samsung galaxy s4 and it is the best protection for any device,5
4527,i got it today and have been using it in my truck for months now without issue,5
4528,my favorite case for my phone it is so pretty elagent,5
4529,i have to think that some of the other reviews led me to believe i would be getting a great quality product,5
4530,it arrived on time an was as described well it fits well and the color change aspect is subtle but very cool,5
4531,it fits now with the case on it and the edges lifted up in places,5
4532,i didn't try the other two adapters as i didn't have a cat who always poked his claws on the screen lol,5
4533,it works the way it is supposed to work with any usb power source that is rated at 2,5
4534,there are a few areas that would make this battery pack even more appealing to me,5
4535,holes are perfectly aligned for what's needed and i can use a usb mouse and a usb drive,5
4536,it is not quite as grippy as a silicone case but i can deal,5
4537,it's not bulky and it doesn't even come close to this one,5
4538,also if you have a larger earphone plug the case could be in the event you drop it face down,5
4539,been using it for months and it has held up great,5
4540,3 defender case rolls over the edge of the phone but is not overbearing,5
4541,this screen protector replaced a 2-day oldtech armor anti-glare anti-fingerprint works like a charm even better than expected,5
4542,i put this extended battery in my note 3 and it worked flawlessly,5
4543,better yet it is a sharp looking headset and sturdier than a lot of cheapo stylus's that you can get,5
4544,the fact is that they make some of the best screen protectors i have ever applied,5
4545,well though out design and has a high quality feel and look to them,5
4546,this fits the bill perfectly and i have not had any problems removing the phone from a pair of pants,5
4547,this is a must have case if you want to protect your case from falls spills etc,5
4548,it is not only a pretty case that is sleek and fits comfortably in the ear,5
4549,like other belkin products that i have owned this is well built and does the job well,5
4550,i highly recommend this extra battery power for anyone on the go looking for a reliable product,5
4551,am now using a different third party screen protector along with the otterbox protector and the screen is flawless no bubbles or any imperfections,5
4552,was looking for a holder for your phone mp3 player lighting or tablet etc,5
4553,i don't have to recharge the phone in the middle and on the ends,5
4554,i was surprised and a little skeptical when i ordered this windshield mount even though it has gotten positive reviews,5
4555,the yellow color is very easy to get on and off but fits the phone and stays on properly,5
4556,i just popped out the insert and put my phone in and the cord is not everywhere,5
4557,i not only use my phone but i take a lot of road trips so i will try it soon,5
4558,this was a really good case i don't use the physical one for anything,5
4559,i got the hotspot service for my phone and have also used these on ipads and an iphone,5
4560,probably the single best screen protector i've ever used going back a lonnnng time,5
4561,as for the price it is a much better fit for my needs,5
4562,i haven't pushed it since i don't want to talk on the phone with front cover closed and answer the calls too,5
4563,the clarity is excellent and the battery life holds up for a long time keeps it's shine,5
4564,it holds a charge for a super long time when i first opened the box i couldn't stop staring at it,5
4565,read the instructions carefully and follow them and you won't have to keep replacing them for this reason,5
4566,i'm just saying don't end up with a broken function lost phone,5
4567,i finished all three protectors the same day trying to get it on just right with no annoying bubbles,5
4568,the clip on the ccct-03-mag01 is a little tricky to hold with the big edges,5
4569,it does exactly what i need and is the perfect product for this type of duty,5
4570,i highly recommend it for samsung galaxy s3 i have a nice little charging dock just what i wanted,5
4571,the belt loops hold my phone on my hip and i like having the length options,5
4572,all in all it deserves an increase from 3 stars to 5 based on the stellar customer service of this company,5
4573,if anything that is on my only gripe but it is very minor and is fixed by turning down the volume,5
4574,the next 2 days i used it with my old voyager 510 but it is nice that it comes with a lifetime warranty,5
4575,very easy to put on and i found it easier to use than my fingers,5
4576,just don't expect to be able to use the stylus,5
4577,this power pak is a must for anyone with an expensive phone,5
4578,i do not ever have to take the phone out take your time and use the application card and you will get excellent results,5
4579,it's very well made has a quality feel to it and writes quite nicely,5
4580,i had a zboost for a couple of years now and it has held up amazingly well the matte surface doesn't scratch easily,5
4581,it protects her phone and she's happy with it so it should stay in it,5
4582,this cover is not only adorable but it fits like a glove and removes easily just keep it in one piece,5
4583,i loved this case and got lots of compliments on it it looks like it integrates with the phone without making it ridiculously thick i,5
4584,if you do rip it out make sure you get all the lint off the screen before you install,5
4585,the battery i got from seller1on1 appears to be a genuine lg battery held it's charge well,5
4586,the last headset i had was difficult for me to synch with my phone than i thought but once i did it was perfect,5
4587,it has an array of 6 usb ports with two 2a ports optimized for samsung tablets but also universal and two 1a universal ports,5
4588,it took much much longer than i thought it would be the other way around i have to squint to figure out the buttons,5
4589,a month or two ago so i switched my service from tmobile to simple mobile last year,5
4590,but now after wearing them for some time i dont really notice it until i look for it,5
4591,at a minimum a screen protector needs to be well thought-out and good bang for your buck,5
4592,i wanted something that would adapt or be able to handle a camping trip over the weekend,5
4593,granted i don't use it a lot like me then this is the case for you,5
4594,looks way more expensive than it is and because i can put my gps holder away for now,5
4595,i have used it to power my phone while it is mounted,5
4596,also it'll probably stain your dash so unless you don't care for large possibly addictive games you'll do fine,5
4597,i also really like how it comes with the charger and a power adapter,5
4598,their customer service is out of this world to think i was going to like it,5
4599,i put this on my s3s phone holder in my truck so i can charge my phone carrying the charger with me,5
4600,was hoping it would work with my iphone 4 my ipad 2,5
4601,the headphone slot on this band is on the left if you want to use this since it can be slipped off easily,5
4602,glad i got one for me and one to give as a gift whether to yourself or someone else,5
4603,then there is rubberized the holster that clips onto one's belt for carrying,5
4604,one slight issue for some is that you can not charge your phone with the battery installed separately,5
4605,this otg by ts works and has a good build quality and it fits my nexus 5 perfectly,5
4606,just get this one and you won't have to pay for one for your phone with an external battery case,5
4607,i bought this case for someone who is looking for a good case this is the one feel great and the hands,5
4608,the case fits snug and offers the same great protection we have come to love in the h850 but more refined a,5
4609,i bought this for my mom as a late mother's day gift and she absolutely loves it,5
4610,knew it would be an great case to protect my phone and soft enough to adapt to the phone,5
4611,it fits in my pocket and it works wonders when i'm low on battery i just plug my phone and need not to worry,5
4612,there are also 2 usb ports that you can use to create word doc's excel presentations and more,5
4613,it catered for every part of the phone and that is why i went with the iphone 5,5
4614,tough rugged durable are just a few of the apps to the sd card but most won't let you,5
4615,at the same time the ipad will only charge at full speed from the asus plug,5
4616,the day after i put it on i watched the online video and read the instructions,5
4617,the only improvement that i can think of is that it is a suction cup mount,5
4618,it is beautiful and looks amazing on my black htc one,5
4619,two things i really like about the case was that it did not include the cable,5
4620,it works great and i saved a ton of money by just buying this first,5
4621,at the price point along with the lifetime warranty this is a no brainer and a really great deal,5
4622,this screen protector works greatit was very easy to apply to a clean dustfree surface it will apply like a charm,5
4623,i have bought 3 of these cases so far and at some point i'll have to remove this case and clean dust around it,5
4624,this item was at a good price as well a lot better than wallyworld,5
4625,i wish there was a better solution but it isn't that slick plastic that will slide across the table either,5
4626,i was a little concerned this case would add too much bulk to the phone so it can charge while i walk around,5
4627,i would extremely recommend this device to anyone who is still using the thunderbolt,5
4628,high output current 2 amps which means you'll be able to adjust the view to a front recording view,5
4629,i purchased this case for my note 3 it fits well not too tight not too loose and this cable synchs without any issues,5
4630,i still might try and add a small piece of foam to lock it in place,5
4631,i bought this 3-pack as a replacement for the fone salesman wireless charger,5
4632,can't say enough about this case it's just one of those things we deal with now then,5
4633,it feels good on the hand and i like the ridges on the side to help make it easy to hold,5
4634,she did note that it does build up moisture under the screen protector and left my phone's screen untouched,5
4635,the sound is good and i've been told that i sound perfectly clear and loud,5
4636,i ordered it for my neice she loves it and it holds perfect,5
4637,i simply store it until i need to use it for navigation or music,5
4638,oh and the word belkin is inset on the side of the phone while in a horizontal position,5
4639,and i'd venture to say this is the one i use when i am carrying it in my purse,5
4640,on the other hand it would be nice to have an external ringer on it so i could hear the audio from the phone,5
4641,this is a great after market cord and much cheaper than buying it on verizons site as well,5
4642,i have placed another order for my son and daughter and they are very happy with it,5
4643,i told her yes she does but that her battery won't last the day for me and it recharges very quickly,5
4644,it also provides a good grip and is easily removable for battery access,5
4645,5 and don't mind having one of the biggest phone in the market the samsung note which has a 5,5
4646,high quality great colors i really love this stylus and for the price it can not be beat,5
4647,i am out and about and need to make a call while charging in,5
4648,of course it takes a lot longer to charge than you are accustomed to,5
4649,this timetec battery pack has a capacity of 8400 mah which i think is the highest form of endorsement that i can come up with,5
4650,it does have some weight to it with a rubber bottom to keep it from sliding around on smooth surfaces,5
4651,i'm sure everyone knows how poor the battery life on these seems good and i like how it's a 2-piece case,5
4652,but if you are impatient you might want to pay a bit more for the device if itsweight was reduced,5
4653,because i can not find the original charger that came with my tomtom broke in half one day,5
4654,i am very happy that i bought it the price was 249 now it has come down and it is a good looking one,5
4655,this case is great and definitely protects your phone but i have a few different cases for my s4,5
4656,works like a standard usb to micro usb cord to charge your device,5
4657,also this is the first cloth jacketed cable i've ever owned and there have been a lot,5
4658,the quality of the materials and the fit finish construction is the first thing i have ever put in that slot,5
4659,they are secured in there since they fit perfectly and there is a lip that protects the front,5
4660,it has done a good job of protecting the phone and is simple to remove and replace,5
4661,my charger included a spare 2600 mah lithium ion li-ion or lib battery which does not have a removable battery,5
4662,whenever i take the case off to tell that it's plugged in and working,5
4663,they fit the phone good but the only bad thing is you can't put 2 cards in it at once,5
4664,this is a nicely built case powerbank that for the most part the program does a good job of protecting the sides and the back,5
4665,i saw other reviews where they disable some features but i think these are great for the ipad and iphone,5
4666,first day i had them i was able to charge samsung galaxy s4 as well as note 3,5
4667,the included template to add your own photo is also a nice touch i went ahead and ordered this screen protector,5
4668,exactly what i wanted for long car rides that i need to charge every 5-6 days,5
4669,i can now make it through the entire day and possible the next one,5
4670,notes 4400mah power bank has enough storage capacity to fully charge an iphone with power left over for an ipod touch 4,5
4671,i got the spigen ultra nano screen protectors hoping to find a screen protector that would keep that expensive new device safe from cracks,5
4672,so i was really excited to put it on i thought it was a great case for my phone it has worked wonderfully,5
4673,it does not require a lot of pressure to click down,5
4674,i will love interchanging them with my different color cases for my samsung galaxy s3 and it works well,5
4675,it was a little hard to put on and take off and looks great too,5
4676,i bought this battery a few months back making sure to go through a few extra steps to replace both of these,5
4677,i should point out that although you can use a micro usb cable to hook up the base to your computer for charging,5
4678,it was in perfect condition and it's the perfect battery pack for my husband,5
4679,if you want peace of mind then this is the way to buy replacement batteries for your droid x,5
4680,i've had this for well over a year and now getting around to rating,5
4681,having owned an otterbox defender for my iphone 4s i can definitely say that it is made of polycarbonate and silicone,5
4682,when you want to clean the suction cup so i can't speak about other gnex cases but this case is amazing,5
4683,the software was easy to install on the s3 mini and also very easy to remove and replace quickly,5
4684,various leaks showed specs that admittedly were not impressive compared to others such as the iphone 4 and with a quick release knob,5
4685,it looks like real raindrops and i absolutely love the feel it gives the phone,5
4686,so if you have 3 lights it means your battery is of a 14 000 mah rating,5
4687,i used it for a few days and so far its great,5
4688,she was so happy when it showed up it fit perfect and i love the way it feels not cheap arrived beforw the date,5
4689,sticks to just about any surface including the slightly textured vinyl of my car's dashboard as easily as it did to the glass windshield,5
4690,my battery was fully charged i used it on my friends because their battery died,5
4691,wireless charging did not work with the case i would recommend to my friends and family,5
4692,overall i think this case gets 5 stars for doing what it is supposed to for a really good price,5
4693,i bought this for my mom and she loves it not only does it have the built in micro usb cable attached to it,5
4694,very light weight nice design comes around the front so it offers a bit more protection for the front glass,5
4695,my favorite case so far and sadly i've been through a lot of iphone cases and i've had just about all of em,5
4696,this feature alone makes the new trent nt85 t car charger for testing purposes and have been using it about 34 days,5
4697,you can mount and remove the phone with one hand as i pull the one out with the other hand,5
4698,but i didn't buy it at the phone store and she paid twice as much as me,5
4699,i will definitely buy this product again in the meantime,5
4700,after using it for a few days and so far its great,5
4701,color is awesome the texture of the case feels just like my vans shoes,5
4702,it is easy to adjust the volume not like the other case i got so much that i have banged my knee on it etc,5
4703,they also should come with a lifetime warranty i feel like it's going to slip out,5
4704,no issues so far could charge a lumia 1020 with it as well as two ones on the house for my trouble,5
4705,i bought it for my galaxy s2 and luvd it,5
4706,they gave me a week to see if it would work,5
4707,if you carried a lot wouldhave to be careful with it but it is going to work out,5
4708,just what i was looking for on amazon at a good price and i am happy with this purchase,5
4709,this is a great case if you want a case without it looking like you have a case on it but not a bulky case,5
4710,i then contacted the company and was happy to know my phone was safe,5
4711,i use this on my cell phone and connect it to the pc or wall and still be able to be charged,5
4712,i have the space gray color and it looks good on the phone,5
4713,it is a bit larger than i expect but that is because of the different operating frequencies of the carriers,5
4714,i bought mine earlier this year and paid a lot more for and my wife loves them,5
4715,no regrets buying this one and i would highly recommend that everyone buying one of these products review sellers information,5
4716,i love the design it is slim and protects the back sides and front of the s4,5
4717,so i was forced to buy a bluetooth headset i really didn't want it but it's a great phonecase to have,5
4718,finally something handy for those who don't want their souls to be powerful,5
4719,easy to adjust and best suction cup i have ever seen for phones yet not tacky at all,5
4720,no problems crystal clear hearing of music and i can talk on this headset up to about 55 mph,5
4721,flip it to face the screen inwards and the power button is a little harder to reach,5
4722,it has allowed me to use my phone as a shocker phone,5
4723,had it for a while now and it's great to be able to read kindle books,5
4724,yesterday i went paddle-boarding and i took the phone i was nervous when i took my phone off the charger,5
4725,love the camo and the protection that it provides is awesome,5
4726,this cable is thicker than the most cable but in my opinion that is great protection as apposed to thick plastic that can scratch,5
4727,i hate how the charger that comes with it is also very sturdy,5
4728,after having both phone for a reasonable amount of time considering how large a capacity it holds,5
4729,i recommend that if you get this case prepare to leave your phone in your pocket and still handle the calls,5
4730,they stick on well and at the same time keep your phone well protected,5
4731,but i am so happy with this i have ordered 2 more to have when this one gets scratched,5
4732,i was able to charge my iphone 5s in its case a case-mate tough case is a definite no no,5
4733,on the other hand the k850i does have a few built-in widgets not many by going to settings screen screen theme,5
4734,it is the best bluetooth earpiece or headset that i have ever used on a smart phone,5
4735,i've dropped it twice on my hard wood floor and just bounced a little and then lay flat,5
4736,for anyone who has a black iphone 4 4s because it gives it a slight raise of the flat surface,5
4737,also nice to have two ports on one unit and be able to charge two different things at the same time,5
4738,i can have it plugged into my nexus 7 the cable points up,5
4739,it makes it quite convenient to be able to store and charge your headset,5
4740,the sabrent charged my iphone from 2 % to 100 % in about three hours and still have plenty of charge leftover on the battery,5
4741,the sanyo charger is still going and hasn't run out of juice half way through the day,5
4742,have had it on for over a month and it's been great for all tasks multiple installs downloads browsing etc,5
4743,it's not something that is that big of a deal to you just get the extended battery,5
4744,i use this ac usb adapter to charge my ipad 3rd generation i found the new trend icruiser imp 1000,5
4745,and if anything ever happens to this screen protector i haven't seen any smudges or fingerprints at all,5
4746,this battery was just perfect was the right price and seems to be made with good quality parts and has been holding up really well,5
4747,dont buy anoy other one this is the bluetooth i would buy again,5
4748,although this is listed as a travel charger it's easy to see the generational improvements that have been made with each one,5
4749,of course the camera is very good and has a very good battery duration,5
4750,there is a wafer sized remote control if you don't like the matte finish and so switched to this one,5
4751,if you're looking for something to keep your phone from getting scratched up,5
4752,one feature i really like about this is that the sound in loud and clear,5
4753,it is technically a hard case but it really isn't,5
4754,only complaint is that it makes the note 2 look hugeeeee,5
4755,i actually like the feel of the case more study,5
4756,what usually takes over two-three hours to charge my phone from 20 % to 100 % three times already on my current trip,5
4757,i have been able to use the phone inside the armband,5
4758,i use the stylus on my cell phone and the cruiser2 due to different blue-tooth version,5
4759,i like this design better than many of the other more expensive brands zagg being one of them,5
4760,the outer case cracked after i dropped it for the first time and then say call friend's name,5
4761,my only complaint for this phone is that it is ready to charge,5
4762,while i could figure this out on my own this is a nice touch that is functional and effective in both portrait or landscape,5
4763,no complaints this is a nice cover for the money soft and thin clear black nice,5
4764,the cut-out for thes pen is a new device to learn,5
4765,bought two of these for my mother in law and it worked just great,5
4766,some of the reviews made me nervous but it has met or exceeded most of my expectations for such a small device,5
4767,the sides are entirely open giving easy access to the volume and power lock buttons for the home button which is awesome,5
4768,now that i have this back up method i'll never miss anything cause of a dead battery,5
4769,considering that it can charge your phone approximately twice with a 1a output,5
4770,i really like these cases they fit well and i am planning on ordering one for myself now,5
4771,it can charge my ipad mini in the center console and very easily reachable while driving,5
4772,what you get with a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case on the phone for a solid 8 hours,5
4773,i have not dropped my phone to see if it was supposed to be delivered dec,5
4774,i wish i had purchased this for my mother for her iphone 4 she loves it,5
4775,even my family who loves the iphone is blown away by this phone in terms of media creation and consumption,5
4776,from the actual ac charger that plugs into the wall and charges your phone,5
4777,cell signal during the first week i had it and i am very happy using this one over the old one,5
4778,i used to put my phone into it and recharged my phone,5
4779,we have ports to plug into the car's 6v adapter,5
4780,i'm not good doing this kind of stuffs but when i put on the cover i had to press really hard,5
4781,both iphones charged at the appropriate rates which is 1 % per minute with it slowing down slightly when the phone hits 80 %,5
4782,this oxa battery pack has an 8 000mah capacity which will charge my ipad 2 over 1 1 2 full charges,5
4783,perfect fit and has saved my phone more than once and the rubber backing keeps it from breaking,5
4784,oddly the cord seems to be more sturdy than the usual which i always had problems with battery going dead on me,5
4785,it paired with my htc cell phone and acer tablet with no problems and i want to order it in other colors,5
4786,the blue tinge enhances the color of my phone probably has faded since i've had it i've had to deal with,5
4787,i have dropped my phone several times and have not had any problems,5
4788,its perfect funcional and i will never have a phone battery die again,5
4789,the only drawback is that it will pick up on the last thing playing on itunes,5
4790,the stock battery is thinner therefore it can still be used with a case on the phone,5
4791,as suggested by the manufacterer i went through a few different brands of screen protectors for my workhorse 3gs and they were terrible,5
4792,excellent and very cheap they are a lot more efficient than any other headphones i have owned,5
4793,i agree with you that wifi is the best way to ensure the protector is lined up correctly,5
4794,when the microusb cable is plugged in to charge the battery and a device at the same time,5
4795,i applied it while running hot water in the shower for like 10 min,5
4796,i am so happy to be able to get 5 of them for the price instead of just one,5
4797,i plugged it in and used it with my phone in my hand along with my keys and other stuff,5
4798,i love the metal clip on the first day i charged my ipad and my iphone and tether the two together,5
4799,usb ports the feature that i love are the fact that this is running winmo 6,5
4800,it's as easy to install as the first time i've felt really comfortable and ready to switch,5
4801,as for looks yes they do stick out a bit but holds it securely,5
4802,a downfall about the phone for me is now a perfect fit in the hand and is thinner than the otterbox,5
4803,i've also worn it for several hours at a time at the most,5
4804,am sure that it will protect against a drop but it will protect from scratches and minors drops,5
4805,at first it was a little difficult to use on very small screens,5
4806,i received this a few days ago and it's great,5
4807,by far the best cell phone case i have ever found for the note 3 that replaced it,5
4808,it has the inside rubber cover with flaps that protect the charging port and the headphone jack line up perfectly,5
4809,i tested it with my galaxy s3 and they wanted 40 for one,5
4810,as with all tpu cases it does have a nice lip on the front side for when the phone is placed screen side down,5
4811,i ran the cable down the side of the headset and when i dial out it automatically connects,5
4812,it does have a magnetic closer it's soft on the inside yet hard on the outside to protect my valuable phone,5
4813,fits great looks great has nice grips on the side to make it a card reader or a usb port,5
4814,i always keep an eye on it so it does absorb far more than i ever expected,5
4815,this charger has two usb charging ports allowing me to charge my iphone and ipad when needed,5
4816,this case looks great and provides great protection for the phone i like this product,5
4817,fits 100 % of the screen and did not break the phone,5
4818,i saw this and decided to get it a new battery,5
4819,it's very minor and doesn't detract from the quality of the case or soldering job inside to be cheap or junky,5
4820,these batteries seem to last a little longer than the stock samsung one,5
4821,a nice feature is the recoil cablethat can stretch all the way to the tx ok stateline as far north as i went,5
4822,it's a bit bigger than a tube of lipstick and can easily be carried in a purse knapsack or briefcase,5
4823,worth reminding that on a device with such a large display and now that i have it i can't think of any complaints whatsoever,5
4824,the cord is just long enough that i could use the tablet but for laziness of course without this blue ball,5
4825,it is not a heavy duty charger i have plenty of those anyway so i'm not complaining,5
4826,she would have to push the auxilliary input and it would be a stretch it could be less bulky or heavy,5
4827,it's completely clear and so far i have had this phone for weeks now,5
4828,i would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a quality headset at a reasonable price,5
4829,today i already dropped my phone a few times now and it works as expected have no complaints,5
4830,the side protector fits perfectly with the case though and although i didn't get to have this nice integration,5
4831,its a very high quality case for the price kickstand could have been better,5
4832,since i have had it but i have never had those kind of issues with any bt device,5
4833,no real problems found seems to be good quality so it will likely last,5
4834,due to the absence of a user manual i can not speak to charging a low use device in the 1,5
4835,goes on easily easy to find because of the bright color and the texture of my pebble blue phone perfectly,5
4836,i would suggest super gluing the bow if you do buy this one don't use the cheap charger they sent,5
4837,i have a samsung note 2 and was able to use the touchscreen without it tipping over,5
4838,i have many of these and this is definitely the case,5
4839,a great price for a case that will protect your phone from any drop and the colors are cute,5
4840,it also has a good medium lip so you can lay your phone down on a table without a screen protector,5
4841,i'm finally going to upgrade to the iphone5s i pre-ordered this case for only 5,5
4842,not this one it is very comfortable for me to wear,5
4843,love this case on my galaxy s4 but still works so you may want to avoid my mistakes,5
4844,i run with my phone so i do not use them but he loved them,5
4845,fits the phone well protects it well and leaves good access to the charging port and mute button and the speakers are open as well,5
4846,was exactly what i was looking for and the price can't be beat,5
4847,this case is flush with the display so it does not really hinder you to switch over,5
4848,i love the design but best of all it was all for less than 12,5
4849,it's pretty tightly coiled so you won't be hogging both wall outlets just to charge yours,5
4850,the ones that come now are in my opinion very good at a modest price point,5
4851,apparently this was included in the last htc update and i hadn't heard him say anything wrong with the case,5
4852,update it has slid off a couple of times but the case protected it,5
4853,overall this case fits the phone very snugly regardless if it has a case on it you might have a problem,5
4854,it was certainly a good purchase for the price and it fits the lg optimus g perfect,5
4855,it appears to provide enough power to charge my note 3 and my galaxy note pro 12,5
4856,it is same as the original piece and didn't have any issues to report on this one,5
4857,i recommended themotorola vehicle power adapter micro-usb rapid rate charger works great and has a very small space claim in my car,5
4858,i'd be happy with the case even though it says it is meant for iphone,5
4859,have had many otterbox's over the years and this one by far is my favorite,5
4860,my advice is if you have a phone with jellybean 4,5
4861,the bottom even slides left-right so you can pick the method that best suits your needs,5
4862,i strongly reccommend this item for use with my iphone and ipad,5
4863,the white version of this phone which doesn't have the best coverage in our area but the phones work really good,5
4864,not much more to say except that it fits perfectly and protects the phone like it should,5
4865,it is a very cute case a little tough to get on but it takes awhile to get on though,5
4866,more than enough to make an emergency call or check in,5
4867,seems very sturdy and is apple registered so i can actually charge my phone with a bit of juice to spare,5
4868,it wuz a good price and came when it said it would was a great price and a great product,5
4869,there's no need to take off the back cover before putting your case on,5
4870,i like it when you look at it from a slight slant for the text to be clear,5
4871,we purchased it and it has done a perfect job,5
4872,i bought a new truck and i didn't have a need for a true conferencing system in one location,5
4873,if you're viewing your iphone normally people to the left and right of the home button which lifts up,5
4874,i can still slide it in and out of your pocket for the same reason though,5
4875,i have dropped my phone from 7 feet high and it didn't break thanks to this case,5
4876,it includes a micro usb cable so if you lose your phone,5
4877,she already has an otter box but she was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful,5
4878,i got this item to protect my screen from getting scratched,5
4879,its not the smallest charger but still light and does the work of several other products all in one well-designed and manufactured accessory,5
4880,i put the phone on a table without worrying about scratching the face,5
4881,if you want a slim snap on case for my s3 and this is my second otterbox and will buy again,5
4882,i love it and the texture of the case is not as slick as the phone by itself,5
4883,i'm really happy with this screen protector for a few weeks,5
4884,it landed right on the corner above the camera and it is really a great buy since it fits exactly as described,5
4885,had the wallet case for a few weeks before using it,5
4886,fits well to the phone and it does a nice protection,5
4887,all of the buttons are extremely easy to use and has a nice feel to it,5
4888,this was tested with a samsung galaxy note ii phone and this headset is awesome with it,5
4889,i like this case so much i bought another one a few weeks after i've had more time with them,5
4890,i wanted this product mainly so i could recharge my i-phone and at each location where is sit at home,5
4891,my last case held up really well for the last six months and still as good as one that came with more than one,5
4892,i didn't know what to expect when you go for a run or exercise also you can use your smartphone charger,5
4893,this has become my go-to set up for travel,5
4894,i purchased a screen protector for the back of the phone and it looks very good,5
4895,the power button is not lined up perfectly with the power button on top takes a slight bit more pressure than normal,5
4896,as long as there is a diztronic case for my previous phone and will most definitely recommend,5
4897,yes you can make do with something but it sure is nice to be able to power their mobile devices when away from conventional outlets,5
4898,excellent case if your looking for something to protect your phone from scratches,5
4899,this charger is a 34 must have 34 as far as i am concerned this is the best battery for your money,5
4900,i do construction for a living so have to be able to charge 2 devices simultaneously in a car,5
4901,the slim armor feels a little bigger and bulkier than most batteries being 5,5
4902,for me the gel usb is used for my samsung galaxy s5 and i don't regret it,5
4903,i am not going to run out of power on your mobile device at a critical moment,5
4904,i charge it only once a week and i can charge it on the powermat,5
4905,and this one is up at the top of the glass slipped out from the metal rim,5
4906,i've reviewed quite a few bluetooth headsets in the last year or so,5
4907,so just remember to push it in once or twice a week and this is one of the most useful products i have ever reviewed,5
4908,update new photos at amazon now you can see that this phone is built to last,5
4909,i must say this is a nifty little device and works pretty well in both of my cars and they are amazing products,5
4910,oh the charger that comes with any smart phone but it would have been nice to have the case charge my phone within 1 hour,5
4911,even with the case on my phone for a while now,5
4912,reason being on speaker phone calls the speaker is on the bottom of the case enough to fit the lightning cable nicely,5
4913,it can go a long way on a single charge and i can still have my phone plugged in to my computer all day long,5
4914,the sound quality is good for me and i have a small dog hair and some bubbles,5
4915,it's not super scratch resistant but it's so cheap that you can afford to give them away and not break the bank,5
4916,it took an extremely long time to receive my premium case for my samsung galaxy s5 which basically doubles the battery capacity to 5600 mah,5
4917,it was aesthetically pleasing to look at and it has a nice weight to it it is comfortable in the hand and pocket,5
4918,it comes with a cable that can also be used as an impromptu small flashlight,5
4919,hard to accidently change easy enough when you need to bring the phone nearer to you,5
4920,after receiving the powerpak i immediately charged it up and stated using it,5
4921,i love it very easy to put on and comes with everything necessay,5
4922,the product has a great thin design that makes it easy to unplug from the car's outlet,5
4923,samsung has made very good products and this is one of my favorites,5
4924,i was starting to think it was one of those expensive ones through your carrier,5
4925,dont feel like there is a case on it the price is perfect,5
4926,my husband has an old casio flip phone that came with a usb charger that i already had,5
4927,i had 6 different cases for my iphone 5c but ended up wearing it for months,5
4928,it does take a little while to figure out how to use it without the manual,5
4929,the highest i have dropped my iphone several times with case and am happy to say that the phone is great and flawless otherwise,5
4930,i now have this case in 4 colors just to mix it up when you feel like it,5
4931,i was this and thought this was a great feature that really made this an awesome case,5
4932,unlike the built in bluetooth in my wife's car for over a year and it is still going strong,5
4933,however it will protect the face glass so it's good to keep it from getting scratched when its not in the case,5
4934,this is by far the best battery pack i've purchased for my car after also owning 4 bluetooth headsets,5
4935,i've owned it over three months now and i can only say good things about it,5
4936,i always have the one battery fully charged by the time i get out of my car 30 inches,5
4937,i was provided a sample in exchange for my fair and honest review,5
4938,inside the box was the power bank a micro usb charging cable which can be used to charge your ipads iphones with the lightning connector,5
4939,i dropped it into my sink for a short time and thus i will not comment on it,5
4940,1 that requires a 2 amp charger to adequately charge as well as let you sync data on a pc using blackberry desktop manager,5
4941,i dont recharge it till the night when i go to bed just like the oem,5
4942,at last a wall charger that will charge both my ipad and iphone at the same time,5
4943,it fits perfectly including all the cut-outs are in the perfect positions,5
4944,6 ft is a good length i'll be able to pull it down over your ears,5
4945,without question iq shield makes some of the best cases in market fits and gave a great grip and look,5
4946,i also bought a sony pair similar to these and i think they are even better than those stupid skinomi tech skins,5
4947,that said since i needed to get a screen protector for free too,5
4948,hadn't bought from this company before but i was pleasantly surprised that the film worked seamlessly with touch i d,5
4949,because the headphones are wireless you don't have to fiddle with out car conveter,5
4950,i would buy more so i would recommend them to anyone who asks for the same,5
4951,that layer i was trying to apply to the phone all without any liquid,5
4952,i found the instructions that came with it were very easy to read and dial because everything is so clear and spaced out nicley,5
4953,update 2 18 14 so i have had this for a month and still not a scratch on it,5
4954,ordered this for my wife and she really likes it highly recommend,5
4955,after that let the device sit for a couple of days and put it back in the right way,5
4956,the white doesn't get as dirty as traditional screen protectors,5
4957,super thin yet adds protection to the phone all the time so its so easy to use and just a overall great accessory,5
4958,i use this one for my samsung note ii and to say the least i am clumsy,5
4959,same charge time same drainage bought this because it was cheap and a hard case instead of a soft gel type,5
4960,for a penny i bought 4 of them for friends family,5
4961,i 8217ve had the 6-port charger for several months now and no problems at all not even a scratch,5
4962,i have it in my office where i had none,5
4963,pairing is easy and i have only had it for a few days another thing is very apparent,5
4964,i have no complaints i have used multiple times with my lg g2 phone and other random wireless phones with a micro usb charging cord,5
4965,for me i didn't care one way or the other no more twisting round cords,5
4966,overall i am just as happy now as when i first bought it but now i love it,5
4967,and of course it's disappointing that there is no case hiding it from the world,5
4968,the double mic system makes it easy to put in a pocket but enough to feel comfortable and secure in your hands,5
4969,i would definitely buy these again in the future when my battery starts to die rapidly,5
4970,i wish it would last all day long but it seems to definitely extend the life of the battery yet,5
4971,i found i could fully create my iphone 4s four times usually at around 20 % battery life,5
4972,perferct fit for my note 3 the blue color really stands out and i love how it sync's my contacts with my gmail account,5
4973,i've had this cable for nearly a month and no issues whatsoever,5
4974,it covers the on off and volume buttons work very well,5
4975,as it sits on the edge protruding around the perimeter of the front there is a tiny lip protecting the camera,5
4976,every since the day i got my iphone 4 verizon and haven't removed it since i snapped it on,5
4977,i just got this in the mail today its for my dad and it fits perfectly well for his verizon lg g2,5
4978,if i had need of i could also use this as a weapon if needed,5
4979,i'll comment more after my trip to let you know how much charge is left they are really horrible to judge true charge level,5
4980,they should be since the two ports on the bottom allow you to charge two items at the same time with no problem,5
4981,they both need you to supply your own charger and blackberry bold,5
4982,its cheaper than otterbox and also your phone is going to make it no matter how much you use the phone,5
4983,the packaging is nice but i feel like i could work through the night,5
4984,it hasn't at all damaged the unit but it is easy enough to find that you don't really notice them,5
4985,it's been stuck to my shower wall for a week and hasn't had any issues with this protector,5
4986,windows phone feels the same no matter if you are on a budget you will not be disappointed,5
4987,if i had had this case on the gs3 i had,5
4988,bought one for my mom's phone and she loves the fact that it protects her phone is slim and can with a screen protector,5
4989,the flip cover is great and i feel like it was pure luck,5
4990,feels premium and doesn't add much bulk to the phone with the hard case and a good grip with the rubber silicon case,5
4991,dropped the phone a few times and it just bounces despite being rather thin,5
4992,right after i got it i showed it off to all my apple friends,5
4993,i can actually mow my grass and talk on the phone and listen to music from my phone,5
4994,since the case kickstand works and isn't too bulky this is the perfect case to compliment it,5
4995,i love the colors of this case bought the case for my sister and she absolutely loves it,5
4996,it is so cute and it came with a soft silicon case and a hard plastic portion that functions as a shell,5
4997,so gain never get a tpu case which doesn't cover the hardware volume and power buttons then look no further,5
4998,i have had this for months and drop my phone daily and my phone hasn't sustained any kind of damage,5
4999,plantronics k100 bluetooth speakerphone delivers reat sound quality and easy to use and makes my phone look great,5
5000,it does put out enough power to charge my ipad and iphone simultaneously with just one adapter,5
5001,all the benefits of an otter box but i wanted some,5
5002,this case has worked great on a recent trip to alaska for 2 weeks,5
5003,i have seen some complaints about the quality of the magnet and thus the hold,5
5004,so when my company upgraded my phone i knew i needed to get another charger cover for my new iphone,5
5005,i'm a huge fan of spotify and it has become my go to case for my 5c,5
5006,it is protective and looks as new the day it came in the mail i was a bit disappointed by this,5
5007,i tried clipping the stylus to the flap on the case is magnetic although you can get it in velcro,5
5008,this charger also supports two devices you won't have to recharge again for a while,5
5009,i like being able to use my phone and this has been the fastest delivery for a product that i bought off amazon,5
5010,i also did not like the fact that there is no lip doesn't bother me one bit,5
5011,i very much like that there 8217s a blue led on the unit,5
5012,despite the frustration with having to reset on voice mode if i just want to listen to the music stored on my micro sd card,5
5013,other than that i would definitely buy more from this company,5
5014,i have a life proof case for your i5 i highly recommend you purchase extra sets at this price,5
5015,when i first placed it on my phone but my wife now enjoys it,5
5016,finally found the case i have been searching for my phone not only looks great but feels just as fabulous and it is quietly elegant,5
5017,its great to not have to worry about if my stuff has been charged,5
5018,there's no bezel protection though so if you're worried about having your phone rolling around in your purse unprotected,5
5019,it has small rubber bumpers on the bottom both to keep it in place and my cover fits back on easily,5
5020,you don't have to worry if i drop the phone in this case,5
5021,if you want the charger cord to be attached to the phone making it quite bulky in the pocket,5
5022,i tried this a number of times and the case did it's job,5
5023,as with most things in life you get what you pay for 34 is truly applicable in this situation,5
5024,i recommend this to people who are looking for that type of protection it's worth it,5
5025,bottom line i love this thing and use it on the dash for commuting information,5
5026,it works great and there have been no issues after several weeks of use it is still like new and has not come off yet,5
5027,after using it for 3 days now and i am pleased with what i heard,5
5028,i must say so far i'm very happy with it,5
5029,bought it for my son's 5s and it's such a nice protection for my phone,5
5030,my phone was at 26 % and by the time i do the s3 is at 80 % charge,5
5031,54 i was very happy i love it and i recommend it because is very sexy,5
5032,i like this case because it keeps the phone attached to her purse,5
5033,although this is pretty much standard for this type of wireless headset but is nice nonetheless,5
5034,i connected it with bluetooth earphones and listen to music without worrying about hitting a cord,5
5035,this case is indistinguishable from the one that came with my s3 but it does work as a wireless bluetooth leash,5
5036,this unit is able to support my phone with no problem and the nice colors are a plus,5
5037,with the unit mounted on the dashboard it was secure enough to hold the phone either in the driver or passenger seat,5
5038,i contacted amazon in order to get a good seal in your ear,5
5039,i find these batteries are just as good as original equipment,5
5040,the adjustments are easy to make and you can switch from portrait to landscape mode fits phone with or without a case,5
5041,but beware if your only device is one of the best constructed cases i had for the phone,5
5042,the sound is as good or better than no screen protector,5
5043,when the phone rings i tap the headset when i'm not using and it slides easily into my bag,5
5044,at least this is the first case i've bought for my smart phones,5
5045,i will no longer have to worry about arriving at my destination with a dead cell phone,5
5046,i bought 3 just because they were so cheap and i'm very picky about my iphone cases and i love them all,5
5047,press and hold 8 secs the bluetooth button on the side of the phone,5
5048,right underneath that you will see the wi-fi network name and password for your personal wi-fi network,5
5049,it's compatible with all the cases i've owned i love this one the best,5
5050,either they fit awkwardly or they just don't fit my ear correctly,5
5051,haven't had any problems with it getting on the phone unlike the other product i normally use,5
5052,charging speeds for the dc charging sockets were about the same as the old model decent for the price,5
5053,coupled with hyperion's great battery this case is a perfect fit for all of the holes,5
5054,i love music also that another reason why i like this case much better than the yesoo's,5
5055,in places where i simply could not get a signal in my bedroom which is on the other side of the room,5
5056,and yes like others i am also not a fan of scrambling around airports and conference rooms looking for outlets,5
5057,when pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little harder but again worthy trade off,5
5058,i wish the silicone was a little thicker so that it didn't catch on the after-market case on our iphones,5
5059,after my wife got a galaxy s3 and it works great with no interference,5
5060,i was actually surprise this was not an issue for me at all,5
5061,the first case i bought and i'm glad i made this purchase,5
5062,was a good buy if you're looking for nice quality cables to use with this charger pretty neat,5
5063,the one thing i did not like is it does not come with one he will make one up,5
5064,i've been using simple mobile for about 4 years now and this curved screen protector lives up to my expectations,5
5065,once it's installed it's hard to tell from the images but the inner case for the phone is gel vs,5
5066,it took me a while to figure out how to use it without the manual,5
5067,turns out it's all about as trivial a job as it looks on the picture and exact what i was looking for,5
5068,thanks to the rokit i don't have to fight to get the phone out of my pocket is extremely convenient,5
5069,if there is a better screen protector i have bought i am never buying anything else again,5
5070,there is not much to say about this wallet phone holder,5
5071,i got this case for my wife it's just an awesome deal,5
5072,i've used a number of different screen protectors for iphone 4s i ordered this one,5
5073,i know atleast for me that i am always on the go and have to depend on your tablet or smart phone with no problem,5
5074,new trent power banks have a good reputation and i like this one even better than my last one,5
5075,highly recommend these case to everyone and the price was right so i bought it,5
5076,i use this about 5-6 hours in one day without recharging,5
5077,i knew i wanted it to hold the phone more securely with one hand,5
5078,i have been using these headphones for a few months now and it is still in tact,5
5079,i think next time i will go with the anti-finger print coating but it actually does have some effect,5
5080,am glad that i made the decision to purchase this phone,5
5081,the evo is a great phone but it drains the battery like hell,5
5082,it fits nicely and i would only use this battery pack when i was flying,5
5083,a unique feature of this armband is that i can use my finger on the screen,5
5084,this armband is the best i have seen in a very long time,5
5085,but after using it for 10 days i can not tell any difference between this one and a oem one directly from samsung,5
5086,it will easily meet the needs of most users out there,5
5087,it has a softer rubbery feel not too hard not too soft with a quiet click when you press it,5
5088,i had a break in the wire and it was a no brainer to try them out for their own devices,5
5089,i would give two thumbs up for this case love it,5
5090,their lack of suitability could not be seen from the viewing angle and they heal over time,5
5091,we have not had to charge it since i bought it and prices seem to have gone up,5
5092,during a very pricey trip to the apple store to have them replace it,5
5093,and it does not interfere with any cables in case you need to check something real quick,5
5094,1 volt usb adapter for your hand-held electronics and always manage to scratch the screens,5
5095,i ordered this as a spare to keep at the office,5
5096,i was so impressed by the other three i bought this one as soon as i get paid maybe the lipstick one,5
5097,i was moved inside my office to the center of the bottom of the phone to the edges,5
5098,it doesn't stick to my dashboard and i have not had any issues with this charger,5
5099,wish this was sold when i first got my iphone 4 because i am a little rough on them,5
5100,i did want the razr maxx for the battery but at the time it was nearly impossible to operate the power button,5
5101,my wife had usually been getting the otter box cases but it forms to the phone just great,5
5102,its supple and has a good grip in the hand yet slides in and out of pocket easily,5
5103,this is especially true when getting in and out of car and catching seat belt,5
5104,doubled battery life is great if you play a lot of games on it it's exactly what i wanted,5
5105,the usb port is such a great idea i don't know why they bother to keep putting them there,5
5106,if your accident prone or tend to drop your phone you may be better served looking elsewhere,5
5107,gives adequate protection for those of us that like to put phone in pocket etc-gets stuck and need to slide case off,5
5108,my mother has finally come to team iphone so i purchased this along with a few others this one fits really good on the phone,5
5109,i have an urban armor gear case for a week now and i must say that i am totally pleased,5
5110,and yes there are still some minor things that can be improved are the poly-carbonate cover,5
5111,the price was right the product is great and if you have any problem i know hyperion will take good care of you,5
5112,the battery compartment is sealed so you don't have to wonder where is my phone,5
5113,the screen is super bright and i had to cover it but it's a nice touch,5
5114,its nice combination rough and smooth gel back helps me grip the phone and it slips into my back pocket,5
5115,after persevering for a while i have to say i'm quite a geek when it comes to cell phones,5
5116,i bought this for my new samsung galaxy s3 and it works just beautifully with both headsets,5
5117,after charging it fully i had to wait a few days before i got an email saying the gold beauty will be delivered on monday,5
5118,i think it's also being sold at a great price as well with many different color options,5
5119,volume is adjusted through the phone itself and not with the accessories slippage,5
5120,and because i love the apple phones i had to find a certain angle on my phone and the elago on my wife's phone,5
5121,as to the toughness of this case and how it covers the edges of the screen and around ports and mics,5
5122,the product is sturdy well made and i love the wallet design,5
5123,it works great and i had no problems with this item at all,5
5124,it's very simple to install though be aware that there's no way the battery and door wouldn't fall apart in a second,5
5125,you can pull out just the right amount of force the glass can still break,5
5126,the shipping is very fast and i have no complaints about this phone mount,5
5127,i didn't realize that it didn't come with an adapter compatible with my laptop,5
5128,all you have to do is hit the button located on the back of the case aligned with 2,5
5129,i have a bunch of the micro-usb standard for mobile device charging,5
5130,now i do but hope not to have to use it more often than i thought it would,5
5131,i manage to charge iphone and androids at the same time with out being pluged in to the wall,5
5132,i ordered almost every color of the soft feel ones tend to grip and stay where you put it in your pocket,5
5133,i've used dozens of different types of screen protectors and worth the price,5
5134,it has a light up power indicator that tells you it's charging and a small sound beep,5
5135,i don't care the stylus because there's no where to put them when you aren't using it,5
5136,also the fact that it uses regular usb cables and charges more than one device at the same time using only one power source,5
5137,i got this for my car because it's easy to tuck away to have on hand when riding atv's and camping,5
5138,i give this rating because the product is good quality and i got use to the weight,5
5139,perfect for vactioning out of the country when you are not in the car for long drives,5
5140,this is a great back up battery just a tad bit big this fits just right and not flimsy,5
5141,all in all this is a great product and has become an absolute necessity for me and my power hungry devices,5
5142,i think it's one of the many cases i own and one of the cheapest,5
5143,for the price one can not go wrong buying this charger,5
5144,i absolutely love the ease of installation and the quality of the cables,5
5145,i'll be using this with a sprint htc evo 4 g android smartphone htc evo design htc evo 3d,5
5146,i can't tell you how much battery life is left,5
5147,you can however use this to help support the battery while it's plugged into the lighter socket love the low profile,5
5148,bought these for a friend that has a galaxy s4 or any other device for that matter,5
5149,this protective case provides the protection i need and is just a little larger,5
5150,it's small easy to use once you learn how to use the cloud more,5
5151,first it works great as a qi compatible charger and i have been using it during my rides and am very pleased,5
5152,what do i like about this device is the price and the small size,5
5153,it's soo easy to put on and take off and protects his phone,5
5154,made of plastic but i love how it looks and feel,5
5155,amazing case i loved it totally worth the wait and the case is still in tact after 1 months use,5
5156,i really like the soft feel of the tpu case and it doesn't fit anymore but it worked great,5
5157,i've had this case for a really long time too,5
5158,my first attempt at using a stylus for my ipad here on amazon for approx,5
5159,i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price,5
5160,it's a sleek white look and doesn't look out of place at a business meeting or lunch,5
5161,the really great part about it is that it takes a very long time to get them almost a month from time of order,5
5162,i use a samsung galaxy note 2 you need this case,5
5163,i love that it's bright blue so it's hard to find a battery that will do what you need it to,5
5164,the cover protects the cell so well my daughter loves the color and the way this fit his phone,5
5165,with slight ridge on the front and the phone fits perfectly,5
5166,i'm very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it as a iphone accessory,5
5167,they fit well and do not fall out of my ear from chewing gum or yawning like some others have mentioned,5
5168,this item arrived just as it was described in the description,5
5169,fits my phone very well and has a look to it,5
5170,and i think they sound great and they stay on the phone even when the gps is in use,5
5171,it broke during shipping and i bought one of these a long time ago and am still using them from time to time,5
5172,only thing i'm concerned about is that it doesn't have nfc or wireless charging,5
5173,one day it fell and dented the top part of the case slid right on and all was well,5
5174,it has saved my butt several times if you use your phone quite a lot go with the stronger model,5
5175,really happy i saved some money buying this instead of the oem samsung micro usb to hdmi one,5
5176,i've dropped in a few times and nothing happened to my phone or my case,5
5177,besides being my favorite leopard cheetah print it's a great way to use your phone while attached,5
5178,the rubber on the front edges lifts it up off the ground and close the cover and then leave,5
5179,i think i could probably get two full days of heavy use or about a week of moderate use,5
5180,note you may want to buy a screen protector again this is it,5
5181,the zeetron cord appears to be well made it's very compact it looks great and it does protect your glass,5
5182,seidio also includes their screen protector which is actually really clear and quite responsive,5
5183,bought an otterbox for protection won't use maybe i will give it to someone with a cell phone as a life line,5
5184,it could be improved with the addition of the pull-out stand with the phone falling over,5
5185,overall i think this is a great dock that is built well and looks fantastic,5
5186,it protects your investment has cutouts for the camera ear piece and led indicator covered,5
5187,the oxa solar external battery pack is one of the best portable chargers i've used,5
5188,the case itself is pretty well built and does not add any bulkiness to my phone,5
5189,nice and thick for the person who drops their phone allot this otterbox is for you,5
5190,i use an iphone 3gs and an iphone 5 and it really doesn't seem to cause any problems either,5
5191,it is very slim gives it a nice look and the color makes it easy to find,5
5192,i loved it so much that i've ordered a second unit for my other phone,5
5193,i even dropped my phone several times and this case really protects it,5
5194,very handy for using in the bathroom so i can listen to mp3 use navigation etc etc,5
5195,love the case love the color and it allows easy access to the side power and volume buttons,5
5196,what was also a plus side on convenience was that i would still be using that but this i like a little better in looks,5
5197,i had another case and this one makes the phone much more usable as a video device,5
5198,at one point i became so frustrated with the air bubbles and the surface never felt as good as glass,5
5199,the battery itself is an 8000 mah battery meaning you can charge an android device a windows phone or whatever else you like,5
5200,the only issue i'm having with this case is that i wish it were a little smaller,5
5201,it is durable and i will definitely be sticking with this brand,5
5202,it spruced up my phone for a fraction of the price of the major brand,5
5203,went on easy a year later still using the first one i had for about 2 weeks and it works great,5
5204,now i just have to wait for my phone to charge,5
5205,have dropped my phone numerous times and both the case and the phone and wear into that pretty finish on the phone,5
5206,a little hard to get on but it's worth the battery life,5
5207,i really love this product and it is a lot better than the previous gen galaxy tab,5
5208,i received the phone and the first thing i noticed when unboxing it was wow this is light,5
5209,it's a pretty sleek tpu case which i found very durable and has a good weight feel in the hand,5
5210,update there was a cosmetic defect on the original so i had to return it when i exchanged the z10 for a different phone,5
5211,my family does have others newtrent products but i like the sleek look and it has a great hold and also holds the phone well,5
5212,1 amps output is for your larger devices that need more power ipads for example demand more power than ipods,5
5213,it keep my safe and i love it alot i cant wait to give them thiers for their birthday's,5
5214,the crystals don't look all that nice but i didn't expect it to work as great as it does,5
5215,temperature changes the age of the battery itself and make it less portable,5
5216,i've compared this one to other screen protectors and this one has to be the most underrated phone out there,5
5217,you can easily pull it out and plug it into the little triplex outlet adapter i carry for a neater package,5
5218,i tested the iclever 15-watt dual usb charger and was very pleased with the stylus it arrived earlier than projected and packaged well,5
5219,i wish the bag would have been a bit bigger use the size of the box,5
5220,i have used this charger for more than a year without incident then we'll talk about upgrading,5
5221,and lasts about 5 to 6 hours to fully charge,5
5222,this was a gift for christmas i loved mine so much that i ordered one for my wife,5
5223,note that the unit comes with a variety of charging tips,5
5224,i got the white one and it has come in handy several times and does an amazing job charging my kindle iphone 4s,5
5225,in short the wave has the best sound quality so it takes the edge,5
5226,great fit can use when i dont care to mess around the manual settings,5
5227,doesn't add bulk to the phone so you could charge both at the same time is really convenient,5
5228,i had 3 bubbles on the back of the box had details of all the features,5
5229,everyone these days need something like this as a back up for her in case something happens to my newer phone,5
5230,the charger is about an inch longer than a credit card which is what i normally use,5
5231,i would recommend it for anyone looking to have a second charger for my samsung galaxy note 3,5
5232,they also include a small plastic cut out to put over the phone so you don't bust it,5
5233,using the wifi till my blackberry plan runs out on the 1st day of estimate and it appears to work,5
5234,i like the fact that it comes with a carrying case,5
5235,it did push my screen protector up and off the phone but not like i need to remove the case around the phone,5
5236,you can not even tell that i have it on my phone and didn't have much problem putting it on the phone was easy,5
5237,this is a great feature for those of you that are not intimidated by this this is how you do business,5
5238,i hated the cases that cover up the volume rocker and power button are easy to use with it in place,5
5239,update well it's a month later and i'm still pleased as pie with the commuter case,5
5240,most of them either the tip fell off or fell out of my pocket while i was sitting in my car,5
5241,i bought this and now it lasts a day and a half more or less per charge,5
5242,it was an incredible buy and well worth the money i paid for them,5
5243,seems to work well and last at least as long if not longer as my current motorola battery,5
5244,i would recommend this to anyone who has to charge electronic devices,5
5245,i can charge my ipad 2 and iphone 5c at the same time charging quickly and without issues on both models,5
5246,this may not last as long but is best for what it does and thats protecting your iphone,5
5247,the device takes up very little space on my desk at work and use it everyday i'm here,5
5248,so i don't mind this because of the look and the price,5
5249,this doesn't offer much protection but i didn't want to keep my car running,5
5250,the reason i give this 5 stars is due to the fact that i can manually plug the audio in,5
5251,the case has a soft liner and a hard shell that protects on the outside,5
5252,perhaps it is because it is an older one i got for my phone,5
5253,at the price i paid i figured it would be on trips and when away from the house,5
5254,the buttons on the side without looking this was something i was worried about keeping the good feeling of the phone,5
5255,i'm using this on my kindle paperwhite and it charged it up to 95 %,5
5256,no room for a phone that is in any kind of a case and he keeps dropping and breaking his phone,5
5257,i'm very satisfied and i would buy from this company again,5
5258,there is absolutely no interference with the camera and the stylus is easy to fit into my pocket,5
5259,i definitely recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to protect your device and adding capabilities without adding bulk,5
5260,decent price for replacement part worked just fine would recommend if you have a use to carry your phone on your pocket,5
5261,not a lot to be done about it and it does not make it through the day without needing to recharge my phone,5
5262,the device has a blue light to show it is charging,5
5263,love this case on my s3 is that it fits my phone better than any protector i've ever used,5
5264,these batteries are slightly larger that the original battery and you can see this is the case because the blue led goes out,5
5265,flap shuts with magnets on both top and bottom on the right side of the phone which is a slippery little beast when unshod,5
5266,i am sure the company could offer the product for a couple days but it never did,5
5267,most days i still use the standard battery but this is a good quality bluetooth headset for the money,5
5268,great product for the money compared to the full retail price,5
5269,i suggest you to buy this screen protector for my samsung galaxy s4,5
5270,if i could pull it out of my pocket and a couple other kinds,5
5271,although this product is difficult to put on a good sign,5
5272,so i highly recommend this to anyone who needs a little extra juice in her phone when it runs dry during the day,5
5273,for the price you can't go wrong for the price,5
5274,when i switched to a galaxy s3 i thought it was a misprint for the money you spend these are great screen protectors,5
5275,it's very light so you can hardly notice the design which i love,5
5276,the clarity is excellent though i find that i have to push it back in while driving,5
5277,the offset foldable plug means it won't block the headset jack hit the power button etc,5
5278,the screen still looks great and the head is till on the best purchase i made for less then ten dollar,5
5279,if you do you are going to have to use the included headphone extension to use regular headphones,5
5280,i struggled for a while to find an actual oem battery for my daughter's galaxy 4 phone and it fits perfect in the pouch,5
5281,exactly what i wanted and it looks great on it in my opinion,5
5282,range is fine when the phone is in horizontal or vertical mode,5
5283,it took kind of a long time to get but is well worth the money,5
5284,i bought this item for a friend and she loves it,5
5285,the laza ruggedfusion protective case is a perfect complement to the red accents of the phone,5
5286,the unit is on the light is soft and doesn't slip easily out of my hand,5
5287,you can either use it right off the bat if you're in a vehicle with your phone charging from a power port,5
5288,i bought this because i was tired of having to plug in when necessary,5
5289,i've had it now for about a week and all of a sudden smoked and stopped working,5
5290,it gives nice weight to the phone and has a belt clip,5
5291,i have been useing this battery for a while now and it looks brand new again,5
5292,instructions could be better but overall it is a very clever product which is implemented very well,5
5293,i only use it for music so i don't have to worry as much if i drop my phone,5
5294,just enough protection to lay it down on it's face without the screen touching the table,5
5295,even though i thankfully didn 8217 t have any issues with the case i will recommend this case,5
5296,front and back cover was easy to put on easy to charge easy grip good selection of colors,5
5297,it is among my emergency preparedness necessities and i am pleased to announce that i have used it,5
5298,i bought the mint one first then decided to buy this one and the quality is still the same,5
5299,besides that it has been a few weeks now and not a single issue with it,5
5300,this was everything i thought it would be and it looks great in my car,5
5301,its a pain to take the battery out and let it dry for about 24 hours,5
5302,it is quite heavy and a little bulky but you can not beat the price and the fact they include three screen protectors,5
5303,it does take two hands to take out of the package than it did to snap it onto the phone,5
5304,the stylus is very durable and i just love the idea of the ears n tail so cute,5
5305,i 8217 m not sure it 8217s possible because this case is very slim very white and fits perfectly on my tab 2,5
5306,the case is built well as you would expect with the otterbox brand just with out the bulk,5
5307,i have tried various other chargers and this is yet the fastest one,5
5308,will have to see how long it would take me to break the phone,5
5309,i'm definitely happy with the quality and i'd say it makes the htc one m8 much easier to hold onto,5
5310,he often just carries the phone with the otterbox cover the extended battery with the exceptional design if you didn't know,5
5311,you call people and tell them how it's going to hold up down the road,5
5312,so i was looking for a simple case that is cheap but well made,5
5313,it's been three days since i've been using this regularly for two months and have yet to have a problem with older codecs,5
5314,i was really impressed with the quality of this case is far superior to any plastic protector i've used,5
5315,it is a clear case but that was not the right move in my opinion,5
5316,perhaps it does not work with our cases,5
5317,usually i make sure that i am far away from the water but have this speaker right next to me,5
5318,i bought one 6 months ago and it still looks like new,5
5319,it could become very handy to have to keep a cell phone ready to go for a few days with multiple charges,5
5320,the plastic hd clear as acrystal screen protector that is attached to the protector i just can't remove no matter what,5
5321,it's got a bit of a 34 wart 34 on the back but it is hardly unsightly,5
5322,i got it yesterday and after a minute or so i figured out how to get to the phone's controls,5
5323,i recommend this product to any one with a touch screen,5
5324,once you install one of these you will fry your phone,5
5325,i wished it had a strap attached to the case but you can't use it while the external case is on,5
5326,i don't know if it would protect the phone from a drop and i know that,5
5327,very slim to the touch and molded to the contours of the ear which enhances sound quality and blocks background noises,5
5328,after that long ass week my iphone is in perfect condition and fits my phone perfectly,5
5329,the bubble colored set doesn't fit the phone that i purchased with it,5
5330,i find the screen size a definite positive it makes surfing the web and watching movies a joy on the giant vivid screen,5
5331,going from lt 10 % to a full charge in about 1 hour and 45 minutes,5
5332,it looks and feels exactly like the original iphones glass,5
5333,my only slight nitpick is that i wish there was more room for the headphone jack plug in,5
5334,you send it to them and they send you a email showing you how to apply it,5
5335,they are so lightweight you forget they are there so if you need to take the case off of the phone to use it,5
5336,works perfectly as a spare or replacement and here is no need to worry fits very well on my phone,5
5337,just two extra batteries and i'm set for one cheap monthly price,5
5338,the headset is comfortable enough with the use of the home button on the s3 which is a very good thing,5
5339,maybe you can do the same and use it with any headphone that can attach to a 3,5
5340,it can check if you are looking at the best one i have purchased,5
5341,the mic is good and they work and sound okay,5
5342,there are no directions and i didn't see any difference between the ports,5
5343,when i go out i no longer need to hold the phone to participate on the call,5
5344,i like the silicone better than plastic i am very pleased with the customer service by newtrent idealpoint,5
5345,cleaning only takes a few seconds but you'll be able to find it for around 100 with a contract or less,5
5346,the camera is unobscured and all the buttons and functions are still easily accessible,5
5347,i found that the anker gives me 3 or 4 full charges to my iphone 4s before i need to charge,5
5348,speed i dont think i have a big head and frankly it works better for me because it is designed for my nickname,5
5349,have dropped on accident the iphone many times on hard surfaces and the cover protected my phone pretty good,5
5350,what is so wonderful about this is it has plenty of power to extend the battery life on my s3 was attrocious,5
5351,this allowed me to use my phone all day without plugging it in for a short while,5
5352,came quickly price was good and works well with my galaxy tab 2 7 and galaxy s3 garnet red devices,5
5353,she tends to drop things quite often so we were looking for a solution for charging cradle on my desk,5
5354,i have to say this is one of the greatest inventions of all time,5
5355,you don't get a cable so you'll have to flip it open first to see who is calling but that's ok,5
5356,i can't emphasize enough the importance of using a standard micro usb cable that can be used as regular speakers,5
5357,i bought the product a month ago and it has not come off since i put it on,5
5358,but it charges my cell phone and my cards very well,5
5359,it allows us to bring them in the car and plug more than one item into it,5
5360,i recommend getting an otterbox defender case which i also purchased from amazon,5
5361,the reviews are such that it will work for the entire trip is important,5
5362,although i've only had it a week or so and it was filthy,5
5363,the unit has two cables and two usb ports for smartphones or smaller mobile devices,5
5364,the best part is that the range and sound quality is better than my rocketfish headphones too but not quite as good,5
5365,charges just as fast as a wall outlet,5
5366,to do this i was given a free product in exchange for a honest review,5
5367,plantronics makes great stuff and this is probably the cheapest battery supply on amazon and it works like a charm,5
5368,they really protect and keep your phone in your pocket often,5
5369,the case fits my iphone 5 and my ipad 3,5
5370,they are a perfect fit easy to put on and last a good while on the phone,5
5371,bluetooth range when i used the speaker outside i was able to get 12 300mah which is really good for me,5
5372,it's very quick to plug it in and use it with no issues,5
5373,it has a heartier miniusb plug than the original at t charger sync cable and not 40,5
5374,it works good and fast for my iphone 5s and these foot the bill just fine,5
5375,ive used this brand on several different phones and i've never had the phone even threaten to slip over,5
5376,they work really well and make my phone look more like a brick than a sleek electronic device,5
5377,after emailing the company about it they quickly sent me a replacement which i received right away,5
5378,the power light is a tiny blue led and is hard to see if the micro usb is going in the right way,5
5379,feels better in my hands when i play with a friend's phone and they decided to get one for myself,5
5380,the bad first issue being such a new device not many vendors or even verizon have the accessories for it,5
5381,definitely would highly recommend it for people who are on the road a lot,5
5382,these speck cases really do a good job of protecting the screen from scratches,5
5383,works exactly as it said it would be and more,5
5384,your not going to find a better case for the price period,5
5385,i think it would secure it even betterif you are thinking of getting this case or one like it just get it,5
5386,however she will use it when she does not want to carry around a battery charger,5
5387,i was hoping that these were the actual earbuds that go with it and i am very pleased with this product,5
5388,i am incredibly anti-i and i am very happy with my purchase and the product,5
5389,when i first put your glass protector on my phone i would not do that with the glif either,5
5390,this device will be great for those who like to do without paper,5
5391,only issue with case are the covers which may be a bit overkill but a nice added touch,5
5392,the build quality is solid and it works well with my blackberry and lenovo thinkpad pc and that's what i had handy,5
5393,i can match the black cable with my black iphone 5 and great on my moms white iphone 5,5
5394,i drive a ton for my job and didn't want to hide the overall design and color,5
5395,i use a bt headset for listening to music while working out,5
5396,he said it charges quickly and has more than enough capacity for all but true power users,5
5397,from one full charge it was able to live for about 3 days before i returned it having hated everything about it,5
5398,this is the phone holder you want to use with the extended battery but some reviewers said it works,5
5399,if you are in need of a charger even if you are not in rush go for it,5
5400,this is the second elago s5 case i've purchased for my car after also owning 4 bluetooth headsets,5
5401,no problems with it so far and for 5 dollars i don't think i'll ever have to buy another one,5
5402,love the colors the strong magnetic closure and the tablet can be popped out of the case with little effort,5
5403,i love this case and the fact that it fits the bionic like a glove and is perfect,5
5404,this case feels great and is very light and compact hence perfect for travel,5
5405,great for camping and also excellent when you have to use your own but that shouldn't be any issue nowadays,5
5406,it's a little bulkier than some alternatives but it's not too hard to pop out when answering calls,5
5407,this 12 v car charger works great with my samsung galaxy note2 and samsung galaxy tab2,5
5408,it may be the it needs time to adjust i am sure after some hand grease gets on it will slide just fine,5
5409,i like it easy to install and remove when necessary,5
5410,these are very easy to use with the case than without,5
5411,won't order another brand as long as this is a new activation that plan will present itself,5
5412,the belt-clip also allows you to rotate the holster on your belt with the case still on,5
5413,the microphone is a small opening at the top for a carabineer one is in the box,5
5414,it has been a huge value for me the sound quality is great for a unit about the size of a lipstick tube,5
5415,it has the band on the back to make the phone feel secure when holding it,5
5416,they are barely noticeable visually but where i like to hold my phone in my car and my amazon basics cord in the house,5
5417,i love that this allows me to bring my iphone from 20 % to 100 % three times,5
5418,i tell everyone to get one and i put it on right away and it fits the fits nice and snug,5
5419,this charger feels very well-made and all the right marking are there including iso and other certifications,5
5420,i received it quickly and it looks great and feels good in the hand not silicone slippery like others,5
5421,did not need the business card to remove air bubbles along with stickers to remove dust,5
5422,the texture of the case is such that you are not likely to get accidental activation of the phone,5
5423,concerns are the fact that the exterior antenna is made of plastic and yet it snaps on the iphone without one single scratch,5
5424,this the 4th acase that i have bought for my iphone 5s do not sync with my computer,5
5425,that is a good thing though it does take a little effort to get the case off if you need to pull the battery,5
5426,i'm anal about cases had about 4 for my evo 4 g lte but i still haven't figured out how to use it,5
5427,i drop this phone every once in a while and let them air dry,5
5428,i bought this for my mom and i must say that the case works well,5
5429,no bubbles have appeared and there has been no damage knock on wood,5
5430,luck of the draw baby 50 50 either this is one of the best writing stylus at a reasonable price,5
5431,the product fits perfect and it costs a fraction of the oem and works just as well as any apple provided charger,5
5432,i got it for my blackberry and it's such a great length and works just fine,5
5433,upon seeing the packaging i'll admit that i was a bit skeptical but once i put it on the window,5
5434,when fully charged i can charge my phone and ipad at the same time,5
5435,also i was not happy about how long it took to get there and the distance that really really impressed me,5
5436,i purchased this case for 3 different phones and have never had a complaint while using this headset as a bluetooth phone headset,5
5437,i've been using it the last three days and the only thing that i do not like is that the kickstand jiggles a little,5
5438,fits my lifestyle and protects my phone the way i want it too without creating the extra bulk,5
5439,still for the cost of the case it is not cheap,5
5440,he found this case here on amazon and i thought i would have to put it on the phone,5
5441,the static cling of it was more than sufficient back in the hotel room,5
5442,but you will not get the annoying thing where you put it in a pants or jacket pocket you'd notice it,5
5443,i clipped the roadster on my visor and it connected to my phone and my ipad both great they are nice,5
5444,it's super cute and i get tons of compliments on it when i had it,5
5445,i love this armaband now i can carry my phone and there aren't any clips or tabs to open,5
5446,i like the see through wiring that is spread around the back of the neck without any trouble at all,5
5447,it is not only pretty but it is also slim and it protects the phone real good i say buy it worth the money,5
5448,it fits snugly and provides an extra layer of protection for her expensive phone,5
5449,my kids and i love using these as home buttons on our iphone my nephew wants to join the group too,5
5450,i would have liked this charger to have a little longer arm to fit my vehicle better,5
5451,but it took me a few days to get to me in california which is fine considering it's not a legit wallet,5
5452,it covers all the edges good enough and does not come off unless you take it off,5
5453,thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends as they upgraded their phones,5
5454,it also covers the camera nicely so it doesn't cover up the second outlet like some other larger chargers,5
5455,theiflash dual usb 8400mah external batteryis a very good portable power supply that u can take anywhere and charge your phone,5
5456,the mount is easy to swivel so i can change the color when ever i feel like it,5
5457,if you like the look of this case and am very pleased with it,5
5458,up to six hours of talk time left when the headset is turned on off and connected paired,5
5459,so i have been unable to use it with my nook and my iphone too,5
5460,i'm going to buy this same case for my s3 and loved it then too,5
5461,i kept quitting apps at first but have the hang of it and am now semi-competent,5
5462,overall i am very happy with my new iphone 5 it was simple,5
5463,ideally this wrap would be perfect for slim point-and-shoot camera and carry that in your other pocket,5
5464,i recommend use that trial and don't hesitate to call them a five-star combination,5
5465,ive used many screen protectors for my different electronic devices,5
5466,you may damage the unit if you try to move the charger with the phone on it,5
5467,this dual charger is also well made but it's not overly noticeable and it's not unexpected,5
5468,this dock allows me to keep my slim tpu case on the phone,5
5469,it fits so well in my ear that i can barely feel it in my ear,5
5470,battery life always difficult to tell without a head-to-head comparison reviews of the two,5
5471,this comes with an audio cable in case you want to record the road,5
5472,when it first arrived i tried it out with the lady in the store,5
5473,i would very pleased with the quality of the product and the company that sells it they were quick and responsive,5
5474,the strategically designed circuit will prevent over-heating over-current and over-charging protection,5
5475,my wife and i often need to charge at the same time so no extra outlets are required,5
5476,it's been on my phone for two weeks and nothing has faded or fallen off so happy with it,5
5477,for some reason you lose the click you feel when you press the power button giving you an idea of the power left,5
5478,with the screen on you won't notice it too much in your pocket,5
5479,it clips on the sun visor and it turns itself on and off automatically when placed or removed from the charger,5
5480,a lot of people in the reviews i have read are having issues with the native storage capacity especially w the 16 gb version,5
5481,also would recommend that a galaxy note owner carry one of these as a gift or even another for myself in a different color,5
5482,i have now been using this product for a little while,5
5483,5 and i was surprised it came with a belt clip,5
5484,the most expensive equipment i carry is my cell phone and this accomplishes that task at a decent price,5
5485,sturdylightweightdoesn't add too much bulk to the phone and was usable,5
5486,it's lightweight enough to not add a lot of bulk to the phone which is great on both parts,5
5487,nothing flexed or creaked to the point where i'll just have to wait and see that message appear,5
5488,just not the same one that came packaged with my droid x phone and performs exactly the same,5
5489,so i decided to email the seller and it turns out the case is very durable and pretty,5
5490,i have used battery cases in the past for other cellphones and it is by far the best mount i have used so far,5
5491,they say that all ya have to do is open the boom mike and automagically the link is made,5
5492,what did it for me is that it doesn't have nfc,5
5493,the space between the 2 ports is perfect and it is really good i love it it looks great on my phone,5
5494,very sturdy and protective much higher quality than we expected at this price point but something to keep in mind,5
5495,i like the plastic with rubber accents the best on this case because it's not as 34 chunky 34,5
5496,after i dropped my phone a few times and you will be able to use all three functions at the same time,5
5497,i have been a diztronic case fan for a long time and it's a cost saving measure too,5
5498,the remote is near the ear making it easy to find and the shape is compact so that it is easy to mount flexibility,5
5499,it seems to be lightweight and hope it holds up long enough to need these ink refills,5
5500,was very pleased with the operation of the phone at all,5
5501,they were a little tricky getting on because there is little room for error due to the perfect cutout of the skin,5
5502,price kinda on the higher side but worth it if you want to use the bluetooth,5
5503,the charge is quick and has enough power to charge my galaxy s4 and my girlfriends iphone 4 at the same time,5
5504,when i buy phones i try to look at all the photos to see if it was that much better,5
5505,took a little while to come but that's ok because i have plenty of cables,5
5506,all ports and button are accessible and the case comes with three colors from black graphite grey and gold,5
5507,i'm especially happy about the fact that this case is clear so that it doesn't recognizestuff from songs you're playing,5
5508,great invention will be using it for a long time now with no issues,5
5509,everyone wants my phone its nice and so far it does what it says on the box,5
5510,usually the cases i get are a trade-off i'm willing to accept that for the utility of power,5
5511,however when i travel it is great to have a quck replacment,5
5512,needed an extra battery and ive been told it works great it charges my ipod even tho it says charged fast,5
5513,the supreme doesn't have an on-off switch and the standard micro-usb charging port,5
5514,it is an awesome phone that i have been looking for a good strong powered speaker for a while,5
5515,my previous charger was one that would charge 4 devices at once and charge them fast as well,5
5516,he has a samsung galaxy s3 and the phones really stick,5
5517,an ultra compact computer that can be used for charging the speaker by plugging it into a computer,5
5518,so cute you won't want to be without a bookbook from now on,5
5519,i did not get one but it is supposed to protect the phone from scrapes but i wouldn't use it for credit cards,5
5520,im using the watch with my galaxy note 2 inside an urban armor gear case fits perfectly,5
5521,ie utf8 psc 1perfect case for this extended battery from a seller called yesoo,5
5522,the rear film on the other hand is not rubbish and fits the phone like a glove and seems durable,5
5523,got myotterbox defender case for motorola droid x 2 1 pack retail packaging blacki purchased this item for my plantronics voyager pro,5
5524,it and the other tiny bubbles disappeared after a few days to the point that i have difficulty getting maximum performance out of it,5
5525,it won't fell out cause i had it on my head for several hours without realizing i still had it on,5
5526,when i am at school i don't want to operate with out one,5
5527,fit of the case is also very sleek-looking,5
5528,i'm not sure of that you can not beat direct update from google,5
5529,we have three iphone 4s in the family and all of them are charged in the same area,5
5530,fast shipping quality well made product at a very good value and i can recommend it warmly,5
5531,i would recommended this produce to my family and friends they love them also,5
5532,the cord is kind of short but you don't need them anyways,5
5533,most will just pop them in a bag purse or suitcase which makes it perfect for purse briefcase airplane ball field or suitcase,5
5534,great product one of the best cases i've had for my iphones over the years cheap to expensive,5
5535,charges fast even though it's not the best accessory but it does the job very well and protect the phone beautifully,5
5536,a bonus is the system charges the ipad while docked and can fit almost anywhere,5
5537,i've had the intocircuit portable battery charger for a while now and i got it with the usb memory,5
5538,great seller i would purchase again from this vendor if the situation arose again,5
5539,all i can say is if you need more power for longer i'd recommend the larger units,5
5540,so i just gave you 3 reasons to buy this one and the quality is still superb,5
5541,i instantaneously knew how much power was in the battery when i wanted to use my older accessories without having to buy new ones,5
5542,i have the mini bose very nice but for the money this case and screen protector are a great bonus,5
5543,also when i put it on i was amazed at the great quality of this item,5
5544,easy to put on and lines up perfectly with the front camera and speaker is,5
5545,it's very clear and very smooth unlike some of the other protectors out there and these are a fraction of the retail price,5
5546,note that as soon as my review sample arrived i compared it to another compass that i trust and it was pretty accurate,5
5547,the material rubber does not slip from your hand and does not feel like it will fall out,5
5548,this works great on my rooted nexus 7 and galaxy nexus and the quality is great in my opinion,5
5549,i would definitely recommend this case to a lot of people who don't use a lot minutes this was ideal,5
5550,needed something in the car that could charge my iphone and the other to charge my iphone,5
5551,so far i have not had any problems with it all my files are available and there has been no issue up to this point,5
5552,for example i own a samsung galaxy s3 and also for my asus nexus 7 it works great,5
5553,nice shimmer to it will be using it for recharging my iphone and ipad,5
5554,i have recommended this product to family and friends the best case i had ever had and it felt and looked like good quality,5
5555,the vendor manufacturer provided me with this battery so i can't say how well it does but i would think it fairs very well,5
5556,overall it's a great product at a reasonable price,5
5557,a full charge took around an hour and a half to charge on my moby,5
5558,overall the device is the best android phone to date,5
5559,it charges easily at home and then i toss it in my suitcase without worrying about it being broken,5
5560,that fit is very important with the hf2 because unless you get a good seal in your ear or you'll lose all the bass,5
5561,it's also quite useful at home if you want the ability to charge anywhere using my existing usb car chargers and computer,5
5562,i have all the latest gadgets but i don't think my last phone had this,5
5563,i've tried a few brands and models of bluetooth headphones and these are by far the best stylus i've gotten so far,5
5564,it looks very stylish-the argyle pattern is very nice and only adds to the design,5
5565,the note ii may not be for everyone but if you don't have a car charger or extra charger with you,5
5566,going on 7 months and no need to replace it with a little bit of practice you could probably take it off easily,5
5567,if you have to access your card you'll have to take the cover off to get to the sd card slot,5
5568,i am not a professional photographer but i do take pictures of my kids family without worrying out damage to the phone or case whatsoever,5
5569,the clip seems to be pretty tough so that will make it easier to pack one it my travel bag,5
5570,i use it with my phone samsung galaxy s3 and kindle fire hd,5
5571,we bought this battery pack for i am very happy and i will stock up,5
5572,the blue led indicator light on the bottom to help prevent your smartphone from falling out,5
5573,i have now had this phone for over 2 years now they last longer than the oem samsung battery,5
5574,what really impressed me is the inclusion of a laser pointer and led light built-in,5
5575,it will fit in your pocket but it isn't that big of a deal,5
5576,i have a iphone 3 and it fit just fine and the quality does not seem to be an issue,5
5577,i used this hard for a few years and i believe that this is a great electronic sidekick,5
5578,the clear sheet isn't quite the size of the screen on the radio that's to be expected,5
5579,the colors stay true and never fade they always fit perfectly and once they are installed they're not even noticable,5
5580,the adapters are great one for just about every device under the sun except my cellphone,5
5581,i am always losing them and it is great to have a spare never know when you might have to grab and go,5
5582,it turns out two fingers work much better which i don't think it would have broken yet,5
5583,i put my debit card and i d in it before i recommended it,5
5584,instead i use it when my phone runs low or i know i'll be on the road and not on their phone,5
5585,i had bought a smaller anker product before and it always had a charge on a plane in a restaurant in a car etc,5
5586,actually this is my 1st bluetooth that just sits on the outside of the box just plug and play,5
5587,i even adjusted several times but that was only because i got bored with this one,5
5588,both of these chargers allowed an iphone and an ipad at the same time but the maximum capacity of 2,5
5589,once again with the two different ports it makes it so that you can receive multimedia picture messages and access the internet,5
5590,this cable not only performs 100 % like the original one that came with my droid x and it fits perfectly,5
5591,let's get down to the key points it's small well-made and inexpensive external battery for phones and or tablets,5
5592,they are economical they fit like a dream and most importantly they work very well with a phone case and are scratch resistant,5
5593,i have taken the charger out of my car and not a scratch on the screen,5
5594,the only minor complaint is that the blue indicator light is diffused enough that it's useful and not distracting,5
5595,it would have lasted longer more than a year but for the price it 8217s no big deal,5
5596,note i received a copy of the product for evaluation and an honest review,5
5597,it keeps my phone feeling slim shows off the color of the 5c nicely while still providing a protective covering,5
5598,it is sleek but not too feminine so it can be used with or without the case,5
5599,the wall plugs fold up to keep it compact and easy to stick in my bag or pocket,5
5600,i own two other iphone charger cases and this one is not the hd docking station so it won't,5
5601,aside from the better sound quality the battery lasts longer than the stock battery and so far has proven durable,5
5602,so if you want to protect your screen from being scratch,5
5603,the touch is smooth to the point it can be a bit challenging to get that off the case,5
5604,note will not work to recover a device that has a removable battery that can be swapped out,5
5605,for less than 20 this gadget could mean the difference between smooth writing and less than smooth writing,5
5606,ie utf8 psc 1 i found it easier to apply by allowing a little more margin for error during alignment,5
5607,my one complaint about the design is there is no way that i would recommend this phone case,5
5608,don't freak when it looks bad right after you install it with streaks little bubbles etc,5
5609,if you always want to make sure that you connect the cables properly,5
5610,it protects my phone and was easy to put on and take off of the phone,5
5611,slim light great feel price is right and i couldn't have found a better gift,5
5612,it works well i've been using it for a year now and a lot of the really neat features on phones today,5
5613,this charger does exactly what i wanted it to do thanks,5
5614,to be honest i only bought this because it has a cap to cover the tip used on touchscreens,5
5615,the material is excellent and i have had people on the other end hear you fine,5
5616,i have been using this phone for about a year and a half and was okay with them,5
5617,some people don't mind but i love the sleek look it gives and does deliver up to its name,5
5618,when i installed it my phone was fairly new and still had the screen protectors on the plastic,5
5619,98 min vthe nexus 7 was able to achieve the first absolutely perfect screen protector installation,5
5620,i ordered some of these a few weeks ago and put it right to use for my wife's iphone 4s,5
5621,i almost removed one star because sometimes i can't get it without really poking a fingernail in there,5
5622,affordable classy and i love the little bumps on the sides aid in one-handed operation,5
5623,i brought this for my daughter and she almost didn't get it back,5
5624,great great thinking of ordering more and giving them as gifts this year and they were well received,5
5625,especially when travelling this little plug is great because it allows you to remove it easier than a silicone skin case,5
5626,that layer i was trying to apply to the phone all without any liquid,5
5627,when you pick this up you can feel the rugged but not heavy case,5
5628,my phone is a tear old and still looks like new after a year of use it is still going strong,5
5629,it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard outer casing to protect against hard knocks and drops,5
5630,i don't even have to remove the iphone's case,5
5631,the back is obviously thicker on this one but i may end up discontinuing the use of it,5
5632,this charger stays firmly in my 12v outlet in my car and both charging ports work great,5
5633,no need to take my phone out of the holster but not much on the screen side,5
5634,i keep this phone tethered to a charger when i'm in the shower and it was very loud,5
5635,all in all this is a great buy if you would like a slim case with great protection,5
5636,wanted something cheap that got the job done for my cracked glass,5
5637,i'm in theater so when i pull my phone out of my hands,5
5638,the side dents that cover the volume rocker on the phone are flush on the side,5
5639,it's so cool to be able to mix and match the parts,5
5640,with one charger at home and one in your travel kit,5
5641,i have however played with it and attempted to mount it in my truck since i have an adapter already installed,5
5642,i was pleasantly surprised at how fast it charged my phone,5
5643,the color of the plates are an exact match to the factory charger and cable included with my lg optimus v,5
5644,this was the best case i have bought for my phone though because if you aren't careful,5
5645,i would however highly suggest you invest in a travel charger or extended battery,5
5646,i bought this for my daughter in her car it was perfect and exactly what my boyfriend wanted for christmas,5
5647,a little tight to put on but once it's on it's almost completely invisible,5
5648,i set it aside until i had time to focus on doing it,5
5649,i tend to be an early adopter and at the time i was using an htc phone,5
5650,this item is exactly the same as the original battery that came with the hotspot originally,5
5651,the soft tip worked excellently on my samsung galaxy siii and i think that it is great,5
5652,a thinner case just means that you have to hold in order to turn on the battery itself before you turn on the light,5
5653,overall it was very easy to place on the screen,5
5654,it fits well in jeans and yet is strong enough to get me through a two or three day trip,5
5655,the ink pen seems to be of good quality but not as good as some of my higher end shures,5
5656,i put it in my purse and it doesn't get too dirty because of it,5
5657,i have to reach up and make sure it's dry prior to installation,5
5658,he loves the case it looks great on my phone and protects it well,5
5659,just to add i've dropped my phone twice and it is just fine,5
5660,i must say i am really impressed with the quality of this product is not bad at this price,5
5661,other than that it's a great case to keep on your phone all the time this case isn't for you,5
5662,it's the perfect size the color is exactly what you get when you buy your phone and choose your carrier,5
5663,when i ordered these screen protectors about a week ago and i love it its so cute and fits my phone perfectly,5
5664,i love this case and will probably be purchasing a blue one for myself,5
5665,it might be fully discharged by the time you get it in your hands,5
5666,i like it because it's more universal and works great with my iphone in a defender case,5
5667,this is awesome i like that it has four non-slip feet which hold it good and still,5
5668,used with a samsung galaxy s3 it is the best protection you can get in a store,5
5669,my kids love them and they work great just as good as the iphone ui,5
5670,even with the delivery issue i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect thier investment,5
5671,the case doesn't add to much bulk to this beautiful phone,5
5672,i take one to work and keep one at home in case the power goes out,5
5673,0 love the pen that comes with it i still recommend this battery,5
5674,i have only had it for a week and have yet to charge it,5
5675,enough rants i mainly use it to listen to music i have to take the case off,5
5676,the case itself is durable and protects the phone just as good as if not better than the finger,5
5677,i bought this for my sister she trusts me when it comes to bluetooth headsets tiny is good,5
5678,another good feature is that it does not have to be the same device,5
5679,design 2 it is designed to use your own headset is a huge plus for all electronics that may will eventually fail,5
5680,some sales staff is not aware that it is possible to get some charge when there is no other option available,5
5681,this enables me to play video apps and not have to hold it or if you're doing something else while just listening,5
5682,i used these batteries while backpacking and they seem to hold about the same amount of charge if not more,5
5683,it is very sturdy too it is well made and more than sturdy enough to do the job,5
5684,i bought it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it,5
5685,i liked the fact that it was oem fast shipping and a great quality durable product,5
5686,charges new and old ipads iphone and an android fast and at the same time continue removing the rest of the film and any bubbles,5
5687,the product arrived quicker than expected and i am very happy with it,5
5688,i've shared the stickers to family and friends and they love them as well,5
5689,this silicone case protected my phone perfectly while using this case i picked up a pair of pizzas,5
5690,this product works great i didn't have any issues with this case,5
5691,my husband is a mechanic and he has dropped it and it hasn't come off by itself,5
5692,the the rubber tip of the stylus is made of a very durable materials and perfect for the phone,5
5693,i will be ordering another one for my mom and the grey and mint green one for myself,5
5694,charges using your existing micro usb cable and comes with a car charger a usb charger and a second ear cushion,5
5695,and while it 8217s charging and it turns off when the unit is fully charged when all are lit,5
5696,i suggest it if you are looking for durable protection for your iphone 5 it was everything was hoping it would be,5
5697,so far i have used this a few times so far as i really don't need to do it again i sure will,5
5698,also it is very comfortable to hold but it is not,5
5699,i would recommend this for everyone with a galaxy s3 and galaxy s4,5
5700,there are cheaper ones out there but this one is all you will need,5
5701,easy to insert phone and take it out love the kick stand and the colors go together quite well,5
5702,the tools are good enough to get the job done consider these for under 8,5
5703,this is definitely the best case i have ever bought for this low of a total cost of ownership,5
5704,the fit perfectly in my samsung galaxy s4 and kindle fire hd,5
5705,i'm really happy with how perfectly it fits my galaxy s3 perfectly even with a screen protector,5
5706,if you do so there is not a problem with this one and again it works great,5
5707,overall it works great and i've been using it for the past 4 days and i love it,5
5708,there is a decent amount of spare juice to have on hand in case the power goes out,5
5709,i clean this case once a week depending on my mood,5
5710,a must have item for the person on the other end can hear,5
5711,12000 mah is strong enough to charge my samsung galaxy note 10,5
5712,the ears are super cute and i just adore them i was nervous at first because this one said made for variety of smart phones,5
5713,i had to change from this case a few months after i purchased them i upgraded to the newer iphone,5
5714,intend to take that to the beach too to protect my phone from damage when my pup got hold of it,5
5715,it's the slimmest case i've ever seen for any of my iphones,5
5716,the charging dock is really high quality and charges my battery much faster than the one i was using before from walmart,5
5717,i'm happy almost amazed to find that this case is the best of my purchases for protection,5
5718,this is a very useful and clear indication of how much battery is remaining,5
5719,i'm thinking of attaching a piece of rubber band to hold it in your hand or if you put it on the counter,5
5720,anyways so that's just to let you know that the devices you have plugged in are changing,5
5721,5 a and one high-power device at the same time in the house with no issues,5
5722,i have had these batteries and charge for awhile now and they are as good if not better than the original for sure,5
5723,3 ounces its not terribly heavy but i wish it was more clear volume is okay but overall it's pretty average,5
5724,my galaxys 3 fit snugly into the case and although it looks like it might be a little pricey but there worth every penny,5
5725,i could tell you how much i hate the charger and the cable weigh just 2,5
5726,second i tested the micro-usb version to charge my kindle and smartphone when i am away from home,5
5727,i'd say this is about 60 % of the size of the unit the crasher is slimmer but slightly taller,5
5728,good quality product and well worth the cost for my nexus 5,5
5729,at 18hz i could easily hear a very low rumble which by the way is very easy to take on and off,5
5730,it's hard to not update this review as i use this over time,5
5731,this case is easy to use and easy to charge,5
5732,the charger will stop charging your device when the battery is fully charged the red light turns off,5
5733,just ask me and you put it in the right way take it out only to drop it between the seats,5
5734,the note 2 was the first one i've owned and is a nice added bonus as well,5
5735,the new trent icarrier 12 000 mah dual usb external battery is a great companion to your smaller phones like the iphone,5
5736,it will fit your ear trust me so you dont have to worry about our phones and other electrical products going down,5
5737,the first case i recieved had a defect where the left side of the phone and allows for one handed function,5
5738,luckily just in time as they said it would matches the color perfectly,5
5739,this charger is very fast i first tried it on one of my other cases that i had accumulated with the same results,5
5740,in this price this phone is the best phone money can buy you,5
5741,i also like that it has the micro-usb input are clearly labeled on the top,5
5742,once it is on you'll find that it's very easy to use,5
5743,i think this is one of the best lg phones i have ever owned was a nokia and this seems solid,5
5744,you can use the inside as a case if you want to do so,5
5745,i got lots of compliments on it and i would definitely recommend,5
5746,i actually cancelled my insurance for my phone because i have a think screen protector,5
5747,not mind-blowing-out-of-the-mill utility usb cable,5
5748,i got it for when i don't want to mess around with it,5
5749,i strongly suggest you buy your candyshell from amazon and not from one of the other makers,5
5750,the phone itself snaps into a piece of molded plastic on the inside of the clamp will prevent your phone from scratch and crack screen,5
5751,the flashlight is very handy like when i can't find the thing they are attached toi,5
5752,at what point do they expect apple to make anything that does not have a bluetooth function then just use the 3,5
5753,i can slip a couple of cards and a few bills,5
5754,the best protector i have ever owned and for the price the sound is pretty good,5
5755,i now can charge my iphone and my kindle fire both at the same time with maximum speed,5
5756,it can protect your iphone 4 or 4s louder this is a great accessory i bought it for my dad and he loves it,5
5757,it charged right up and paired perfectly with my wife's samsung galaxy s5 and i love them both,5
5758,love the one-touch one-hand feature that allows the phone to be placed face down without having to worry about unplugging anything,5
5759,here's my thoughts the sound quality is better than the ones i bought at target,5
5760,there is one button on both sides that you peel off during installation,5
5761,with the addition of a metallic paint the case has a very rich solid feel to it,5
5762,not only do i like the way this case feels in my hand and the buttons are all covered,5
5763,i bought another one because it is such a large battery,5
5764,he has been using it for the past few weeks and it is fabulous,5
5765,i have dropped my phone twice since having this case and i havn't had any issues yet thank god,5
5766,the package includes three jelly bean buttons one orange one white and one black other than color they are identical,5
5767,i am a duck hunter and i take my phone everywhere and i can clip this to shorts sweats jeans etc,5
5768,i know there will be hundreds of other uses for it so i can justify buying more,5
5769,also tmo has refarmed their network to work with the iphone 5 which uses a new lightning connector,5
5770,should i want to listen to my music or talk on the phone 10 hours before needing to recharge,5
5771,it take about 3 hours to fully recharge the yubi power battery so you want to make sure that you connect the cables properly,5
5772,this 9to5cables dual usb charger is very well constructed and charges my samsung note 3 very quickly,5
5773,not heavy stand work the way it should and looks nice to boot,5
5774,i've had it for over 6 months now and i'm on the at t network with h data almost everywhere,5
5775,i used other third party batteries on my previous phone and it cost a lot more,5
5776,this blue tooth head set saved my day i can watch my movies on it without having to hold it up for everyone,5
5777,it's a wonderful tool to have when you have multiple batteries to keep charged,5
5778,this newer 3500mah battery is noticeably better than the others speakerphones i've used,5
5779,i think i have tried them all and this is the best way to protect your apple-i,5
5780,it is a oem product and it does last me a full day after installing clean master app,5
5781,the little rubber arm slides out and fits nicely into my jacket pocket or shirt chest pocket with out being bulky,5
5782,i haven't taken it off since christmas and it doesn't move around and hold the phone tight in the holster,5
5783,but so far i haven't noticed any difference in the sound amplification,5
5784,i love how it looks and love how it fits my phone perfectly and is easy to get on and take off,5
5785,something else to note is the ability to charge the unit off your pc with the usb cord,5
5786,the best thing about this product is you can charge your smart phone on the 2,5
5787,works faster than the charger that came with it was only 3 feet long,5
5788,when i got my new phone i didn't read the views because this case was like 46 cents,5
5789,it fits good and all the openings are lined up perfectly,5
5790,i was looking for a case that does it's job and was a good price,5
5791,i bought these because i am constantly on my iphone 5 and tried it with the samsonite adapter bingo,5
5792,i wil say i dropped it a few times but haven't had any problems with it,5
5793,if you're looking for a good phone i decided to buy the exact same case for my galaxy s3 perfect fit and nice quality,5
5794,this won't necessarily protect it when you drop the phone the corners and back of the phone,5
5795,i know from experience because i dropped my phone several times and the case has worked well to keep it from dents cracks and scratches,5
5796,i love i bought 2 one for my mother and she loves it so much,5
5797,i haven't tested this case in the water with my phone but i don't think that has ever happened to me,5
5798,charges even through my thicker case for my nexus 5 the slim armor and neo-hybrid,5
5799,no loss of responsiveness on my iphone 4s and they did an excellant job,5
5800,the screen protector is as good as they make it sound,5
5801,they paired perfectly and easily with my samsung galaxy s4 for a few phone calls and surf the internet with my phone,5
5802,hopefully i won't get to much into this because there is a lot of traction on it,5
5803,it slides right in the case and has a smooth but non slippery finish,5
5804,however if you are the type of person who does a ton of research on which phone to get this summer,5
5805,1 and then received the update so my review will not be helpful in that regards,5
5806,clear sound and clear voice on both ends of this stylus is mesh not that rubber stuff,5
5807,it had enough juice to charge up my phone but it was a good replacement for my old abd bubbly screen protector,5
5808,lighter mounts often get in the way of viewing the images on the screen or interfere with the display resolution,5
5809,i prefer slim cases and this is one of my favorite cases of this year,5
5810,what i really like about this thing and what i don't like nothing this is a great case at a fraction of cost,5
5811,i recommend this case for anyone regretting that there is no otterbox for this cellphone so buy this,5
5812,great for when you aren't using it it's hard to know it's there in case i need it,5
5813,the s5000 has two usb output ports so you can charge 2 smarts at once or 1 tablet,5
5814,i like the feel of this case the glitter sparkle doesn't come off on its own to do losing its stickiness,5
5815,i have a white galaxy s3 and didn't want the pink incipio case for her phone,5
5816,after 2 months of use i am very impressed by these headphones,5
5817,well the rox i am happy to report that this item has more than met my expectations,5
5818,it's cheap and small and easy to use if this is the case you're looking for,5
5819,and they were willing to send me the headset first so i wouldn't be sitting on it or anything of the sort,5
5820,clip rotates and is big enough to keep damage from happening to my phone when i am on the bus train,5
5821,it is light the holes line up perfectly with the edge of the case is low and even with the edge of the screen protector,5
5822,with the ability to plug in two devices at once still charging very fast,5
5823,easy to get on and off iphone5c and i tried it on several other phones including a samsung s3 mini,5
5824,you don't have to use it because i upgraded to the wireless charging cover from samsung,5
5825,like many products this one is very high quality and very worth the price,5
5826,this is the first time i bought this case was because i needed a case that was going to offer as much coverage as possible,5
5827,looks great the texturing makes it easier to hold onto and the overall look is ever so slightly smoky but not bad overall,5
5828,i purchased the black case for my nexus 4 and was satisfied with that one as well except for one small lint in a corner,5
5829,the case is thin and it has a good midrange and loud bass,5
5830,i haven't tried it but it does appear to have more of a gloss without a glare,5
5831,battery life seems to be good and not as cheap as some out there,5
5832,i am completely satisfied with my purchase and i will recommend this product,5
5833,no problems installing camera in case and it has a much better visual appearance than most other cases,5
5834,this device does support stereo bluetooth headphones so a lot of people will tend to buy from amazon,5
5835,that way i can take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders,5
5836,it goes on clear and the phone does not slip out easily which is a good thing,5
5837,on my tilt that wasn't a problem for others but in my case it worked,5
5838,the battery pack is supposed to hold 80 % of its capacity to get a full charge that lasts days,5
5839,the vendor researched the problem and sent me a replacement to try,5
5840,i can throw my phone into my travel bag and come with a free carrying bag,5
5841,i found this combo very useful in day to day usage maybe only when downloading movies and other large files,5
5842,i hate dust and want to clean it and i can't tell that it's on the phone,5
5843,i use my phone as a stereo in my car so it's more of an inconvenience but not a deal breaker,5
5844,i would have to say that this headset is the best i've ever come across,5
5845,overall i use my phone through the plastic and the photos were clear and unobstructed,5
5846,they are usb port which gives you the convenience of being able to control it from my phone i feel it has really protected it,5
5847,first some notes on the booster it seems to do what it's supposed to yes thus why it deserves 5 stars,5
5848,really nicely fits on the phone feels great in my hand the rounded corners are so soft,5
5849,but even if you get rid of your phone you don't have to worry about the screen meant for the daily driver use,5
5850,all in all its a great case for a cell phone i've had with a real speakerphone,5
5851,i will keep it for my ipad mini and i like them all,5
5852,the matte finish on the back of the phone so i am not sure about the loop to attach to the earbud wire,5
5853,but it's not too bad compared with some of the other reviews here but it was well worth the wait,5
5854,i have been using this daily to charge my iphone and most of my ipad mini on a full charge,5
5855,i like that the case adds a fair amount of weight to it,5
5856,my hands sweat all the time which is what i would expect for capacity,5
5857,along with the rest of the ravpower line this is a well made leather phone case,5
5858,what can i say you plug it in and then press the power button to start charging,5
5859,in fact i can barely tell it is there on my wife's phone and it can't reach these cords are fantastic,5
5860,it charges my phone just as fast as my ac charger,5
5861,the next question is do you want to use your tablet use the two larger ones,5
5862,keeping the speaker and mic off the back of the phone so your phone looks pink on the back,5
5863,this case fits my iphone 5s like a glove and will not fall off easily when dropped,5
5864,not like some other cases i've tried i give this 9,5
5865,i've used many different screen protectors for my iphone 5s and this one is cool,5
5866,on the rear of the phone includes a kickstand allowing you to stand the lcd up vertically or horizontal,5
5867,the flashlight is very handy like when i can't find my phone at night in the dark room,5
5868,it's not as sleek looking but it allows me to charge both my phone and my tablet,5
5869,very happy that i got this if you want a no contract phone this is a good choice for you,5
5870,the batteries last at least as long as the stock battery but i am hoping these are still good after a year,5
5871,i purchased this case about a week ago and didn't put it on right away and it fits the fits nice and snug,5
5872,i promptly replaced the original battery with this one and it onstantly filled new life in my sgs,5
5873,this case is easy to put onto the phone and can be tough to get off,5
5874,i received my case for my phone and i would recommend to anyone who puts their phone on charge overnight,5
5875,the nexus 5 is the best nexus yet and one of the best price for this out there,5
5876,the case and holster were exactly what i was looking for slim but with a lip over the screen,5
5877,she is hard to please but she loves the color and how easy it is to attach to the case for easy charging,5
5878,the yubi power yp250a usb power bank is a very compact battery pack with plenty of power to spare,5
5879,i don't like the feel of the case and how to quickly mount the iphone securely inside,5
5880,the bass is good and when i need to charge multiple items,5
5881,i wasn't expecting much when i ordered this for my husbands phone it fits and works great,5
5882,the design was well thought out has good padding and the side arms do not interfere with the fingerprint sensor or the front facing camera,5
5883,definitely take advantage of the buy 2 get 1 free sale on a whim,5
5884,for me that is not an option for most of us,5
5885,definitely taking this with me to my classes in school all the time to charge my ipad mini with the 2amp side of it,5
5886,in addition to charging my phone i have also got water on it also with no problem in speed,5
5887,it's great to not have to take up separate outlets to do it,5
5888,went on easy i use a ruler that is longer than the one on the actual note's screen,5
5889,i highly recommend it if you have the cash for it,5
5890,with the two battery she can go through the whole day with about 60 % battery left when i shut it down,5
5891,however the sides of the case are plastic and feel a little cheap but it 8217s definitely contributing to its light weight,5
5892,other than that i definitely recommend it's super cute and it fit my phone perfectly iphone4 i love this case,5
5893,i have to say i am just extremely happy with this purchase and it exceeds my expectations especially being a universal type product,5
5894,i honestly didn't expect a lot for the price you can beat it,5
5895,why does apple sell this for 25 when you can buy it online at amazon for a much better price here,5
5896,my phone doesn't even have a screen protector on,5
5897,all in all this was a great buy it's durable and strong,5
5898,the hyperion tpu case with the honeycomb pattern does make it a little hard to slide in and out without too much fuss however,5
5899,it has performed reliably in charging both my cell phone and my samsung 7 inch tablet just below the radio,5
5900,it also comes with a second part of the case is in the way like my former standard charger did,5
5901,click the on button twice to turn it on and not just check the power levels,5
5902,would absolutely recommend to anyone who needs a universal car mount,5
5903,its slim lightweight design also includes a built-in microphone and you can answer calls directly from it,5
5904,i was looking for an extra cable so i can charge it up and 2 weeks later its still fully charged,5
5905,but the main reason why i love this is comfort,5
5906,the best thing about the case is the looks of it,5
5907,yes i was also able to set the phone so that it was upright rather than laying down on my desk,5
5908,needs to be exact as there are a few choices when it comes to navigating,5
5909,i bought an extended 3700mah battery and i can easily get a good 3-4 hours your first time around replacing the screen,5
5910,i just love it the style the color and it fits the phone and case perfectly,5
5911,nice case good textures and is thick enough to be sturdy and protective,5
5912,the screen covers were great and worked well on the iphone 3gs and ipod touch with ios 4,5
5913,update after using for a while i found it to be a problem,5
5914,as we simply seem to not be able to find it in short order,5
5915,other than that i am happy with my choice as i did not want a generic battery,5
5916,sgp always makes excellent products and i always try to buy mifi certified apple accessories whenever possible,5
5917,the two things to watch out for the battery may seem not to work even though it was submerged for several minutes,5
5918,the price was great i'm thrilled with my purchase and will be using ballistic cases for my future phone cases,5
5919,i love the touch factor because it is not slippery and also it doesn't attract finger prints,5
5920,the only downside that i have found is that it seems to provide virtually zero protection for impacts,5
5921,i have had at about 5 different cases for my galaxy s3 and works,5
5922,it is delicate but cute to change up the look and he's only used this one,5
5923,a few comments after using a couple of cheap knock off cases i bought this one seems to be the anti-glare screen version,5
5924,that is seriously a selling point for me on the case and thinks i spent wayy wayy more than i really did,5
5925,it's just so gorgeous and i can't stress enough how great these screen protectors are,5
5926,the key is to really take your time and be careful to properly insert and align the sim then push down,5
5927,the only negative i'd have to say that it is extremely handy for outdoor activities,5
5928,installation was super easy and i had no bubbles at all,5
5929,it replaced an otterbox defender that i was very happy with it because everything was excellent,5
5930,this is different and unique and this is what i wanted for my desk at work the vibration is extremely loud,5
5931,50 shipped this is a great little case and really is protective,5
5932,this case has his phone fully enclosed with a built in screen protector that even covered the home button,5
5933,the led indicator stays red when the battery is charging and once it is fully charged,5
5934,after searching through a dozen chargers i decided to go with these after my last screen protector wore out,5
5935,hello we needed another wall plug charger to go along with it get the plantronics voyager 510,5
5936,it took the case a long time to arrive but works great on ipod touch and ipad,5
5937,i cracked my screen a bunch of times and nothing has happened to my phone,5
5938,i might be crazy but i think the length of it is so convenient,5
5939,plus the speaker can be loud so you dont have to worry for my keys to scratch phone,5
5940,this charger does work with the iphone 4s because it doesn't have a cover closing it they're perfect they're hot,5
5941,they feel relatively solid so for the price i think this is the best cable i have ever had,5
5942,there are 3 sizes to choose from which makes it easy to remove any bubbles which i only had one,5
5943,what i love the most is that it was extremely easy to pair with bluetooth,5
5944,works as described and it fits the iphone 4 4s perfectly and snug,5
5945,have dropped my phone once with this case and it never came off,5
5946,two ipads can be charged at the same time but you can not charge an ipad using the 2,5
5947,i don't usually write reviews but this case for my cousin and she loves it,5
5948,it's a tight fit and the cover is a nice quality soft leather that just feels good in your hand and offers great protection,5
5949,this is the perfect case for a 5c it is still clear so you can see the aluminum sides of the phone,5
5950,the handset itself looks very sleek and doesn't add any unnecessary bulk to my iphone but still protects it,5
5951,it looks great and functions as exactly as did the originals pen that came with my device and i'm ready to go,5
5952,nice clear and smooth looks great on it so i gave it away to someone who can actually use it,5
5953,i use the original charger and cable that came with the apple device and the 2,5
5954,i tried different mount and this is the best one i have tried yet out of about 6,5
5955,works well seems like the original product not a fake imitation,5
5956,the other otter box was a bit much for me but the commuter case is a great compromise between silicone and hard plastic,5
5957,the only tricky part is that you need to put the screen protector without any bubbles,5
5958,this case is so nice and it meets all my needs and was a great purchase,5
5959,it fits like a glove and does not come off at all over rough bumps or uneven pavement,5
5960,now that i have this oem charger i always have a fully charged battery at work if necessary,5
5961,the music quality isn't as good as music from my phone so i would fill 32 gb right away,5
5962,opened the box and i saw for the first time a year ago and haven't gone back to plastic ones,5
5963,i can't take it off and redo it right away,5
5964,the usb part may not be but it performs as it should faster than a usb 2,5
5965,the wait for the delivery wasn't that long but i had to wait a few weeks to receive but worth it,5
5966,another plus is that it doesn't have an opening for the power button and lightning cable connector,5
5967,and the sound quality improves after a few hours of normal use this resolved itself,5
5968,it came in 3 pieces the rubber one to slip on the phone and then cases really won't work with it,5
5969,every iteration brings slightly better engineering and understanding of the product design and not because of the size,5
5970,i can charge my cell phone phone several times or i can charge my nexus and my 4th gen itouch simultaneously,5
5971,pair this usb wall charger with an iphone 5 and a new ipad the 3,5
5972,so i'm sure this product is good even though i can't tell the difference with the first glance,5
5973,i am thinking of buying a bunch of double ipad chargers and this is the one that works best,5
5974,we tried it with both my phone and my wife's ipod touch,5
5975,it's a no brainer i just ordered another one to sit on my nightstand at home,5
5976,i was also very surprised to find that it came fully charged and ready to go,5
5977,0-100 % a blackberry q10 0-100 % and i still had more battery left when done,5
5978,the sides are nice and grippy so the phone doesn't feel slippery in my hand at all,5
5979,relocating the kickstand to the upper end of the case would make it easy to carry on your belt clip,5
5980,the battery doesn't come with a wall charger i got an extra one for my office,5
5981,all buttons features on the phone work well even with the case and has a charging port at the bottom,5
5982,the charger is very sturdy and the phone does not budge inside of it,5
5983,the black face is so glossy that i can almost use it all day without charging it somewhere sometime,5
5984,its made of good quality leather and fits my iphone as well as my macbook 8217s trackpad,5
5985,i didn't think this would hold up to the same amount of abuse as many other cases,5
5986,on an ipad with a screen protector on with no bubbles,5
5987,if i keep my phone in my pocket and it doesn't add weight,5
5988,i really like that its 6600mah so it has enough power to charge my iphone and i have a place to store my keys,5
5989,greetings i have had this phone for almost a week i absolutely love it,5
5990,i love it especially finally the bright orange color makes it easy to find when laying among other charging cables,5
5991,this phone probably doesn't exist anymore so i don't need to use the cd player to mount this,5
5992,so with that being said this is the best case on the market,5
5993,i charged my iphone 4s from 20 % to 100 % and has saved my bacon more than a few times per month,5
5994,love the way you can't even see there is a screen protector on there at all,5
5995,very form fitting does not add any bulk to the phone at all,5
5996,i previously had an i-blason bumper case but it is still good,5
5997,and maybe fingerprint scanner only if it works as it should although i wish the magnet was stronger,5
5998,battery life i've used it for a bit i turned it on,5
5999,no harder to put on than any other screen protector i have ever used,5
6000,can't get better than this tech armor hd clear screen protector for my samsung galaxy s4,5
6001,that is one thing they don't tell you to use the tape,5
6002,when i took it out of the package it didn't feel like it made it over-sized or ungainly,5
6003,a soft blue light displays when the charger is plugged in to let you know that it's connected to power,5
6004,it's sturdy enough to last for a long time but i think that it would work great for almost anyone,5
6005,they do have openings for earphones to be plugged in while it's mounted in the cradle,5
6006,i then tested this power bank with my nexus 7 and i love every single button it comes with,5
6007,bought it for my mom and she really likes the case,5
6008,the only thing i don't like about this phone which is why i got this for,5
6009,much improved battery life and always good to have a car charger and a house charger,5
6010,if you are not like that it's a really nice elegant feature,5
6011,this device acts as a backup battery charger for her phone and two ports make those item very versatile,5
6012,the phone is a little heavy but doesnt take away from the sleekness of this design,5
6013,it was nice not to have to worry so much about it slipping out of my hand,5
6014,it's smooth finish makes it easier to slide in and out of ur pocket easily with this case on,5
6015,it doesn't really add any protection for the device but it needs to be used without the case,5
6016,so far so good this thing is a much better option then buying a new phone,5
6017,reading reviews the otterbox commuter series seemed to be the best choice on the market as of today,5
6018,most usb car chargers provide around 500ma power total which may or may not be a sticker i didn't look too close,5
6019,that allows me to plug in my gps and also charge my ipad mini with this product as opposed to using the factory apple one,5
6020,it could charge both my husband and my phones as well as my wife's purple nexus 7 case,5
6021,and that boils down to less of a problem with this but the bose has zero issues,5
6022,fits perfectly with my note 2 phone it is a tight fit to get it lined up perfectly,5
6023,the idea of being able to use my cell phone as a gps,5
6024,what i love most about the case is that it does not gather pocket lint,5
6025,got this for my mom as a gift because she had brought the galaxy also,5
6026,i've had other ones that the material is so cheap that it doesn't feel like your locking it because the plastic covers it,5
6027,i use a otter box commuter series for and i have it for about a year i upgraded to samsung galaxy note n7000 with 5,5
6028,the fit is very snug and it feels nice in the hand thanks to its rubberized coating case,5
6029,i am extremely satisfied with my purchase and i would highly recommend this product to anyone needing screen protectors,5
6030,it takes 2-3 hours to charge my samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket and my galaxy s4 batteries with the same charger,5
6031,this adapter works great and i didn't even have to use the keyboard that much,5
6032,i've had it for over a year on one of them,5
6033,just remember that you are not buying a knock off fake,5
6034,i was able to get it on the phone easier if you do it in a dust free area and save yourself a headache,5
6035,i doubt i'll use this at all but i felt it was like putting plastic covers on new furniture,5
6036,now i never used any previous models for my iphone 4 and it worked fine on a one-hour drive,5
6037,you can never have enough of these if you have a need for extra storage on the phone,5
6038,it has a rubber bottom so it won't slide around when put face down,5
6039,we have gotten several different screen protectors and these are as good if not better than the originals,5
6040,until then this is a great case if you're looking for a good matte screen protector,5
6041,this item is well made and doesn't feel like it will fall out,5
6042,from what i can tell it doesn't appear to have much front protection but i have dropped my phone a few times,5
6043,it has saved my iphone so many times and it never loses its form and ability to hold the phone perfectly,5
6044,it seems durable even though it is made out of and is not a fault with your skin,5
6045,received alot earlier than expected and for the price the sound and comfort of these babies,5
6046,my teenage son has dropped his phone dozens of times and the screen has never cracked and the phone has suffered no damage,5
6047,it is easy to set up just plug in the included mini-usb plug so those will not be compatible with these wall plugs,5
6048,i replaced my mother's cracked screen on her phone and is still able to text without issue,5
6049,this part came very quickly and was easy to move out any air bubbles,5
6050,this battery will charge my iphone 5-6 times before i have to charge it,5
6051,would buy again but i don't think it is excessive,5
6052,as i mentioned detailedinstructions were included but i did not need to enter any pin numbers to make the connection,5
6053,i don't know how long it will last but has been going strong for months,5
6054,i have used it to charge my apple ipod nano 5th gen and iphone 4 with no issues,5
6055,i will definately buy another if anything happens to the durability of the unit its actual storage capacity and so on,5
6056,that made it less than desirable for use without a case like a lot of accessories,5
6057,i've had it on for over a week now and works great,5
6058,it takes pictures like a normal cover considering that it does not block other plus for standard duplex outlet,5
6059,the material is very nice and feels good in your hand knowing it is less likely to fall out of your pocket,5
6060,1 amp to charge mylg optimus prepaid android phone virgin mobile because i do not have to find an outlet to charge my phone,5
6061,i have the spare to back me up for the rest of the typical users i think this is a very cool case,5
6062,it's a case that totally encloses the phone protecting the screen and the film before placement ultimately there will be tiny bubbles on it,5
6063,i received a complimentary sample to test for a review i am happy with the order and you will be too,5
6064,i was excited to get this dual usb car charger allows two devices to be powered charged at the same time,5
6065,depending on what headphones you have if you want to protect your investment go buy this case asap,5
6066,if you are looking for drop protection this is not the case when the buds are in the magnet pockets,5
6067,i wanted something to protect my phone while in my pocket and purse,5
6068,or it's simply being plugged into a device that is charging drawing power and blue when it is fully charged,5
6069,this is the perfect size to carry in your purse or pocket while you're out clubbing,5
6070,two things i like about the phone the phone is a very basic look which i find better,5
6071,this kensington universal windshield vent car mount is one of the most minimal flip cases i've used,5
6072,this protector is curved to fit the entire front of the note ii but that is a good thing most of the time,5
6073,whoever thought that one day you would be listening to music talking on the phone everything is very clear and bright,5
6074,highly recommend this product to everyone that needs a screen protector and i just happen to get one while wearing,5
6075,i love the graphics on the purple one i got and it doesn't look cheap and light weight comes in black and white,5
6076,it came in pretty fast and it is easy on the eyes and easy to find in my laptop bag even on a dark plane,5
6077,fits the phone great gives it a nice grip and feel in your hand,5
6078,i am constantly losing my stylus so this was a great deal and does the job as described,5
6079,i spritzed the screensaver with spray that came with it as well as an iphone 5 and both charged with no not charging messages,5
6080,i receive on time i love the product it was a good price,5
6081,overall this is a great portable charger for the money and i would buy this product again and again,5
6082,it fits the phone perfectly and is a great price you will not be disappointed,5
6083,i've reviewed several portable external battery chargers and the energen 8400ma is my favorite,5
6084,because there are two separate pockets your phone is well protected once you start using uag case,5
6085,the one and only complaint i have about this particular device is it turns itself off when the device is charged,5
6086,it beeps a lot and wakes my wife i don't hear it so i don't miss it in case if i drop it,5
6087,this is a oem htc battery which is always the way to go because they're always the cheapest,5
6088,that all being said in my opinion this is a very high quality cable that works great with my lightning ported devices,5
6089,this is well crafted and has plenty of space for credit cards insurance cards and i d cards,5
6090,my samsung galaxy s3 doesn't have it but i was able to use it without an additional purchase,5
6091,the only issue is if you have a leather softcase there is a good chance they will fit with your case,5
6092,comes with all the tools needed for the job are included,5
6093,other than that they are supurve and i will continue to until this case comes apart and is no longer functional,5
6094,may very well be some restrictions in that regard but i am not going to be near a charger portable charger all the time,5
6095,altho the clock on the screensaver does not have this issue at all so you should get one of those,5
6096,the clip is sturdy and the stand is a bit flimsy but as long as it does not exceed 3,5
6097,easy to put on and a little difficult to clean due to the raised edges of the case,5
6098,i like being able to lay in bed and watch movies and when i mow the lawn,5
6099,the first time i wrote the review i was complaining about the sound and how the headset was sliding off her ear,5
6100,initially they sent me at no cost an adaptor that did not work with my iphone but this one always does,5
6101,just put on and i'm so excited to capture some traffic and sunsets,5
6102,both are great you wont be disappointed it has gotten me out of many a jam,5
6103,the light makes it easy to find in my purse and at meetings it is the only one that works well,5
6104,these cases are slim i don't care for the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers,5
6105,just make sure you test it out before leaving town and yes you can use your own favorite headphones just as easily,5
6106,several times i week i end up with a dead battery and having to charge it two-three times daily,5
6107,i bought the defender case for my iphone 4 g from att,5
6108,it will probably hold up but i'm not going to say it's a wireless charger for the nokia lumia phones,5
6109,the small plastic pin plugs right into the headphone jack and another fits into the charger jack,5
6110,i received the energizer usb charger via the amazon vine program which was a lucky thing for me,5
6111,it is pretty good at filtering noise but i don't expect this level of case to save it from a major crash fall though,5
6112,the case is a bit bulky and not pocket friendly but i don't put it under running water to make the sticky side wet,5
6113,it's very good value for a unit like this so if you're looking to protect the camera lens from smudges,5
6114,i have to be honest i have not have a problem at all looking for a host to charge my phone,5
6115,don't expect your big jambox to take the place of the over-priced official amazon charger,5
6116,i love the pause rewind ff features especially when i'm working out and rocking out to music,5
6117,they don't peel off after a month like other screen protectors do anything after using this one,5
6118,if you look closely there is a hint of sparkles on the back of the trentium case,5
6119,it is very rugged and provides good protection without making the phone too bulky and looks are better than functionality for her p,5
6120,but seriously i bought some for my note 2 iphone 5 and iphone 3gs,5
6121,has two stops for different viewing angles and can be used in either landscape or portrait view,5
6122,cons it does not line up properly with the camera flash speaker noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly,5
6123,this is exactly what i needed so i don't have to go out for wifi anymore hardly,5
6124,the immediate difference in appearance is that both of the ports are rated at 5,5
6125,i bought these for my wifes phone and she loves it,5
6126,overall it's a great buy to protect your screen and this is an affordable way ti do it,5
6127,download speed is great and i tested it with an android phone and the other to swipe my finger,5
6128,the colored finish of the hard plastic portion has a soft touch feel similar to the nexus 5's back,5
6129,this is a clear cover that is tough and durable and does not obstruct the camera lens yet protects it,5
6130,i am very pleased with quality of these screen protectors are better than most other phone cameras in terms of low-light sensitivity,5
6131,i messed up trying to put the first one on and it is very durable,5
6132,used the backup battery a few times and it has stood up to my pocket very well,5
6133,i recommend it to anyone that needs a reliable and fast charger,5
6134,even nice to fold the cover back and it still looks good easy to put on and very good in quality too,5
6135,thank you for reading this review and i hope that it will help you make a decision on which is charged first,5
6136,i'm often in the situation where i had to recharge my phone 2-3 times per day,5
6137,the port covers do not get in the way of the touch screen and decrease the sensitivity,5
6138,i'll keep this in the car in my purse when going to dr,5
6139,i have the sol with the heavy bass engine and i must say i was pleasantly surprised by this one's quality,5
6140,truthfully i don't need all the bells and whistles of the creative wp-380,5
6141,my wife and i use these to listen to her iphone in the shower,5
6142,i found it easy to remove the adapter from the tablet before inserting or removing the usb connection,5
6143,i love the fact that i didn't have to use the over-ear piece anymore,5
6144,when you put this in the holster its a little hard to get the other shell on but once it's on its snug,5
6145,fast shipping and very easy to put on and i haven't had any problems with it doesn't slip off the phone,5
6146,i absolutely love this case this fits right into the wall outlet part of the charger,5
6147,the nice thing about this charger is that it is built very solidly,5
6148,but it works great with it as it should with any micro-usb device such as the kindles which is actually all of them,5
6149,just got the product and have only had it on my phone for 2 days now and it seems to hold very well,5
6150,i bought this particular external charger because it was made by the same company i figured they will fit correctly,5
6151,quality is good plus its original samsung so it fits my note 2 with a case fits perfectly,5
6152,once you've done this you'll have to learn how to insert the phone but it does not help or degrade the call quality,5
6153,i've only been using the phone for over two months,5
6154,had another for over a year and still no problems with any of them and have had some for over a year,5
6155,i've tried an incredicharge powerbank in the past and they just don't seem to fit in alarm clock dock with case on,5
6156,looks really professional and it has a place to put your license credit cards and money,5
6157,i was also able to charge my iphone ipad and blackberry providing a reliable charging source,5
6158,these little screen protectors were just what i needed to eliminate being tethered to power,5
6159,i bought this case to replace one that was lost some time ago,5
6160,it landed right on the corner above the camera and it is really a great case not just for the money,5
6161,so much nicer than having to plug your phone in just sit it on it,5
6162,then i told them it still had power left over when i returned home,5
6163,the micro usb port is about 1 32 of an inch on every side of the phone,5
6164,figured it was ruined anyway so i used the alcohol wipe and the microfiber cloth to clean the screen before applying,5
6165,she hasn't tried charging her tablet yet so i'll just have to get over my slight ocd and ignore them,5
6166,and the 8400mah capacity allows me to charge my phone quickly even while playing pvz2,5
6167,i have bought two chargers from sprint for my htc evo and doesn't add a lot of bulk but the phones look stylish,5
6168,5 3 hours to fully recharge the yubi power battery so you want to make sure you have not missed a spot,5
6169,the case lasted for a good while but if you drop your phone and it would be in an odd position,5
6170,i ordered this product for my daughter and she really loved this case,5
6171,this causes the home button to feel recessed a bit which i don't mind since i have 3 batteries all 2gethr,5
6172,i have had this dock for about 6 months now and still no bubbling,5
6173,you don't have to worry about the glass hitting anything,5
6174,since this mount has a suction cup i was able to attach the metal to my phone case for a better grip,5
6175,they have great protection for my iphone and for watching television on my ipad,5
6176,one thing the paperwork that comes with the power supply sold with the phone,5
6177,i love the price and the protection it provides is second to none,5
6178,very nice fit and good protection for the nexus 4 phone and the phone fits snugly into the shell that slides into the belt holster,5
6179,then while my ipad was still plugged in i held the power button for a few seconds to turn it off,5
6180,so far i'm quite delighted it has exceeded my expectations therefore this is my genuine and heartfelt review,5
6181,these cheaper usb cords may not be able to fit your phone in with a case if your case is pretty thin,5
6182,this case is a compromise between protection and ease of use i can live with that though,5
6183,and i'd also like to be able to continue to read until the power comes back on,5
6184,there is still some noise in low-light situations but i'm happy to report that the icarrier 120d is my favorite,5
6185,not quite as bulky as the otter box but it's great having 5 extras in the pack just in case,5
6186,but every time i went to clean the inside of the screen protector of the otterbox,5
6187,recommended but be careful to follow the directions and if you have the need to leave your device be it phone ipad or whatever,5
6188,solid durable good quality sleek pleasing to the eye and is not too flashy,5
6189,great price also for the quality of product that it is,5
6190,stay with the 6 foot as it works well and have for quite some time now,5
6191,i don't think there is anything better for the price range that it's in now,5
6192,i received a sample of this product for an honest review which you have just read,5
6193,a solid product easy to use with a cable running to my car stereo in an black on black interior,5
6194,really nicely fits on the phone feels great in my hand the rounded corners are so soft,5
6195,if you want customized phone that allows you to control the music from the shower stall itself,5
6196,this charger and sync cable works great and i do not feel i have to worry about cracking when i sit on or drop it,5
6197,i was having a difficult time finding a case for my galaxy s4 and i loved it,5
6198,i picked this case because red is my favorite color and i purchased this when i received my iphone 5,5
6199,the 4 foot cable allows me to plug in my gps and charge my cell and bluetooth at the same time,5
6200,we've had it now for a while and i'm glad i did,5
6201,i haven't dropped it yet so i can't say how good the bass or what decibel something something is,5
6202,i will definitely be using this charger when i get to where i am going,5
6203,the 2nd one was purchased for a friend and he loves it even though it was my fault,5
6204,i switch out the colors daily love the variety of the colors so i can change and interchange colors to make my own,5
6205,charging the headset is a breeze with the included micro-usb cable to an iphone 30 pin,5
6206,i bought this cell phone for my granddaughter and she was very satisfied with it,5
6207,i can't wait to use it on my ipad and one on my phone,5
6208,i do like the blue light on top of the end of the cover to charge it,5
6209,i wanted to get a bluetooth so i can listen to mp3 use navigation etc etc,5
6210,if you have a barely there case or no case on it it will work for many of my future devices to come,5
6211,these cable did the job but it would be nice if there was some texture to it so it provides both scratch and shock protection,5
6212,after washing my head phones in my shirt pocket i ordered a new set of batteries and it did the trick,5
6213,the charging headphone port covers are sturdy enough to last a good while as long as you don't leave large air bubbles,5
6214,it is a great case if you are willing to deal with a somewhat larger device to get that,5
6215,ordered two of these for my note 2,5
6216,my third poetic case for samsung galaxy note 2 android phone,5
6217,was a christmas gift for my fianc eacute along with the iphone 5 works in the 2nd port very well without any issues,5
6218,i havent had no issues so far it works great and it chagres as fast as the one that came with the phone,5
6219,i am very impressed with the quality of the photos i've taken but i don't use ever after 2 months,5
6220,i think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important factor in my purchase of this case and it holds up great,5
6221,it's super easy to put my phone in my pocket and it looks good,5
6222,i purchased the product from the friendly swede because it was cheaper and i thought there could not be much difference,5
6223,it's been a while since i last replaced one of these but i will say that so far i'm very pleased,5
6224,it does serve its purpose and i no longer have to deal with my phone running out of battery,5
6225,although it is two color it is a solid case and i always get great feedback from people who see it,5
6226,this is the second one of these cases for my next phone,5
6227,i purchased this for my friend and she loves it with 3 kids she feels fancy,5
6228,but when i tried again in my phone it was a bit difficult to apply and attracts finger oil like a magnet,5
6229,i don't even mind that it makes the phone heavier and thicker but the protection it gives your phone is also great,5
6230,i snorkeled for about an hour and it seems to be holding up very well on his phone and its great protection,5
6231,this case has a rugged ribbed rubber cover that is easy to apply and see through and is smooth to my finger swipe,5
6232,i really really like the way this one is side to side instead of top to bottom i worked perfectly,5
6233,their hd stuff is better than the original one simply because it came out of the packaging and it is very strong and reliable,5
6234,these fit perfectly and unlike other protectors i've purchased for my galaxy s4,5
6235,it holds the phone very securely and i dont have to worry about my phone getting damaged,5
6236,on the back there is a button that you have to press in a slight angle,5
6237,now this protects her phone so i don't have to carry a purse to for a quick errand,5
6238,i bought it before i bought the phone because i don't use them,5
6239,they look very nice on the phone and feels good in my hand,5
6240,i have gotten so many complements that i'm still using it and will continue to use these in the future,5
6241,it's an excellent phone and i highly reccomend it to anyone who wants an awesome phone,5
6242,the matte finish is very nice and it is easy to rotate when you need it horizontal or vertical,5
6243,has a great grip all the way around it should take a hard hit,5
6244,it has a push button release and comes with a handy good quality pouch that holds the battery and cables,5
6245,i wasn't sure when i ordered this case i was leery of getting it because of the price and the positive reviews,5
6246,they are also great for working out since they are hands free i can talk and work or listen to my music,5
6247,i am happy with my purchase and i will be getting one for my daughter and her iphone,5
6248,i initially thought the pad was just so-so but decent enough for general use,5
6249,it also makes the phone easier to pick up and hold,5
6250,most people can't even tell there's a screen protector on my kf that seems a little thicker than normal,5
6251,i would suggest this case for anyone with an iphone come on don't lie,5
6252,amazing color and works great a lot better than other ones i have that give the same output,5
6253,so approximately 4 months ago i was due for an upgrade so i figured i would try their portable battery out,5
6254,this phone is locked to t-mobile and immediately looked up fosmon cases,5
6255,this lasted forever on my son's phone which is missing the back,5
6256,75 x3 x1 yes it will fit in a pocket but protects it in case you drop it,5
6257,i bought 2 for my wife's and kid's phones,5
6258,the 6 feet in length is so convenient and it fits in my hand just right,5
6259,however i have to admit that i'm not easy on it either,5
6260,the inside of the case where the back of the phone clearly,5
6261,easily sticks to window i live in arizona and even though it isn't as bright as the pic must be the lighting,5
6262,you recharge the battery from a wall charger that only has one port,5
6263,i even wear it when running and working out at the gym or taking phone calls while cooking dinner,5
6264,i looks so cute and fits my phone very snug and protected it very well,5
6265,it connects easily to my galaxy note 3 to help me sleep,5
6266,i bought the holster for it so i don't miss the keyboard at all,5
6267,for the record i plan to buy a second one for that other just in case moment,5
6268,25 w will fit most sunglasses or reading glasses and the micro-fiber cloth before you attempt to install it,5
6269,i was a bit worried that since it doesn't cover up an adjacent outlet on the strip,5
6270,of course it adds thickness but it does it in a way that looks more like a museum display than a regular consumer product,5
6271,this has much better fidelity than the built in speakers and don't want to pay the hefty cost associated with it,5
6272,little disappointed when i discovered that while trying to charge my phone along with my wife's ipad who was watching movies,5
6273,i've been very happy with the purchase and love the price,5
6274,it did not take my phone a lot of time to find the best prices on merchandise,5
6275,it takes a licking and keeps on ticking this is a must have for anyone with an iphone 4,5
6276,1 amp is black on black and very hard to see in anything other than ideal lighting conditions,5
6277,the four buttons are logically organized and very intuitive the power button at the top of the line and was not impressed,5
6278,this case replaces the back cover and only offers protection for the back and sides of the phone,5
6279,nevertheless i still feel that it is a good phone even for today,5
6280,the cards stay in really well and do not fall out when i run or exercise,5
6281,in short the product works and does what it is expected to do and is well thought-out,5
6282,since the end of october i only have had a couple of hiccupps if i switch on the bluetooth,5
6283,amazing how it stays in place on the phone better,5
6284,the button cover at the bottom is even thinner and you can still use the ipad or phone with relative ease,5
6285,it then picked up the right audio and the sound quality is actually not bad at all,5
6286,i love that its thin and still fits in my arm band with the case on if i was about to go running,5
6287,ive had the case for 2 months now and you dont even notice because the case comes up and around,5
6288,now with those two things out of the way you are asking so what's the caveat,5
6289,the case is a bit slippery but nowhere near as slippery as the phone it's self and it has that matte black,5
6290,of course it's always best to use your phone's usb cable to the usb on the battery,5
6291,ever so slightly matted to make the phone less slippery and therefore less likely to drop,5
6292,just wish it came with more than 75 % charge remaining,5
6293,i really like that you can keep the cover over the phone so you can set it screen down with no worries,5
6294,and yes i highly recommend this product and thus i rate it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars,5
6295,i 8217 m happy with it and would recommend it to other potential buyers,5
6296,and the belt clip is probably my favorite part about the headset is how comfortable it is,5
6297,5 the case only protects the back and sides of the phone,5
6298,my only issue is that the new back is much harder to remove than the original but thats a good thing or not,5
6299,i've had this screen protector on the quality of the product,5
6300,both my partner and i purchased this product for a family member and it has been a conversation piece,5
6301,comes with a string so you can put it on forwards or backwards,5
6302,it looks pretty and the feels the same as the original battery that came in your phone,5
6303,this case fits the droid x2 perfectly no need to spend extra money for specialty wall chargers for my other devices,5
6304,the back of the case and i think it will be just fine,5
6305,it fit everything i needed plus my phone without having to fiddle with them and get them in the right position,5
6306,i'm pleased to report that there is no difference in how it works,5
6307,it is a very good case it's realy protect the phone from scratches in pockets and minor bumps or drops,5
6308,some people say it leaves a gap between the battery cover and the flap is basically built into the case's battery cover,5
6309,works just as well as the oem apple cable as far as i can tell it charges everything at full speed,5
6310,well the original lasted well and i put it through 2 charge and discharge cycles before it starts lasting the entire day,5
6311,all in all this is a great case for the phone,5
6312,you have to have the headset plugged in at the same time that they would be recognized and charged,5
6313,it is still as quick as if you don't have kids grabbing your phone and tossing out across the room,5
6314,bought these to replace broken cables for my wife and daughter they can't seem to keep their phones charged,5
6315,i have it split so that it can charge your phone or computer in their socket,5
6316,he's been getting lots of compliments and the case protects the sides and the screen so this is something that is unavoidable,5
6317,this is an attractive well-made case that snaps tightly over the top of my phone perfect,5
6318,the sound quality is excellent and the sound is really good,5
6319,having this in your carry-on luggage is a lot easier than looking at the printing on the case,5
6320,i bought this screen protector and it doesn't inhibit anything,5
6321,a perfect fit for my iphone 5s and provides a full charge in about 1 hour and 45 minutes,5
6322,the mytouch 4 g had 35 % battery charge when i started charging it with the icarrier 8217s 2,5
6323,it's a little tricky to be putting it in and out of back jeans pocket isn't a problem,5
6324,it has a blue light indicator to check how much power is left in the numerical lcd screen,5
6325,after my son drained the anker he went to charge it and then four solid circles once charged,5
6326,if you have installed screen protectors on any phone i've owned so far iphone samsung smartphones etc,5
6327,i love my s3 and this case has kept my daughters phone safe from hikes and pools,5
6328,the 2nd time i got the shield perfect the case didn't even seem to know that i was on a bluetooth,5
6329,it is so clear that you can't even notice it's there,5
6330,i usually turn the volume up when i use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day,5
6331,also the hard case is thin and adds protection to the phone all the way around,5
6332,once you play with this thing for a few weeks and have had no problems with reception with cingular so far,5
6333,not rubbery all if that is what you are looking for but they are also less powerful,5
6334,there are two 3 4 34 openings on the top and bottom that i thought it was made of plastic,5
6335,however these motorola ones are the best i have used and have applied,5
6336,the silver edges blend perfectly with the silver edges of the face of the phone to rest on,5
6337,i spend alot of time outdoors with the itorch i no longer worry about my phone dying on me at 4 pm,5
6338,ive droped it a few times and the screen protector has outlasted the cases,5
6339,i really liked it so when i went looking for a new stylus because the last one i purchased broke out of nowhere,5
6340,the m1100 is comfortable so if you are the kind of person who believes in you get what you pay for,5
6341,this case is actually water resistant this means that if it's laying partially off a table it's not a weeble,5
6342,i'm a pretty rough user so i think these things will hold up against sweat over a long period of time,5
6343,for some time i was looking for a simple case that is much better than the motorola triumph,5
6344,so let 8217s say your charging your phone but you also want to protect it because it cost you all this money,5
6345,now the phones can go all day without having to be plugged into a wall or into your computer,5
6346,i hate this i have to figure out how to work it though,5
6347,i can close the case while talking on the phone and press it to my right ear without having to remove my bluetooth,5
6348,the volume controls are easily accessible and the case doesn't have a scratch on it,5
6349,sound quality is great and the price is very reasonable and the shipping was very fast,5
6350,havent dropped it yet but it seems like it would protect the phone incase of falls,5
6351,yeah it may not have a built in screen protector that does not reduce the touch sensitivity,5
6352,seller immediately took corrective action and sent me a replacement that has worked perfectly since,5
6353,it is beautiful and very comfortable on my ear and inside the ear and i could wear it for quite a long time,5
6354,it works as well as the first one did and upon plugging it into my phone and charged it for a while,5
6355,for those not using that if you were to drop this from a reasonable distance nothing more,5
6356,despite my quibbles i think these headphones are an excellent choice if you don't mind about the cord,5
6357,it also usually takes couple tries and wastes to get a good one you need to fork out some cash,5
6358,have nothing but good things to say about this company or their products,5
6359,i've gotten so many compliments on this case as i have no intention of doing anything that extreme,5
6360,i got it today and was very excited to use it since it can be used on many samsung phones,5
6361,i have tried many other brands of screen protectors in the past,5
6362,i have dropped my phone multiple times and it has protected the phone from a couple of accidental drops,5
6363,i think you should buy it it works great for them very happy that they're happy,5
6364,this 1 accessory does exactly what it is designed to do,5
6365,great price for a replacement battery for my mytouch 4 g,5
6366,i love this charger works great i opened apps while it's charging and has a steady line when it is fully charged or not,5
6367,the protector is really clear and was super easy to apply and came with directions,5
6368,it's comprable to the otterbox commuterotterbox commuter series case for iphone 5 5s fits my 5s perfectly,5
6369,i like to keep my phone for a few months now,5
6370,it was a lot cheaper than going to the sprint store,5
6371,i was determined to find the best screen protector that i have used that setting it wasn't a hassle,5
6372,if you are looking for a belt clip holster that will work with it,5
6373,loved these so much just what i was looking for to help spice up my white phone,5
6374,the case uses the smaller usb connector which charges both the phone and the case lost it's clear appearance on the back,5
6375,i have own two other cases this one is a keeper solid construction good terminals months later no issues,5
6376,hated not being able to use it with usb storage devices,5
6377,quality of construction is very good and there's no problem sliding it in or out,5
6378,consistent 3 bars or better the mp doesn't really seem to make a difference to my iphone which port it charged from,5
6379,the design allows charging the phone while in a horizontal position,5
6380,for someone who uses the headset a lot this is a must-have forany apple device owner,5
6381,the only partly negative is that it uses a standard power cable that is readily available at plenty of brick and mortars,5
6382,it works nicely the iphone plug sometimes is a little struggle to get the case off but that's what i wanted,5
6383,phone takes up to 3 hours to fully charge and longer if plugged into a computer port,5
6384,they worked fine on my 64gig ipad mini and my iphone 5s and everything is good to go,5
6385,this phone is awesome and i just love the idea of the translucent glow bumper case,5
6386,so you may plug in both a smart phone and a camera there has ever been,5
6387,pairing it with my ipad was just as simple and the same can be said about the speaker and camera flash holes on the back,5
6388,the protector is protected by the front and back layers for ease of installation and fit i will stick with the 5 star review,5
6389,satisfied with the shipping and purchase and i would recommend or be happy to give as a gift,5
6390,shows remaining battery level by pressing the power button twice turns the lamp on,5
6391,this is by far the best headset i've ever tried and it's inexpensive,5
6392,after realizing the problem was too much to fix they gave me a new one which so far is perfect,5
6393,would recommned this product to all of my friends and family loves this product,5
6394,i'm not completely positive but it appears that this is a very inexpensive leather cover that does the job,5
6395,this fit my phone perfect and it was everything i had been looking for the perfect case for his note 2,5
6396,i have used the hands-free calling feature and i don't really even have the words to describe it,5
6397,jabra tour bluetooth in-car speakerphone is very easy to pair and works very good,5
6398,charges note 3 from 0 to 100 % in about 90 minutes,5
6399,great charger i've been using this wall charger for all my other devices,5
6400,make sure to buy it from amazon at a great price so i am happy,5
6401,i decided to get this adapter because i already had a zagg installed so she is still using that,5
6402,it fits neatly and snugly over the phone and feels good in the hand great safety,5
6403,its a little lighter in person than the pic used to sell the case,5
6404,the cut is perfectly designed for the note 2 with no problem very easy,5
6405,used the usb cables that came with my iphone 5s,5
6406,upon seeing this in my car several of my family and friends and we all have them and they are perfect,5
6407,this is really the best charger i have found to date,5
6408,that said the phone case itself is very nice just what the description says,5
6409,we used it to charge all my devices and with great speed i would recommend this to anyone wanting a simple beautiful non bulky case,5
6410,this is a comfortable bluetooth that is simple to use but wonderful to have,5
6411,it broke during shipping and i bought one of these as well and i set it up,5
6412,the retractable stand on the case itself and it feels great in my hand,5
6413,my daughter just loves this case couldnt have picked a better case if you are prone to dropping your phone,5
6414,i love love love this for my samsung galaxy s2 from boost mobile,5
6415,the edges also wrap slightly around the front just enough to give the phone a boost very happy with this charger,5
6416,i actually wanted to use our all-in-one battery pack this will do the trick just nicely,5
6417,i don't understand why people are complaining on not being able to see my iphone screen in bright sunlight,5
6418,someone had also said that it jiggled a lot and i have had it for 3 months now and it is holding up just fine,5
6419,does not get in the way or have a great deal of confidence that my phone is protected,5
6420,i hightly recommend this case to anyone looking for a quality prepaid phone,5
6421,note however that on the back of the cover made it impossible to get the phone out and all ports line up perfectly,5
6422,i don't know what to say here other than this case is a perfect fit for my bb 9900,5
6423,i love everything about this case only thing it that the phone is unable to install spanish language,5
6424,it is very slim adding mere millimeters to the dimensions of the phone but it is worth it,5
6425,i purchased two one for my sis iphone 4 and my iphone 5 and nexus 5 both fit well,5
6426,difficult to remove from the power source because of the small size and durability of the cable as mentioned in the reviews,5
6427,its held up to weeks of use and it gives the phone a little defense against moisture and the all evil pocket lent,5
6428,7 strong i've dropped it a few times and this case has kept it in tact thank goodness,5
6429,be careful that you don't use the card holder,5
6430,i also really like the retractable stand just be gentle with it and it'll serve its purpose well,5
6431,i have compared their usable life to the ones that come with the product so i just use my original usb cables no problem,5
6432,it's not much more difficult with the case on and no damage occured to the case or phone,5
6433,the only minor complaint i have is that when the phone rings the headset will read the caller i d of the incoming call,5
6434,surfing the web tweeting reading books or just playing games on this phone is a thing i long for throughout the day,5
6435,when i went to order this case it was on back order so i had to wait 5 days,5
6436,would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a broken power button on their 4s,5
6437,when i saw the colors of the case but it works fine,5
6438,going through one or two before eventually getting it the way i want without the case being in the way,5
6439,it fits on the phone perfectly and adds just the right amount of heft,5
6440,ive seen these kinds of cases on the internet and i am going to continue to use this case as my everyday case,5
6441,its a cute case and it is super durable and has a great price point at around 15,5
6442,it actually works better than some of the ones that are more slippery,5
6443,i have used several different external battery packs and this is the smallest least bulky charger i have owned,5
6444,plus you get 3 of them for 1,5
6445,let's you have a good grip on it in the first place however i can't stand standard screen protectors anymore,5
6446,i was doubtful because it was so small he loved it,5
6447,update 7 8 2014 i've had this case for 5 months now and i'm still at 32 %,5
6448,nice fit but a little on the pricey side but not bad for a high quality versatile charger,5
6449,they provide 2 in the package which is fortuitous as invariably i mess up the first because i allowed lint under it,5
6450,i finally bought my first smart phone and i love it,5
6451,5 mm headset so you can substitute your own preferred headset to be plugged into a usb port and windows xp detected it without issue,5
6452,great price and the product is pretty good quality but not as good as stock iphone changer,5
6453,i highly recommend it to anyone looking for the best smartphone experience htc offers,5
6454,after having a lot of different cases being a guy when i go out i turn it on otherwise it stays off,5
6455,bought this one for my wife and she really likes it,5
6456,great product quality definitily lepow is one of the best cases i've ever bought for my phone,5
6457,snug fit nice case for the money this was the best,5
6458,it works well is a great charger and probably the only one that comes with a factory warranty,5
6459,screen cover is not included then again i've never used a cover like this one for it,5
6460,i like it because it does not increase the size and weight of a single aa battery flashlight,5
6461,i can use mys pen without marring the screen protector and it does what it says it does,5
6462,with a decent amount of bass considering how small it is about the size of a tube of chapstick,5
6463,the elevation along edge protects the screen from coming into contact when the deveice is laid flat,5
6464,i love this now this is the best smart phone that i have owned,5
6465,the bendy has built-in versatility and can be used to power any device such as a lighten wire for my iphone5,5
6466,i'll probably never use the itorch to charge my phone because the connectors are at the back,5
6467,i've dropped the phone a few times and this case protected it to the hilt,5
6468,i love this thing and i would definitely buy this case again,5
6469,however meantime this case and screen protector will hold up very well in the environment that i work in,5
6470,0amps charging but compared to the other case i've been using this 600 for several months now and have not regreted it at all,5
6471,if you do have experience you can save a lot of dollars and you get the same level of quality,5
6472,can't wait to give this as a gift the adapter works perfectly and the price is great,5
6473,true to its name it is very slim and easily slides in and out of pocket easily with this case,5
6474,all in all i'm impressed with the case and i like the bold orange plastic contrasting the black rubber,5
6475,it works well with both my iphone and samsung galaxy phones,5
6476,it's very loud at its highest volume setting and i have no trouble with distortion or anything like that,5
6477,it may be expensive but to me it's perfect not big at all,5
6478,the units are a bit heavy but what do you expect by expanding you capacity to double the oem battery,5
6479,i set up my ipad and a youtube video on how to properly replace the glass without damaging it,5
6480,this does work just fine and i like the slim look of this case battery charger,5
6481,i am so rough with my phone and these did the job very well,5
6482,it looks great and fits the phone with a tpu cover on it,5
6483,considering it is 10000mah of power the size and weight are perfect for transport in a backpack,5
6484,you need to finesse it a little to get it in but i couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase,5
6485,definitely protects and feels good in the hand and it fits the phone just fine and it offers great protection for your phone,5
6486,ordered this for the color or course and loved the little sparkles in it but didn't realize it was for an extended battery,5
6487,words of cautionpull both sides of the cord out at the same time otherwise the cord will hang up inside the casing,5
6488,both my partner and i purchased this product for work along with the icarrier,5
6489,so far i have had for about a month now and item seems very sturdy,5
6490,i really like that it's a little sticky on the dash but maybe i put in on wrong otherwise brilliant,5
6491,it was fast and simple to pair this with my samsung galaxy rush a phone with a 1750mah battery running android 4,5
6492,i've used this headset for some time now and have been very satisfied with its performance,5
6493,the products are exactly as described and it is easy to take along and store in my ipad carrying case,5
6494,due to the size of the phone i find that i have to constantly adjust it,5
6495,i recommend this product and their company i will continue to purchase these cases for my phones,5
6496,i'm having to be more prepared because it's a little more discrete and easier to roll up,5
6497,it came in two days and is a very durable screen protector,5
6498,the case looks great fits the phone like a charm and looks good doing it lol,5
6499,it's tiny and does what it says it does love it i am going to get a good case without adding to much bulkiness,5
6500,also the charger is a snug fit but it isn't so different that it looks bad,5
6501,i previously bought a diztronic tpu case for my lg optimus g and htc one to fit perfectly inside stayed around my arm,5
6502,my husband thinks it charges faster than the ones that came with my torch,5
6503,most of the negative reviews on these r ridiculous they are worth the price and have the best reviews out of many others,5
6504,they charge all of the phones we have and both the base and the back of the phone is slightly raised to provide better grip,5
6505,if you just want to dress up your phone this is perfect,5
6506,however i do not think it will hold up nicely no matter what use it is put to,5
6507,i have used this case to protect my nokia lumia 920 and it fit the phone perfectly,5
6508,this is when i had the next revelation that i had them on they're really that comfortable,5
6509,not only was this protector extremely easy to apply but the air bubbles are hard to get out,5
6510,they fit very well got 3 for the price of 1 is a great value,5
6511,the phone fits easily into the case phone is reasonably easy to put in and take out i've had it in all day,5
6512,plus you don't need to be replaced every few months because of scratches,5
6513,it fits in any electrical outlets and is very handy when you are charging an additional battery,5
6514,i am now able to charge my phone the entire ride,5
6515,definitely i will try it to see how good it is when your using the gps-map app,5
6516,battery life is very important to me and it's the best,5
6517,i like how the case protects all the edges and still shows the beauty of the iphone with some added protection,5
6518,i've been listening to audiobooks more than music so the sound quality isn't as good as the iphone4 but its definitely reasonable,5
6519,after my jawbone sorry i don't remember the brand of screen protectors i've tried they don't scratch easily,5
6520,for the money it is simply the best product out there,5
6521,i purchased this when i received my iphone 5 i knew i wanted a bluetooth speaker,5
6522,i just used the ac charger that came with the phone and hold it securely in place,5
6523,ok before i get started i just want to say this low cost bluetooth headset is a great buy,5
6524,carefull though i ordered 2 times and the second time i held the phone in place even when i hit my alarm in the mornings,5
6525,i found the case to be comfortable to hold without changing the overall look of the phone unchanged,5
6526,the only thing i wish that it had the capabilities to listen to music but for conference calls when i am working from home,5
6527,odd english aside this is a great little device that does everything i wanted,5
6528,i love this case it fits perfectly and it was semi easy to install,5
6529,as far as negatives go the biggest thing is that the yubi i got was able to charge two cell phones very quickly,5
6530,i purchased this case because it is so smooth and sleek and easy to assemble and disassemble,5
6531,one thing i like about these is the fact they actually stay in my ear any better than my other headphones,5
6532,either way i'll probably end up buying a couple more just to have,5
6533,i've used it while traveling to charge my ipad iphone and android and dont have to worry about charging it the whole day,5
6534,the only thing that i don't care for the fm radio,5
6535,i would recommend this case it is a little bulky but it is worth it,5
6536,i bought this 3-pack as a replacement for the original charger for the atrix 4 g,5
6537,i probably should not have done that but so far i've had no issued with it at all,5
6538,i bought this originally for a google nexus and it didn't work at all for my ears,5
6539,that unit recently failed so i replaced it with this kit and now it's good as new,5
6540,this is a unique item have especially if you are looking for a quality universal vehicle mount,5
6541,it is also easy to take off if you know how to install this screen you shouldn't have any issues keeping a good signal,5
6542,not a problem with the charger after several charges of snapping off the end of the pen and inserting a newimp62r pen refill,5
6543,several times i have had it in my bag for emergencies,5
6544,it did not even came with the ac adapter and usb charging syncing cable,5
6545,my gps recently died so i decided to use it with my phone ipod and gps,5
6546,it adds less than 2 mm to the thickness of the ayl cable this isn't an issue,5
6547,the fit is perfect all the holes line up perfectly but you don't see it on the main screen,5
6548,well it does come preloaded with apps that you can't get a better case for the money,5
6549,it still seems too good to be true and i still don't have quite the same level of responsiveness as if they were uncovered,5
6550,i love how there's a built-in light and charge indicators,5
6551,i really like that it covers the whole screen and it is already cut for the buttons and camera on my phone,5
6552,i have always a good grip will not slip from your hands and at the same time you are using it,5
6553,this case is also very sleek it does not add a lot of bulk to this phone because it's already so big,5
6554,so far it has protected my phone from many drops when i first purchased my phone,5
6555,it offers three options for charging so that you can get the phone screen really clean using reflections as your guide,5
6556,i purchased this for my son in law,5
6557,i ordered this unit as a replacement and it works just as good as the full protection cases and for a lot cheaper,5
6558,i have several different cases and this one is perfect i like the circle design on the back of the phone,5
6559,i have had the nt70 t for a little over a 1 can't beat that,5
6560,i still give it 5 stars but i can't really complain considering it's only 25,5
6561,use it to charge my samsung galaxy s4 and my sony experia tablet,5
6562,note i have juice defender ultimate installed in my phone and it charge's great and keep's the charge,5
6563,i'm on my second otterbox defender case for my note 2 and now use this uag as my daily driver,5
6564,it works perfectly i do not know what happened because it was sitting on my desk and it is great as the cord is short,5
6565,i chose this battery for the price a lot cheaper than a warranty coverage and much less hassle,5
6566,i always had this on my phone for a few days and it was available,5
6567,if you prefer tiny light devices then maybe this isn't for you but if you want protection for your phone,5
6568,this is an overall excellent charger for the price and i would absolutely buy another one,5
6569,the shape of the ear pieces does draw a bit more attention to the details of a product and not just the picture,5
6570,i am not saying the magicbox has the sound quality of a single battery powered rechargeable bluetooth speaker,5
6571,i went through a couple cases before i found this one which beat out my other cases,5
6572,of course i don't plan on dropping my phone but this case is so thin that it's hardly noticeable,5
6573,the fixed cable is coiled the first coiled cable that i've seen on a phone but again it's only 5mp,5
6574,although the back of the case showing the apple symbol with a screen protector there is no color pixal effects,5
6575,i have had it only for a couple of days it was also delivered to my door,5
6576,cradle is simple to use and at 15 a month is a much better value than higher-priced competitors products,5
6577,ok it worked great on the cruise but i've found i can reasonably expect about two full iphone charges less for ipads,5
6578,there's no bezel protection though so if you're worried about having your phone rolling around in your purse unprotected,5
6579,the 34 naked 34 phone in one hand and talking with the other hand,5
6580,it might absorb the energy of a drop onto a hard surface which i was very happy with the results,5
6581,for the price weight and benefits this is the best package deal that i have ever seen,5
6582,i love how the connectors stay hidden inside until you need to use them with a spanking-new samsung galaxy s4,5
6583,i have not yet used them for more than a year still works like a charm,5
6584,the 34 ribbing 34 on the back of the case has a very slim profile but provides good protection for scratches on the case,5
6585,amazing unbelieve for my cell phones it's the best screen protector you can ever invest your money in,5
6586,this is a great case to have for any iphone 4s,5
6587,it had everything in it that you need to get separately from the prepaid carrier of your choice,5
6588,9 at least twice plus my iphone 4s three times before the power bank needs to be recharged,5
6589,i like it for the holidays as it has a little 34 bling 34 to their phone while protecting it without spending too much,5
6590,good news the voyager legend is even better than the almost-perfect predecessor,5
6591,the basic specs are on the side of the cover from my blue jeans,5
6592,i love the color and i have dropped the phone already and no worries,5
6593,overall i gave this product 5 stars because it was packaged nicely and fit exactly perfectly,5
6594,to answer a call just press the on off button for 4 seconds to start charging which i think it's too long,5
6595,since it has a built-in kickstand a shell to protect your phone and they really don't,5
6596,i was able to use scotch tape to get it off it was a tuff case to get off,5
6597,the main drawback of this case is that after a month or so and couldn't be happier,5
6598,i use it around the house when i want to charge my phone because the charging port is not big enough,5
6599,i get a lot of compliments and works well with my car and head set,5
6600,i'm anxious to use it when i go swimming and when i shower,5
6601,the only thing is that if you're looking for a good phone holder,5
6602,the build is high quality and the price is just great,5
6603,i still use my sg3 so i can not comment on that aspect of the case,5
6604,i purchased this case for my cell phone i'm not very good at doing that,5
6605,i want the screen cleaner it comes with and i use it primarily while riding my bike to listen to podcasts,5
6606,the protector edges line up nicely with the side of the case is a rubber shell,5
6607,if they can reduce the size of it it is easy to find,5
6608,i use it all the time and it's very forgiving,5
6609,it is flawless and does everything i want it to do and that is to design better charge remaining indicators,5
6610,for an emergency then this is a good phone case for my samsung galaxy s5 and i don't regret one minute buying it,5
6611,form is tight and all the cut outs are perfect and it's at a great angle to see who's calling,5
6612,although i personally do not need the applicators i can see where it might stick in a tight pocket,5
6613,probably a bit too heavy to carry in a pocket or purse for places where a bluetooth headset is not appropriate,5
6614,it protects the phone as promised and the price cant be beat and the protection is top notch,5
6615,first let me disclose that i received this unit free in exchange for a review,5
6616,my only regret that i have with this product is that you can charge multiple low power devices at once,5
6617,the design of the speaker is very clean and simple with two complementing colors of silver and orange,5
6618,if you don't have it in your pocket you just wouldn't likely forget it was there,5
6619,this is my fourth cruzerlite case and they seem to have better offerings than otterbox these days,5
6620,i bought 2 of these and use them on ipad latest ipad mini iphone 4 and iphone 5s,5
6621,the 3200mah power bank charged my ipod touch 4 g at the same time,5
6622,the sound quality is good and i like that i can use it with out a cover,5
6623,it is super slim so slim you almost don't notice it but protects it from scratches,5
6624,my palm had the safari browser and i will say i am very happy with this product,5
6625,it is not the most important feature it is very sleek looking and designed to fit nicely on your visor,5
6626,i have owned this for about 2 years now and it still works as if its brand new,5
6627,you can adjust the bracing on it to move out of the way stretching over the bulkier charger,5
6628,but once you put the seidio tpu case over it you won't notice and can run all the same apps at comparable efficiency,5
6629,it fits my phone perfectly and i am able to get through the day,5
6630,the flip cover has perfect 2 mm wide slit cut-outs for the volume control mute camera speakers etc,5
6631,the case also fits really securely it's not going to protect your phone from most other things,5
6632,i would also recommend this to my friends who love starbucks,5
6633,first off the small size is great to attach to your case bag giving easy access to is,5
6634,there is a hole at the top of the list and go for it,5
6635,i have 3 of these chargers they work great with my samsung galaxy mega on metropcs,5
6636,the cable is a bit more slippery it's so much more convenient and classy than having cords laying all over the counter at home,5
6637,1 mm thin case provides scratch protection without adding much bulk to the phone and the gps,5
6638,the very first time i put it on and didn't even flinch,5
6639,it also acts as a battery pack you can charge your phone and your tablet covered with one charger,5
6640,i particularly like the covers over the buttons are a little small for chubby fingers but they work just fine and the price was amazing,5
6641,there is no interference with the accuracy of the listing of this item,5
6642,with this adjustable and rubberized stand i don't have to worry about it getting scratched up,5
6643,i was able to listen to music and answer phone calls,5
6644,for the type of outdoor tough jobs activities i do on a daily basis this product was provided for review by oxa,5
6645,i think it having the buttons makes it easier to push the home circle to access the home screen,5
6646,i purchased these 12 screen protectors b c of the price and i was very surprise for the result,5
6647,i also received this case 2 days early which is a definite plus and i end to be hard on these cables,5
6648,yes i would recommend this product to all of my customers,5
6649,i'll never have to worry about running out of juice i love it fast delivery,5
6650,and the portable charger is capable of charging an iphone 1 1 2 times,5
6651,as such i was frequently putting the phone in and out of the conversation from either end,5
6652,so far i have not had any problems with it and nfc works too,5
6653,the tekkeon has a standard usb-a connector on one end and a very bright flashlight on the other end,5
6654,it does rise up a bit but nothing to worry about,5
6655,what more can i say other than it's easy to get it in and out of the case,5
6656,everyone who sees it loves it and i really like it a lot,5
6657,with that being said let me admit that i like to change things up every so often i am thrilled,5
6658,i'm really glad i didn't purchase a couple of them,5
6659,my smart phone drains the battery very fast and this product is just excellent,5
6660,i highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a heavy duty case at an affordable price point,5
6661,other than that i'd highly recommend this for the solid construction as well as the length,5
6662,this phone is only usable on t-mobile and voice was very clear,5
6663,this case is definitely hard to get on but most of these things feel like they're built from somewhat flimsy material,5
6664,this essentially means that you have to leave your phone plugged in and charging the entire time,5
6665,fits my phone very well and looks good while doing it,5
6666,it might not work for every cell phone out there plus some spare power if needed,5
6667,has a very small lip over the screen to keep it from touching anything you lay it on,5
6668,now since you have to plug the usb adapter to this device if you want the phone holder to be soft,5
6669,nice hard case fits well on iphone 5 and the non-slip coating works so well,5
6670,i am currently a torch user but i've been given the opportunity to try this item and give my opion,5
6671,the main drawback of this case is that it has a clear back,5
6672,then into my phone and it seems to be quite durable and will help protect the phone from short falls,5
6673,this screen protector fits my samsung galaxy tab 2 using the top port 2,5
6674,works well and you can fold the cover back and flip the magnet over backwards and it holds the case very tightly,5
6675,i even took it to t-mobile to make sure i could charge off of it if i wanted to,5
6676,it's worked great on my htc one x and worked very well,5
6677,but unless you lay it face down the display does not touch the surface when you place it face down,5
6678,at any rate you should get at least 1 full days worth of battery life and anyone with a droid bionic should buy one,5
6679,dropped the phone once on to concrete and the case did an excellent job of charging my electronics even my tablets,5
6680,in fact all of the ports on the front of my nexus 4,5
6681,one cradle fits pretty much any phone with or without cases,5
6682,if your looking for a slim but yet durable case for your 3 g or 3gs iphone,5
6683,make sure you keep the attachments to use with or without a case i have tried using this holder both ways,5
6684,what a nice tight cover if i have to make a conscious effort to hit the button,5
6685,on a scale of 1 to 5 i give it a 5 due to price quality and the fact that it doesn't come off,5
6686,i believe i did this already once remember saying they are hard to get off once it's on there,5
6687,the wind was so loud that i could barely hear myself talk but my brother was totally unaware of the noise,5
6688,this case is a great choice if you want to put one of these protectors on it from day one,5
6689,even at full usage of my phone it would not turn back on by pushing reset or the power button,5
6690,it's also maybe 1 4 of a charge so it may not be the best fit,5
6691,5 hours and my phone is back up to full power and then it's ready to go,5
6692,this case i love because the color is pretty and the quality of the internal cell phone antenna,5
6693,the other reviewers here have done a great job of holding its charge so it is very reliable,5
6694,needed a charger that would charge both my ipad and iphone 5,5
6695,the screen protector is the best i tried and has a really nice grip to it so it works for me,5
6696,it doesn't feel cheep and it will definitely not look out of place on a office desk side table or bed stand,5
6697,i myself have a 32 gb iphone 4 and i keep a lot of stylus pens on hand,5
6698,the software is user friendly very easy to get used to the slightly tacky feel but once the oils from your hands,5
6699,he also comes with his own micro usb cable but you can plug any other standard usb cables in to it,5
6700,this battery will help you through the entire day and then just charging it at night,5
6701,i'm happy with the otterbox for the iphone 4 works like a charm,5
6702,all-in-all i'm quite happy with these,5
6703,i received them before the date promised and in perfect condition,5
6704,if you are ordering this and wish to use a screen protector that goes to the edges will lift up,5
6705,i gave these 5 stars because for the price these really can't be beat for the sale price of five dollars plus change,5
6706,since i have had this for several months now and are glad we purchased it through amazon,5
6707,i bought this case for my wife who just upgraded to an iphone 5s,5
6708,first the box for the jabra motion uc is able to supports the 4,5
6709,i have no scratches on my screen but emma did a number on the charging cable yikes,5
6710,i have owned 3 cases by mophie and have had nothing but a great experience with it,5
6711,this is so damn comfortable to have it right in front of me and started playing a dolby hd surround sound test video,5
6712,the yp520a is a highly portable device it can easily be slipped into pants pocket unless you wear tight pants,5
6713,if i keep my phone in my hand so it doesn't slip out,5
6714,the battery life isn't gigantic but there's only so much fidelity you can expect from bluetooth,5
6715,it seems for now we are out of luck until you can order more,5
6716,maybe because i'm probably the last person on earth to use the tour,5
6717,the case added just a little bit of bounce to the phone in case it is dropped but the phone with the other,5
6718,that case fit well but i wanted something that would charge them quickly and efficiently,5
6719,i enjoy using the braven 600 to listen to my music or radio when i work out,5
6720,the ports are spaced far enough apart that i didn't have to keep buying new charger but just appropriate power cord,5
6721,although the charger comes almost fully charged it takes about 6-7 hours using the provided usb cable into my usb wall charger,5
6722,not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug the correct device into the correct usb,5
6723,so we won't pretend that this case is great doesn't transfer colors when in pockets,5
6724,first of all i am a veteran when it comes to having protection for your cell phone,5
6725,the galaxy 3 uses a lot more power than any other i have tried,5
6726,in conclusion i bought this stand for my iphone and was happy to see they had some nexus 5 cases,5
6727,fits very nice and even fits over a leather case i have on my phone it fits in the holster,5
6728,it is thin fits the phone perfectly and seems really sturdy,5
6729,its also great for camping and can charge two devices at once using your usb charging cables,5
6730,so much better than what i could find locally so there appears to be a break-in period for this battery,5
6731,i bought this because i have no problems with it,5
6732,there are many more colors available on amazon which is why i got it it vastly improves performance,5
6733,this is the best cover i have ever had for my samsung gs3,5
6734,instead with the jabra cruiser2 i can charge it up and 2 weeks later its still fully charged,5
6735,the one gripe i have with it it's too light,5
6736,i purchased this a few weeks ago and they arrived damaged,5
6737,also the gels on the bottom provide great grip and prevent the speaker from sliding on and or damaging a surface,5
6738,it is really lovely it is very pretty and does fit my phone very well and great grip,5
6739,i like that i can simultaneously charge this unit as well as my ipod touch tour and slacker g2,5
6740,the sound quality is excellent and it does not add bulk to the phone,5
6741,the necessary cut-outs for the camera and ear piece then a horseshoe cutout for the home button,5
6742,because of the tight fitting case it is hard to keep up with everyone's gadget's chargers,5
6743,i love the auto on off thing as well since i can never remember to plug my phone in to charge anymore,5
6744,well here we are in 2014 and what you get is the holder and two strips of command tape,5
6745,i am sooooo glad to know be able to connect my usb devices now requires you to plug in the usb cord anymore,5
6746,i would highly recommend this case for anyone looking for something that is fun to use and works well with cover with my phone,5
6747,i mostly use it through streaming via bluetooth from my iphone 5 but it is so adjustable about any phone should fit fine,5
6748,dual powering of multiple devices equals more bang for your buck than some others this size,5
6749,unlike some have used in the past and am yet to be dissapointed,5
6750,this is a fine wall adapter with a usb cable than the usb cable alone what,5
6751,operation is easy and straightforward 8211 just connect the device you want to charge if it is not a subminiature connector,5
6752,my girlfriend thinks it's definitely better than what i had and it works well and charges my device ok,5
6753,she uses it in conjunction with an ismooth cable and it does a great job sitting on the table and holding the headset while charging,5
6754,i've had it installed for several weeks now and have had no problems with it,5
6755,i've started to use the ultra power save mode the battery loses 5-15 % overnight,5
6756,mytouch is a very heavy phone so having a case that will allow me to intercept the bt commands and change what it does ie,5
6757,included in the box is a micro usb cable the power bank and a two normal usb outputs for charging your electronics,5
6758,this will charge my iphone to 100 % and my ipad from 0 to 100 % and that's it,5
6759,i recommend this device to anyone who is looking for good protection and privacy,5
6760,precision cuts allow room for the camera lens flash and speaker on the back,5
6761,i do have to say that i am very impressed with its performance,5
6762,luckily one of my other cases that i have tryied are to big,5
6763,once charged it has more than enough power to charge my device effectively unlike some chargers,5
6764,this is the best otterbox for my husband since he tried to steal my free sample,5
6765,definitely a great price for this item plus it is a great thing to lay out and then toss your phone on it,5
6766,anyway the screen of this phone is so good it's up to the computer manufacturer to support the profiles supported by various devices,5
6767,with the micro-usb end is plugged in all the way even on the brightest day,5
6768,there are other cheaper cases but this one is the best so far,5
6769,i would advise that screen protectors also be used with the case on the phone is hard to use but this was a good one,5
6770,i love how it comes equipped with everything you need to protect your phone and carry couple of cards without a need of a wallet,5
6771,kidding on the last one i would completely recommend this phone and even service from at t,5
6772,it just arrived so i haven't had it for more than a kickstand you can use it for 2 apple products as well,5
6773,it truly makes the iphone feel much more comfortable in the hand than the rubber outer covering of the defender case,5
6774,when i received the case i was delighted to see they have it in stock,5
6775,this case is lightweight and almost feels like there's nothing on the surface,5
6776,it comes partially electrically charged out of the box but looks and works great once on your ear,5
6777,i've only had this for about a year and it is still going after a week,5
6778,design i don't mind the added bulk,5
6779,this case gives my phone a unique look,5
6780,now with my glass screen protector my phone is still without the need of a computer,5
6781,it is easy to charge takes a couple of hours to fully charge each battery but that is why i bought the upgrade,5
6782,it feels good in my hand and my phone doesn't overheat inside of it,5
6783,almost every device these days has the capability to charge two devices simultaneously with this charger,5
6784,i can finally walk away from my phone at the gym and the screen cracked,5
6785,have not had a chance to see if it protects it since i just got a tablet,5
6786,the case doesn't get hot when i'm charging my phone from the same manufacture than the one we installed on hers,5
6787,but for the price i wasn't really sure how much i would use the new trent limir stylus,5
6788,it fits well and there is no protruding microphone that i always seem to have one less outlet than i need,5
6789,my only wish for this product is that it does not have a plastic screen protector built in,5
6790,exterior no buttons and a beautiful led ring to let you know how many hours of talk time are available before another recharge 5 hours,5
6791,after a minute of playing around however i was able to accomplish it and still use the same screen protector,5
6792,heavy use 3 days 5 hours have taken 83 % of the battery life based on the android battery usage breakout,5
6793,bought these for my daughter who has the iphone 5,5
6794,this thing is awesome i thought i was going to have to figure out everything based on pictures no text,5
6795,and the added bonus of a voice letting you know what mode you're turning it to,5
6796,my only issue is how do i talk on the phone with it though but that never bothered me much,5
6797,it is crazy to see scratches on the back i guess that's what comes with a bluetooth unit that's so small,5
6798,i am glad that i found these because my samsung galaxy s3 will charge on either port just fine,5
6799,a handy tool and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap case and cant afford the upper level cases,5
6800,the phone doesn't have to be an exact fit on the home button,5
6801,i found a brand i was happy enough with the first one to buy it again for my iphone 5s,5
6802,my preference is to use it on my phone but my sister's,5
6803,i'm not often low on battery life with my phone but when i put it on but not impossible,5
6804,love the way it looks the way it feels and it keeps the phone secure,5
6805,but the case fit perfectly and shows to every bit as durable as the oem cable included with my samsung phone,5
6806,i have a samsung galaxy s2 cellphone and was looking for something to charge your battery you should be satisfied with this product,5
6807,i would definitely recommend anyone who is looking to invest on there phone,5
6808,this is an adorable cable whoever came up with this idea to some how attached a camera strap to my case,5
6809,5a will work in other countries but you will need to check your device to verify when it is fully charged,5
6810,i have had cases for all my iphones going back to the 3gs and they've never disappointed me,5
6811,however i have noticed that the sound quality during calls isn't so great but i was still happy with it,5
6812,i didn't realize that this came with a screen protector included that i did not know was coming,5
6813,i needed more charger ports in my car so i purchased this charger to use with my motorola moto x phone,5
6814,i would recommend this case if you are looking to upgrade your android without extending a contract,5
6815,she didn't care it wasn't that expensive and it looked exactly as i expected,5
6816,vibrates when calls come in and a nice voice tells you how many hours you have of battery,5
6817,my wife has since used it over the past few months i have never done that anyways,5
6818,1 mah port for tablets and the other rated at a higher capacity for tablets especially ipads,5
6819,this power adapter also came with a three-foot usb cable to use with my sprint lg optimus g smart phone,5
6820,fits snugly and is easy to adjust to a wide array of photographic applications,5
6821,it is handy to have both a pen and stylus in one to carry around in your purse,5
6822,you can not beat a case like this for a long time with no issues,5
6823,case is amazing and makes my note 3 look amazing couldnt be happier,5
6824,all in all this is one of the best ones i have used,5
6825,i received this case from lowerpriceusa this is an honest review that reflects what i discovered with this unit,5
6826,the only thing you need to do is make sure you plug the usb cord into the unit,5
6827,it'd be better if it came with a protective face shield that was extremely easy to apply and it makes allowance for mistakes,5
6828,while it took a little effort to put it together but you can do it after the fact,5
6829,volume is capable to be loud enough to be used outdoors,5
6830,so i peeled it off and tried to put it on again and see if it lines up better,5
6831,really missed it while i was waiting for my new trent wall charger,5
6832,cons no wall connector to charge the device you can use with this adapter,5
6833,haven't dropped it yet but imo it would have been a longer reach if it was mounted on the windshield,5
6834,i don't have any problem putting this screen protector on she has dropped it multiple times and no dents or scratches on my phone,5
6835,a light touch turns the battery on while holding it for a few seconds plug it back in and the reconnect,5
6836,this is always great for travel and can't wait to get one of their own,5
6837,0one of the nicest designer touches of this case is the flip up covers to access the hdmi charge and headphones,5
6838,this is a screen protector that i have used that is just as fast at a home charger,5
6839,it charges quickly and the batteries seem to work just as good as the iphone and ipod touch,5
6840,ive dropped my phone so many times i'm so happy i decided on this brand and device,5
6841,they sound incredible-especially if you are using the touch screen with nothing on it,5
6842,i wish the prongs didn't bend when you put it in your ear but the over-the-head headphones,5
6843,and a way to know how much juice it has left,5
6844,can't believe the price i pay for it i don't have to fiddle with out car conveter,5
6845,i got this cover for my mom for her new iphone 5 was where to buy the new otterbox,5
6846,this case you can't even tell the screen protector is on or off,5
6847,not cool for when you want to go out or if you don't use your phone a lot,5
6848,i was lucky to get 5-6 hours out of the phone now with normal usage which is at least acceptable,5
6849,i have been using this external battery for about a week now and i love it,5
6850,this one looks more solid and is looks and feels better than the cases for 30-40 at the mall,5
6851,it works great with the samsung galaxy s2 with a thick case comfortably,5
6852,this is really what she want we have two little boys and i want a good looking case with build quality,5
6853,charging the s4 battery is not an easy task to please her when it comes to a phone,5
6854,had an otterbox commuter but ditched it for this case and i don't worry about my phone if i drop it,5
6855,i charged my blackberry z10 my au pair's iphone were simultaneously fully charged from only 10 % within 90 minutes,5
6856,but i would reccpment this case to someone who wants to purchase more extra battery,5
6857,it's kinda of hard to get on and off but does not slip off accidentally,5
6858,slim profile doesn't add any bulk to an already large phone but like the feel,5
6859,i went to the sprint store to see how much it cost it was about 50 or more,5
6860,this one had no problem at all applying the first one i tried to purchase 2 more but amazon limited me to 1,5
6861,there's nothing that i dislike about the case and there is room for cards etc,5
6862,i love this even though it isn't as bulky or expensive either,5
6863,it also feels durable but i guess we'll see how that one looks when i get it,5
6864,i love the product but it doesn't work at all on the dashboard,5
6865,for the price you absolutely can't find a better headset for performance and clarity than the m50,5
6866,as the proud owner of a spiffy new samsung galaxy s5 and i was shocked by the good deal,5
6867,sure it lacks some other functions but freedom to use your own headset or if you don't use the phone,5
6868,if you are limited on funds but want a great phone this is the one i'll be putting on my iphone 5,5
6869,these cases are my absolute favorite and i can't even charge a second phone with it,5
6870,consequently it's a real pain getting the phone in there but once in it's pretty sturdy,5
6871,i attached it my phone case to hold it in my left hand to be able to type with my right,5
6872,we played each of them and i was able to give them as stocking stuffers to others,5
6873,this is a great deal the cable is a great 3 in 1 data sync and charge cable worked great when charging her ipod,5
6874,i emailed rearth about my issue and let's just say it's large and in charge,5
6875,feels like the phone is protected very well when in this case and i pretty much never carry a bag anymore,5
6876,it provides just enough texture to make the phone easy to use while keeping it safe,5
6877,it has nice lip to protect the screen from small debris,5
6878,aside from a few tiny bubbles my own fault for not properly understanding the meaning of raspberry though,5
6879,all of the ports and buttons for controlling the iphone 5 and 5s something other companies seem hesitant to do,5
6880,no dust gathering around the home button cut out in the protector with the home button and receiver earpiece,5
6881,the rim of the case and the fact that it is even lighter thenthe slim armor cases i bought,5
6882,1a usb slot comes with its own pouch so you have a place to put all the tips and the usb cable,5
6883,before i had bought this phone i had an iphone 4 case a year back and it was good too,5
6884,the amount of charge that is promised and the length of time you can use the same wireless headset for skype and your mobile phone,5
6885,i've been using these for a while now and it is still going strong,5
6886,you can use it for charging my phone in the car or in a store,5
6887,i was afraid the little extra bulk of the hard plastic on the outside but i am glad i did,5
6888,i have tons of cases and this one is still going strong,5
6889,my only beef is the bottom part of the stand the part where you place your phone charger or headphones either,5
6890,in this case i tested it out on my ipod touch and galaxy s4,5
6891,really like this case as it does an excellent job at protecting the screen and who doesn't like lifetime warranty,5
6892,i bought the iottie one-touch mount for bicycles there was no way i was going to pay that,5
6893,this so far is the best one that i've used,5
6894,it is much lighter and fits much better than the defender series and still provides plenty of protection,5
6895,bought this for my iphone 5 and absolutely love the case would def recommended to ppl,5
6896,the lines on the back side match perfect with the phone and the case did protect it well,5
6897,i bought this charger because i got a few batteries for my nexuss galaxy nexus galaxy s2 galaxy s3,5
6898,if your biceps are any bigger this won't be the charger that quits on you 500 miles from home,5
6899,the build quality blows away the ifarady yet it still has the same great quality sound and battery life,5
6900,this is a nice little case fits my iphone 5s perfectly while providing great protection,5
6901,in good conditions and ready to use and it is a iphone enough said lol,5
6902,i love that you don't have to buy it seperatly,5
6903,phone is fine took it out of the package and are of great quality,5
6904,we still need more details on the use of the product nor does it make it seem bulkier either,5
6905,this was one item in a package for my dad's birthday and he wsa so in love with it,5
6906,i actually think this one does a better job at connectivity then the samsung own bluetooth set,5
6907,i did not mind that it was a little shorter so it didn't stick out quite so far,5
6908,at the time of the s3's release s3 is better than my iphone 3gs in very way in terms of call quality,5
6909,great replacement for my old battery that was dying out,5
6910,it lined up correctly and give you adequate materials to get rid of the stock wallpaper screens i do not want,5
6911,i had a problem placing the protector on my s4 and i loved it but this suits my physical needs much better,5
6912,this cover doesn't add much bulk to the phone while protecting it,5
6913,i have switched phones 3 times since i bought this and it was a perfect fit for his at t nokia windows 8 phone,5
6914,i regularly use my iphone 5 for listening to music when out and about and great for making phone calls,5
6915,i received this case and it was the only bag i took with me,5
6916,after about 1 week of use i've gotten use to it in a very short time,5
6917,the price and value can't be beat and the charger works fine,5
6918,so convenient and ultra-portable it's about the size of my iphone 4s maybe a little bit thicker,5
6919,this has not been my first otter box for my samsung galaxy s3 and helped grandma make dinner,5
6920,ive had it for about 6 months now and i have no complaints about the quality of the nexus one's being sold lately,5
6921,the top cover part will fold all the way around the phone without leaving any exposed areas but still slim feeling,5
6922,this padded cover is a perfect fit for my droid bionic,5
6923,i purchased this case in order to carry the phone on the belt i just carry it in my pocket,5
6924,i had it for 1 day and i'm going to be out all day i'll take all three with me,5
6925,i purchased two sets of these screen protectors and the online videos are very helpful too,5
6926,i've dropped it a few times and so far it has stayed put,5
6927,although amazon has kindly offered to compensate me i would have just given her this case honestly,5
6928,very sturdy very attractive very slim case for your iphone 5 i can't imagine you could find a better one,5
6929,it holds the phone great the cord is very sturdy and doesn't tangle a whole lot,5
6930,it really does do exactly what they say it is and it worked perfect in my phone,5
6931,i've had this for probably a year and it's still the case i use,5
6932,i wil say i dropped it a few times and the phone was unscathed,5
6933,seems very durable and allows phone to be set down on it's screen and not have to worry about locating it,5
6934,i always ask the individual how i sound because they always sound great to me despite the noise conditions where they're at,5
6935,great case protects my phone good i've dropped it twice already and it hasn't cracked yet,5
6936,but if they do i'll be sure to update my note regarding it,5
6937,i 8217ve had this cable for a couple days now and so far so good,5
6938,i also like the smooth feel of the glossy screen protector,5
6939,wires are a bit thin and the plastic shell is a bit slippery when handling with clean dry hands,5
6940,granted i've not used it for listening to music browsing the web and doing just about anything,5
6941,they say it has some sort of special coating to prevent it from getting scratched up and protects from an occasional drop,5
6942,one is an older logitech product a motorola headset as well as a couple of pin specs but i'm no electrical genius,5
6943,i bought this item because i had one for my iphone 4 and iphone 5 since it works with either cord,5
6944,for ten bucks you get a charger that plugs into the cigarette lighter is bent shaped,5
6945,it is a 2 amp charger so you can't do both,5
6946,the back of the case and i think it will last for a long time yet still nice enough to be visually appealing,5
6947,they are consistently well designed and manufactured with attention to detail,5
6948,there are three blue leds to indicate the power level left,5
6949,i tried plugging them both in at the same time and received the technocel clip later,5
6950,had to read a lot of reviews on this product so i am not going to test this and it is not a fingerprint magnet,5
6951,i've never used a cover like this one before and i was a little affraid she wouldn't love the color but she does,5
6952,if you have a standard sim from at t you can plug it into one place n leave it there,5
6953,very easy to put on and works like it should as a case,5
6954,bought for my cell phone the charger is great i have several from remnants of past palm products,5
6955,i highly recommend this charging pod keep in mind it is only barely faster than what i experienced first hand,5
6956,the unit itself is slightly larger than the apple brand one but it caused no problems,5
6957,i would suggest one step-by-step youtube instructions posted by injuredgadgets,5
6958,i have never been a watch person i don't even like to call it a phone,5
6959,it gives you light right where you need it when you are busy and drop your phone,5
6960,i like it and i think you will be pleased with the amount of coverage and protection,5
6961,believe me when i say this i mean that you can use it as a stand which is convenient for my desk at work,5
6962,second the usb ports are placed in such a way that you are able to charge it regularly,5
6963,i live in florida and i have this installed on both my iphone 5 and my ipad air,5
6964,i got this case for my daughter's phone and she loves it as well,5
6965,i am very happy with it and i will miss it a lot,5
6966,it adjusts to the maximum charging capacity of the device it's charging and adjust accordingly per device,5
6967,love the alarm settings and the dimmer switch to keep it from being too bright during nighttime driving,5
6968,i purchased an iloome recently which absolutely hammered the touch screen response and clarity is completely unaffected by the protector,5
6969,you leave your car to go into a store and physically handle the phone you plan to buy,5
6970,i put it in a bowl of rice but i doubt it will break into any major u,5
6971,but the flowers are pretty and the case is easy to take on and off,5
6972,it feels just like a regular phone case and doesn't add too much bulk and this one meets my needs,5
6973,it's sleek and stylish and helps me stay connected no matter where i am i can charge it back up,5
6974,stay in ears good and the sound is really more than i expected,5
6975,when i bought my evo at a local best buy i couldn't believe how easy it was to put on and take off,5
6976,and use your task manager to make sure they are positioned correctly before attaching them,5
6977,a bit of maneuvering and i was able to lift the protector and remove 1 4 of the bottom film,5
6978,this is the exact same charger they sell you in the verizon store for over 20 so these are a great deal,5
6979,i am very pleased and i am sure that you will enjoy it,5
6980,the pouch is also a perfect fit for the verizon iphone 4s,5
6981,also because it's magnetic i don't have to figure out where to plug them in,5
6982,ordered two of these for my husband and he love it,5
6983,it has a nice fat lip all the cutouts are perfect and it does protect the phone when dropped,5
6984,the best case you could buy for your charger but i was unable to find it in red any other place,5
6985,this one has a cut out at the bottom for the charging part that way the case can stay on,5
6986,i am however extremely happy with the size and weight i still highly recommend this case for your galaxy sii,5
6987,i may yet get a htc one though i am not too thrilled with the cable clutter in my car,5
6988,the ring tone speaker volume is louder and clearer than with just the phone by itself,5
6989,when i got a new phone so his holder didn't work so i opted to replace dock connector and problem solved,5
6990,fits well and all the cutouts are precise,5
6991,using my iphone 5 i can place the phone in my shirt i can put it in my pocket,5
6992,she keeps it in an otterbox so that isn't an issue with reliability i have no qualms about recommending this plantronics headset,5
6993,also liked that it came with screen protectors and a stylus,5
6994,durable quality will help protect your phone from a drop to cement,5
6995,i love the fact that you can replace the battery and charge it,5
6996,i think this is the best designed headset i've ever owned lives up to all the reviews and hype,5
6997,i love the feel of it it's not an issue,5
6998,its a beautiful case for my samsung galaxy note 2 while driving,5
6999,it's the second one i bought for this phone and the one i'm currently using grey,5
7000,use it for my dock for my phone since it is a black phone i mean really boost the look,5
7001,i would recommend this case if you are on a budget you will not be disappointed,5
7002,phone has been dropped a couple times and it protected the phone very well,5
7003,i got to say this is the best android phone to date,5
7004,without question iq shield makes some of the best phone cases ive found so far,5
7005,i bought two of these and the other one did take longer to get here but worth it,5
7006,after horrible experiences with motorola bluetooth devices i decided to try it out on the note 2 and see how it handles that,5
7007,i travel for a living so it is great to have them in my hands i was so happy,5
7008,i had trouble applying the screen protector and using the included squeegee to work any bubbles out,5
7009,it fits tight so don't plan on changing my s3 anytime soon,5
7010,i bought as a gift and the person was very pleased,5
7011,the leather case alone is worth the price of this screen,5
7012,and here is the one thing that i didn't expected was,5
7013,these cases are definitely worth the money as they will save you money by only replacing the tips and not the whole thing,5
7014,as has been stated in previous reviews it is larger than the apple plugs and even large enough for most generic versions,5
7015,although the anti-glare anti-fingerprint matte screen protector with lifetime replacement warranty 3-pack at t verizon,5
7016,i'm a little concerned about is that it's kind of difficult to find the exact right p,5
7017,now i know you're trying to figure out which model i needed and which color i wanted,5
7018,truly bigger is better when it's time to get a new one,5
7019,the case adds a good all around protection and it's fairly easy to apply and it works well so no complaints,5
7020,i've seen a number of portable bluetooth speakers that charge via usb and i have just one usb to wall plug in adapter,5
7021,i can see it being especially good in an emergency as it is effortless to store in my vehicle,5
7022,fit and finish is top notch and the aluminum back is super cool,5
7023,it arrived on time and beacause there are three in the package so in case you mess up,5
7024,love's it so much a friend has decided to purchase one for the iphone of my 14 year old daughter,5
7025,i would really recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a case that has a flip cover,5
7026,it's cover is very strong and will not fall come detached unintentionally,5
7027,the case could fit a little more snug but it protects my phone very well,5
7028,it doesn't snag when coming out of your pocket but not too slipperyit looks awesome,5
7029,fit phone perfect and now i have a couple of other blue tooth headsets,5
7030,i bought a lot of screen protectors ever since i could find them for the motorola xoom,5
7031,i have to say this is one of the most compact suction mounts available,5
7032,i just added this to a speck candy shell case she liked installed on her phone,5
7033,it will not fit if you have an otterbox defender you will not be able to hear calls on your phone,5
7034,i definitely recommend if you plan to use a phone case so i unscrewed the back cover of my nokia 5800,5
7035,this products works well i love the dual usb part of this charge,5
7036,so i started trimming that opening and after a few minutes of searching i came across this beauty it was love at first sight,5
7037,after receiving this case and opening it up for the first time and told everyone to try them out i was amazed,5
7038,although it is a little fuzzy i like the idea of this providing privacy when i'm in public,5
7039,he's a forklift driver and has to do a lot of customization to improve your iphone experience,5
7040,it charges my iphone exceptionally fast for a car charger definitely not low quality,5
7041,the inner rubber is flexible and pliable and absorbs a lot of shock and should last you a long time,5
7042,the at t network is fast in my area and with the exception of one time retractable ethernet they've never disappointed,5
7043,i wound up spending a week looking for a decent case with a kickstand and otterbox type protection,5
7044,i also use to charge my galaxy note 3 galaxy s3 and iphone 4 and 5's with this device with no issues whatsoever,5
7045,it actually takes a little effort to put it together but once on it protects my phone and is sleek,5
7046,i don't know what other people are doing as to why it doesn't last as long as this one,5
7047,it really does look a little crappy at first but within a few days my 19 yo confiscated it from me,5
7048,this is only true when it is being charged the light blinks slowly,5
7049,this headset is perfect for use while i'm driving i'm not watching movies while driving,5
7050,this battery fit my samsung galaxys 4 g came with a pair of foam covers,5
7051,it worked perfectly and it is a sturdy case a little difficult to get out of your pocket cases but it's not,5
7052,and it also fits really well and the sound quality is good and i have no trouble at all with scratching or smudging even,5
7053,you do not need to use my notebook usb port to charge the mobile phone,5
7054,i got one for my husband and myself without a single bubble so i know it's sturdy and hold the phone really securely,5
7055,i often have need for these so i have i keep them around the house for 9-1-1 service,5
7056,the unit also comes with two different lengths of micro-usb to usb cable and instructions inside,5
7057,i ordered two sets just incase i messed up the first one but it probably isn't a good idea,5
7058,it's such a huge competition advantage especially if you're driving like you have no brain as i had been doing,5
7059,range is a little less but not enough to be too heavy for use just not as light as a feather,5
7060,i've used the fold down part numerous times and it doesn't show any sign of discoloration,5
7061,the answer end button on the headset is a little difficult but not impossible to get the case off,5
7062,once you remove it from the packaging you can tell it's streaming audio but just barely,5
7063,thin and since it is polycarbonate it will protect the phone from minor dings and scratches as well as the gold plating on the back,5
7064,i have had this on my iphone for about a week and so far so good no complaints about it,5
7065,the screen is so amazing that it lasts and lasts and lasts easy to useall i wanted was a phone that worked,5
7066,no visible scratches and i like how it's not too bulky and the fact that it came so quickly,5
7067,you can also watch a video on how to apply it on your phone screen,5
7068,very powerful that charges my iphone at least 4 times before charging it again,5
7069,you will always have the right connector for whatever device you want to charge if it is not a subminiature connector,5
7070,this case is very cute and has held up well will not discolor,5
7071,i use it to video chat on my phone and i just love this tudia case so much,5
7072,my iphone4 rides securely on my belt when i'm out and about or anywhere and not be tethered to a charger,5
7073,this comes with a 10 inch micro usb cable to charge this unit or charge micro usb devices,5
7074,it is nice to be able to use the stylus,5
7075,the battery pack works great but you need to make sure that the case would in fact repel water or any other liquid,5
7076,i charged it over night so i don't wake up with sharp pain in the side of my head,5
7077,a simple elegant quality case for your samsung galaxy note 2 the xtremeguard screen protectors will not disappoint,5
7078,and i have been able to charge my ipad and iphone,5
7079,the range is good battery life is good i easily use it for 4-6 hours of use i am inclined to believe it,5
7080,all in all i am a big fan of otter box products i use them on my ipad and iphone,5
7081,i set it aside until i had time to charge the phone you are always using the case battery,5
7082,1a usb charger allowing charging to be fast a usb cable and an extra 30-pin tip for older ios devices,5
7083,oakley pro rokrpros great sound almost 5 hours of battery life so i learned to live with it,5
7084,few months ago i discover this one and it's almost as good as new,5
7085,it has a nice grip texture on the sides so that it is hooked in on both sides of the line,5
7086,some application tips use scotch tape to remove dust and lint from the screen protector,5
7087,i couldn't be happier with my purchase and i will definitely order from this seller again,5
7088,i wasn't impressed with the quality of the product,5
7089,i also like to listen to spotify and with being able to set my phone on my desk vertically or horizontally,5
7090,but since i can always take my tablet out of the case when i am talking on the phone or on conference calls,5
7091,one thing to be aware of is that this is a great solution for power at home or on the go,5
7092,for me this extends the phone just long enough for me to take a chance and buy these i don't regret it one bit,5
7093,i've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past it's nice to have no dangling wires,5
7094,the power button has a nice soft feel to it also,5
7095,it does take a bit of force to push the release button but i'd rather have bluetooth headphones if your going to do that,5
7096,works with slimmer cases as well and really makes the phone feel not very much larger at all,5
7097,the camera is very middle of the road but is easy to use and i love all the other accessorits that came with it,5
7098,beautiful interface takes voice commands and easy to set up they work well with my new moto droid,5
7099,personally i prefer the smooth feel that the screen protector on the front and nothing on the back with no problem,5
7100,this allows me to go days on end without having to charge my battery all the time,5
7101,i have always had pre-paid phones so i knew that if i had ever dropped my phone that it would be protected,5
7102,dust is always a problem no matter where i went there would always be some kind of lag,5
7103,i definitely recommend the product and the seller very professional,5
7104,i bought 3 sets of this item and ended up giving one to my friend and he loves this,5
7105,not the same level of protection of the otterbox cases and fits into the pocket with ease,5
7106,the sim card came before my phone so i was able to leave it within the case,5
7107,it fit fine after deciding i didn't like the attachment system they use,5
7108,conclusion overall this is a huge wall charger but it is a higher capacity 3 000mah,5
7109,it's the love of my life i take it everywhere and it has saved me multiple times,5
7110,all in all this is a great replacement for my samsung s3 i747,5
7111,i actually bought one for a friend and she totally loved it so much,5
7112,seeing as how this case is all hard plastic i am not sure how well this case would protect my phone,5
7113,it also has a good medium lip so you can lay the phone down on it's face,5
7114,i do like the fact that you can buy a battery for so cheap but i compared it to another charger i purchased,5
7115,we have owned it for months now and it is still going strong,5
7116,i was able to get them at 10 shipped prime i got one for my husband for when he is doing house construction,5
7117,the color changing text is interesting but staring at it would not be a perfect fit or finish i was completely wrong,5
7118,excellent and not as bulky as an otterbox but it does seem to charge a bit faster,5
7119,if you are looking for a great case with a great look and feel to it,5
7120,i got these ages ago but i had to come back and just say a few more words about this case,5
7121,when amazon supplies a 34 factory unlocked 34 smartphone you are getting a good quality product made by the same company,5
7122,it fits snugly and doesn't add too much thickness to the phone and protects the sides,5
7123,i give this product a 5 star because i did not have one to test it with,5
7124,i don't like having to keep an eye on the charger while your device is being charged,5
7125,i had purchased several stylus pen from a different seller and found they didn't fit his iphone 4 bumper,5
7126,my phone seems to take a lot of pictures and doing a lot of experimenting,5
7127,another advantage is that this is a pair of headphones with a slightly wider plug,5
7128,i definitely like the screen protector and it has a lifetime warranty if the product becomes damaged or defective and with free replacement,5
7129,i haven't seen too much of a difference between this and oem batteries,5
7130,i love it and it makes it so secure and comfortable to hold the phone while the other swipes,5
7131,i also want to note that it really hugs the phone and doesn't allow damage to either the case or the phone,5
7132,works great as a simple silicon case its rather protective due to the fact that their batteries are not replaceable in their phones however,5
7133,a must but if you have this phone its a must have i dont know what i do wrong with my batteries,5
7134,got this at the right time just in time for his birth day present and we are pleased,5
7135,i had it for over two months and it hasn't affected my use of the cables thus far,5
7136,i want to buy another one just so i can get a good grip on the phone,5
7137,i don't use an ipad so i don't know if these fell off the back of a card,5
7138,the stand is small and lightweight but it works great with my iphone 5,5
7139,it chargers 2 devices at once one at 2 amps for your phone and one with a connector for galaxy tablets,5
7140,little problem with the first one i bought different brand,5
7141,you just don't have that click from pressing the button so it makes it hard to use the edges of your screen protector,5
7142,i've had no issues opening up the back of the case and you don't use it very much,5
7143,like i actually thought i was going to drop it with my giant hands,5
7144,fits well for the iphone 4 and you just can't go wrong with this one,5
7145,this bamboo case is warm in the hand and doesn't slip or fall holding the signal booster,5
7146,this is reasonable to replace miswsing cabes in my car and the phone holding mechanism is well designed,5
7147,case is a little bulky but a small price to pay to protect your investment,5
7148,i don't use the phone at all and barely marked the case,5
7149,comes with 2 hd and 2 matte so you have the option of denying an incoming call as well,5
7150,i normally do not comment on packaging but it is necessary in this review,5
7151,don't hesitate to get this case i have no idea what the things it comes with are for though,5
7152,what i like the most is that it is not particularly easy to shift from vertical to horizontal,5
7153,the greatest feature however is that as long as my headset remains 6 away it remains connected,5
7154,i was reluctant to even order it because its promoted as a backup battery for my lg spectrum 2 and am very pleased,5
7155,it is light and protects it from the elements and drops,5
7156,this battery lets me use my phone all day and half the night,5
7157,there are cut-outs for the volume and lock buttons for accessibility,5
7158,the belt clip was what made me try this brand and i have been wanting to get one for quite a while,5
7159,this case is exactly what i expected and it has a nice heavy pocket clip,5
7160,that is when i use one of the usb to micro usb cable,5
7161,i never knew when it was time to upgrade a phone,5
7162,it was easy to snap on and all of the buttons and ports are cut out for ease of use,5
7163,the back of the case has a grippy texture making it easy to hold and allows access to everything,5
7164,i am a heavy business user so i can not be without a stylus so now i have them everywhere,5
7165,if you are with sprint and live in a 4 g area so i get the full benefits of 4 g,5
7166,the case feels good and the case is nice and snug,5
7167,cute add-on to my ipad and iphone same time and it is to be expected since the charger is listed at only 350mah,5
7168,just to show the size and shape of this thing is perfect for that,5
7169,although other customers have said the color isn't the same as a high end speaker it does have great sound,5
7170,which surprised me as this is the first one i truly love,5
7171,i've used it with an iphone 5s with a screen protector,5
7172,i really like it and im glad i actually got the headphones,5
7173,here are 10 reasons i love this battery and can not find one complaint,5
7174,sometimes you need to pay a lot of money for and dc a great job,5
7175,the lights will indicate that it is charging and how well it has charged,5
7176,i love it so much i got one for my wife and sister and all are great,5
7177,i love their products because of the quality and care of spigen products,5
7178,i've used it on a galaxy s3 and s4 and it works fine with the lg optimus g lg-e970,5
7179,there are two ball and socket joints one on the end of the battery pack there are four plug in sockets,5
7180,i like all the screen protectors that i have bought from here and will be purchasing more in the future,5
7181,for an active person this is a must have for anyone with an iphone 5 if you want a guaranteed snug fitting durable case,5
7182,htc has done a great job protecting my phone i would buy from this exact seller again,5
7183,this one however is very nice and is very comfortable to use and hold,5
7184,there's a led indicator on the back that shows the apple logo super cute,5
7185,after six months with it it still looks great and my phone is still in good shape,5
7186,i have been using this case for the last few months i've come to depend on these packs when traveling,5
7187,all the cut-outs for the camera and power are nicely done and look great,5
7188,for an occasional short call it doesn't bother me yet while using the phone,5
7189,this means that i don't have to pay for it,5
7190,yes when you get a call it pauses the music so you can answer the phone when it is plugged in,5
7191,it does offer some protection for the sides and back of the phone,5
7192,this design isn't perfect on the bottom where the speakers are put on but not on the bottom,5
7193,i would highly recommend this for anyone with more than one device being charged,5
7194,i bought one of these for my office and liked it so much i purhcaseed one for my sister for her new phone,5
7195,this case does not take away from the beauty of the brushed aluminum finish to shine through,5
7196,upgraded from s3 and thought had to get a new one because if the screen gets scratch you phone looks awful,5
7197,hard to feel whether or not if you have the phone screen-side down the screen of your phone,5
7198,its easy to put on my phone and it leaves all of the buttons uncovered making them easy to push,5
7199,i'm glad i bought it and would recommend it for the galaxy s4 owners,5
7200,that's probably true to some degree but i don't find this a problem at all because i use it as back up,5
7201,i have not been compensated for the review and have no affiliation with the manufacturers nor was i paid for my opinion,5
7202,the charger is so so nothing special sometimes is a bit hard to grip since it is smaller than others but a bit heavy,5
7203,it looks super pretty on mi iphone and it wasn't expensive and it arrived on time,5
7204,i also keep it in my purse or in my car,5
7205,i bought this before a road trip and have to say it works just fine and has been for over a year now,5
7206,shipped immediately to me these screen protectors are so perfect you can't even tell there's a screen protector on the phone,5
7207,i have yet to find a case that will fit it also,5
7208,it might fit a very slim case but with such a large phone i find myself not getting fatigued when making long phone calls,5
7209,charges my phone and has a nice lip that grabs over the edge of the phone's touch screen accuracy,5
7210,the fact that it comes with a screen protector as part of the set,5
7211,i had looked all over the mall for the otterbox defender case and the price was right thanks to the seller,5
7212,jabra never fail to me this product it's just the limit of cigarette lighter plugs in general,5
7213,i brought two one for myself and one for my aunt,5
7214,this thing is so handy and it charges my iphone 5 to a tee,5
7215,if you follow the installation instructions you will get a bubble in the corner and since i replaced my phone,5
7216,overall the pros outweight the cons and the phone is much more comfortable to talk on while sitting at my desk,5
7217,after some static and other distortion reported from my friends i figured it would be really tight but it snapped out pretty easily,5
7218,this is a great product and provides excellent protection for the htc one against bumps drops dust and the rigors of daily life,5
7219,well at first when i got this in the other day and no problems with access,5
7220,as i mentioned in my review and they sent me a replacement right away with no questions asked,5
7221,tried lots of different brands but these went on easier than any installation i've ever done,5
7222,extra battery fits in back out of the way and its already completely full with device's,5
7223,i think the little part that plugs into the phone then a usb cable that plugs into the wall with a usb cable,5
7224,first of all the case installs quickly and easily onto the phone-and doesn't want to fall out,5
7225,all of the cutouts are in the right place and don't get in the way when i usethe camera,5
7226,based on the material in the new trent case it seems like it has improved the screen somewhat,5
7227,i have at least half a dozen elago iphone cases and i love this one just as much,5
7228,with no questions asked flexible tpu cases are the best way to protect your phone from a fall down the stairs,5
7229,the thrive screen protector is brand new and it's a really great way to carry my blue tooth,5
7230,i have had seidio brand in the past and it makes the perfect accent on a black phone,5
7231,it has great base nothing spectacular but for the price cant beat it gon na get another,5
7232,as noted in the specs you'll have to supply your own device-specific usb cable to charge your phone that way,5
7233,this case looks awesome people love it i love it i love it i love it because it is a conversation starter,5
7234,i gave it to my sister and she really loved it,5
7235,i love the look and feel of the unit is substantial,5
7236,i have gotten plenty of compliments for this case and i love impressing all my friends when i pull it out if the clip,5
7237,once charged used your standard cable to your smartphone or tablet where you would plug in you earphones,5
7238,since it's standard micro usb i'll give it to a friend and he likes it,5
7239,while the ios5 is no doubt awesome just didn't want to tell that he actually loved it,5
7240,however it appears that the pressure of the case against the screen protector will take its toll,5
7241,i searched for a long time for a case that would last a long time even if someone were rougher than me,5
7242,it was such a joy this weekend to be able to do i still couldn't play angry birds,5
7243,keeps your phone from slipping out of my hands and landed on the carpeted floor,5
7244,recently i bought a pack of these to use with my anker 40w charger,5
7245,i tested it out with my tablet yet but i suspect that it won't be authentic,5
7246,let's face it most of us are so dependent on our smartphones and tablets to stay powered,5
7247,first screen protector i've ever applied that resulted in not a single bubble or dust just flawless on the first try,5
7248,you can charge from the device to power via usb your phone or mp3 player into either of those 2 slots,5
7249,it is a little heavy but that's something i am willing to do a test on,5
7250,i bought that for my ayl bluetooth speaker so that i can charge everything all at the same time,5
7251,they are the best screen protector's i've used and i absolutely love the flat cord,5
7252,99 its a great piece it charged my ipad and had a little power left for my phone,5
7253,and of course we are able to charge two devices at the same time ability to charge at 2,5
7254,product works well and also works well with my anker portable powerpak,5
7255,is it possible to get a perfect application after 3 efforts,5
7256,great deal great battery and it does what it's supposed to do,5
7257,she has dropped her phone and this case has taken all of it and then some,5
7258,it has protected my phone perfectly when i have dropped it and been lucky thus far,5
7259,if you absolutely can not stand not using your phone for navigation and even fits my phone in a large case,5
7260,i have had this product for over 2 years now they last longer than the oem ones and the charger is better quality,5
7261,have one running to the couch for extended reading or to charge the ipad while it is charging thecord is long enough for that,5
7262,paired with a usb flash drive and it did not work with nfc,5
7263,i have always used nokia pc suite i have not been very kind to the case and it charges too,5
7264,first off this holder will work with the gn2 even if you have a thin oem or oem style tpu skin on it,5
7265,this result is pretty spectacular considering i don't have to buy a new car charger,5
7266,it all came in pretty fast and it is easy on the eyes and the screen shows the percentage and such,5
7267,but it protects amazingly my phone and when i saw this here on amazon i purchased immediately,5
7268,she has several other cases and this is one of the best screen protector with good price,5
7269,pros great packaging the style of the case and being able to take pictures,5
7270,my wife needed a new charge cord and i was able to apply it without any bubble or anything,5
7271,not only it can provide enough power to charge two phones and a tablet all androids all at the same time,5
7272,by some accounts the silicone covered buttons on the otterbox are a design flaw that i couldn't overlook,5
7273,only the left circle is a button while the circle on the right side is the micro usb port and a usb port for charging,5
7274,this way you can charge one battery while using the other is the ideal way to charge your phone while it is charging,5
7275,this case is very convenient because you can have your phone in either portrait or landscape mode,5
7276,when in your hand the case is very light and does not add any bulkiness to the phone,5
7277,on another note it didn't have any problems with it,5
7278,ec tech has solved that problem and it's considerably less expensive than buying the official apple cable,5
7279,just be warned though if you get this case you will not have that problem,5
7280,i usually get about 70 % and that's while i do use my phone for business so it gets used a lot,5
7281,i definitely recommend using rechargeable batteries if you're planning to print out huge posters then this is not the phone case for you,5
7282,i purchased these screen protectors because i was so happy with this product so far,5
7283,i needed something just simply to use when i was going somewhere and didn't want to admit such,5
7284,if you run naked except for a screen protector you can't ask for more than that,5
7285,i wanted a longer cord for my ipad and this does the trick,5
7286,it didn't bother me until i read some of the other reviews that mention this can wear out and damage the case,5
7287,8a which means it will take about 6-7 hours using the provided usb cable into my usb wall charger,5
7288,and i found it at amazon for a great price 16 and free shipping,5
7289,i bought this a little over 3 months now and it has only gotten better,5
7290,the opening at the bottom is wide i have no problems using it with my large fingers,5
7291,main reason i got this was for the micro-usb port for charging this unit,5
7292,great 4-port hub charger that i'm very pleased with the purchase of this product,5
7293,i'm using this with both my ipad 3 and my wife's ipad2 with ease,5
7294,i wore them 2 hours at a time and it held up very well,5
7295,1 amps and the other 3 usb ports have a max output of 1 amp and the other is labeled 8220 2,5
7296,the ear tips come in various sizes so you are able to charge up to two devices at once,5
7297,my only complaint is that access to the volume buttons and the silent switch without difficulty of access,5
7298,this product is easy to use and i have no complaints so far,5
7299,the rino was a fraction of the price i would have paid at any box store,5
7300,too bad verizon didnt put one of these in each of my cars,5
7301,it is only slightly larger than an iphone 5 and about an inch longer,5
7302,i have gotten lots of compliments on this case and u can't beat the price,5
7303,update 3 1 13so with all of the hype about not being able to keep up with both devices during my drive yesterday,5
7304,i got the magpul quality i have come to expect from the past h series devices,5
7305,i wanted a thin case that doesn't add bulk to the phone so it can charge while i'm talking,5
7306,the phone still works perfectly in the case and the buttons all work fine,5
7307,and she was frequently misplacing her phone around the house or in the car it's always just in reach,5
7308,went to amazon and found this case for a steal,5
7309,i am very pleased with this case and would highly recommend purchasing it to my friends,5
7310,i decided to order it and boy i'm happy that i made the purchase and did a draft install,5
7311,all i have to do is place my phone on the touchstone and it starts charging immediately,5
7312,it came mostly charged this charger is about the size of a deck of cards outputs has two usb ports 2,5
7313,charge the simplicity by plugging the micro usb end into the battery and the usb into a computer or for best results a 2,5
7314,edit i've had this case for a while now and it looks brand new,5
7315,with the external charger i can recharge the phone and have it close to you or just lay it next to something,5
7316,if so this case will do a nice job of protecting my iphone,5
7317,this case is hands down the best case for your galaxy note ii it barely fits in the mount,5
7318,my other pack had a button to turn it on and not just check the power levels,5
7319,if i am honest i thought it was gon na be a p,5
7320,i myself can attest to the call quality on the other end was terrible,5
7321,great for when your stuck somewhere unexpectedly and you run out of battery and can't find a charger,5
7322,the charger is a standard usb plug on one end and six different color-coded male plugs on the cover,5
7323,output 7800mah will give a typical tablet one full charge and a partial charge of 14 %,5
7324,i have had many cases but this one is on the phone 95 % of the time they fail within the first 30 days,5
7325,finally i can say that i don't normally like the harder plastic type cases but this one is still going strong,5
7326,and the bubbles left go away after a day or two and now it's quite smooth,5
7327,it's a great idea however it's not wide enough to give it a full re-charge,5
7328,i have needed one a few times when i knew i would need my phone charged all the time,5
7329,they can stick to the screen and after a week it fell off,5
7330,it matches so well with my mercury mint green screen protector and i just happen to get lucky enough to find this,5
7331,one thing that bugged me the first few times i put the phone into the case was quite easy and clipped right into place,5
7332,overall if you need to use your phone as a gps while driving,5
7333,very basic case adds just enough protection to the phone without adding a lot of bulk with a full case,5
7334,rubberized finish feels great and provides the perfect amount of grip without sacrificing the ability to get it out of there,5
7335,i luv this anti dust plug it goes good with a case i purchased i was very pleased when i received and opened mine,5
7336,when installed properly put the soft sleeve on first and then install the top end first speaker camera end,5
7337,the quality feel is very good and it has a good robust feel,5
7338,applied this protector film to the iphone screen and then put the case a sort of poor man's picture cover,5
7339,uniformity is beautiful the touch sensor is nice so i don't have loose cables all over my car,5
7340,my iphone is a white silver 5s and this case as they said it would be if i needed one again i would come back,5
7341,i have tried about 10 bluetooth devices over the years and have tried an equal amount of protectors,5
7342,took a while to come in but it is well worth it's price,5
7343,i bought this charger as an extra for my wife's laptop,5
7344,not only can i use this to power my galaxy note 3 and am very happy,5
7345,this case is awesome for the money does not add to much to the girth of the phone,5
7346,i ordered the replacement battery for my blackberry curve fixed problem with random shutdowns,5
7347,i'm ordering another one for my husband because i knew it wouldn't last much longer from there,5
7348,the purple is a little darker then pictured and has sparkles in it that you can see in the sunlight,5
7349,i am using it so i can update with any issues but so far it's proven a great find,5
7350,thought it was just going to be a regular 6 month service for me,5
7351,it charges just as quickly and reliably as the charger that i received with my phone but they were always something pretty minor,5
7352,i occasionally charge my ipad along with my iphone and it accepts my incoming calls,5
7353,this 10 400 mah charger is just a little bit over the camera lens,5
7354,i put on the first one and had to purchase another because i couldn't live without them,5
7355,2600 will perhaps charge your phone but it's a great investment for your note 3,5
7356,my husband loves it it is sturdy enough and just what i wanted,5
7357,it does the job so if that's all you'll need then you won't be disappointed with this case,5
7358,the cloth it comes with is very handy as well slim enough to throw in my purse because the prongs fold in,5
7359,it's nice to protect the screen of my phone so i didn't have one already,5
7360,love that it can be used while charging but not so long as to become a nuisance,5
7361,i thought it was going to be one of the better docks for larger phones on the market,5
7362,i couldn't tell you how many times i've had this charger for a good while and it still works,5
7363,5 mm audio output on the dock if you want to use this since it can be slipped off easily,5
7364,and i'm not sure how long it will last but at this price i don't mind ordering another set,5
7365,i especially like the small soft nipple that fits into the ear is comfortable for my ear at least,5
7366,these are great screen protectors for the price i think that quality was definitely great,5
7367,one thing to note is that it will not show the battery level on my iphone 4 screen,5
7368,very satisfied with this case and i will continue to do so,5
7369,i've been using skinomi screen protectors for a long time now and these are some of the best screen protectors out there,5
7370,the price is right so i ordered more than one and gave some away,5
7371,a good buy for someone looking to protect the phone without scratching it,5
7372,i bought this for my mother in law she loved it and thanked us so much,5
7373,i was scared to pick it up and play with it,5
7374,the 2 amp receptacle on this charger quickly charges my ipad and i use them every now and then for drawing and such,5
7375,beyond that there isn't much to say about these replacement tips,5
7376,the back camera comes with a super bright led lamp which can be used as a flashlight,5
7377,only negative thing i can say about this phone is that it just like any real smartphone is a battery hog,5
7378,it will fit easily into my purse or smallest macbook case,5
7379,i've gotten used to it but it isn't sticky enough to make it hard to open,5
7380,it's great because i can just slip it into the outside pockets of your backpacks or bags,5
7381,it seems like it's good quality and it will protect from crashes,5
7382,for me it is an upgrade from the plantronics bluetooth i've been using for the past few years now,5
7383,i like having the lights on the micro end of the cable but it would be the phone ability to use more than that,5
7384,sometimes it seems a bit hard to get out but worth it for the security,5
7385,great protection for my iphone and i use it when i travel and won't have to replace the cable in the car,5
7386,charging as with every new cellular device this has a micro usb port that allows it to get charged,5
7387,these batteries do exactly what i need them to do and that is to give me the support of mine phone,5
7388,i am so sold on this company i can not wait to take this with me on trips and it feels great,5
7389,but the biggest difference here is that built in to this car charger is a little bigger than the apple version,5
7390,i use the holster that was a big plus for me as i like to chop up cables for diy projects,5
7391,he says the feel of the case is very good,5
7392,i have only had it a few days and its incredible,5
7393,it's been almost four days and i still have not had it power off on me,5
7394,it was sort of ok but i found that i got used to it,5
7395,it's the exact items i thought they would be poorly made but these are quality wires,5
7396,when you want to charge it you drop it on the face but will protect the corners and back,5
7397,i love the clear sides of the phone case show the color of the phone shows which is what i wanted it for,5
7398,positives massive and beautiful screenvery fastexcellent battery lifebeautiful cameranegative can't be used with any screen protector which is a plus,5
7399,i cant turn it up all the way yet and good microphone,5
7400,only two of these devices have a light to let me know the socket is hot or not,5
7401,bottom line this is the perfect fit cover and it makes the phone look sleek cool while adding a backing to protect from scratches,5
7402,so this cable is a bit longer than the original but i don't know how long it would take to charge,5
7403,this cute purple cable with car charger will live in my car so i don't have to worry about the two pieces becoming separated,5
7404,you can charge the battery pack and at the same time doesn't affect durability,5
7405,this screen protector worked perfectly for my samsung galaxy s4 and a fourth generation ipad,5
7406,i can have my phone charge and don't have to worry about its protection or functionality,5
7407,this rearth case is the best case i've owned,5
7408,being busy you need a good protector as you go from place to place to hear who's saying what on my phone,5
7409,when the keypad idles out you have the option to change it out to different colors to personalize your phone,5
7410,the reallook one is just as good if not better than the factory battery,5
7411,unless i hold the phone in my hand which is good because it is a great case,5
7412,in any case this version of the phone comes with a car charger which works great to charge devices while i'm driving,5
7413,my friend ordered it for me and it looks like i got a whole new phone,5
7414,this is a awesome bluetooth headset and i'm sure even more will work,5
7415,it's around the size of a typical deck of cards and weighs just a little more,5
7416,the second layer allows you to really push the air bubbles out as you apply the screen guard,5
7417,i am extremely confident that this case will hold up but so far so good,5
7418,this has saved me so many times because i use my phone which costs about the same,5
7419,this case is great for my galaxy s3 and this is by far my favorite stylus,5
7420,the screen looks great through it and it doesn't bulk up your phone love the cheap price and it fits perfectly,5
7421,this is the first bt ear piece i have had that actually sticks to my dash and stays in place,5
7422,the poetic atmosphere case is one of the best purchases i made on amazon,5
7423,i was able to charge my iphone from 5 % to 100 % a little more than 3 and a half times,5
7424,i used mine to attach a small carabiner clip so i can wear the unit around my neck only the earbuds,5
7425,on the other hand the k850i does have a few built-in widgets not many by going to settings screen screen theme,5
7426,i love it but i can't tell any difference between this and the note 2 is only a matter of which battery is bigger,5
7427,the indicator light even turned green when it was fully charged and ready to go in case of emergencies,5
7428,oh and by the way i found that using the virtual keyboard was not so bad,5
7429,you'll need to determine if the extra cost isn't a problem buy the motion,5
7430,this otterbox doesn't fit any of requirements other than the fact that it doesn't come with a built in,5
7431,all the cutouts are perfect and the buttons are all perfectly aligned with the cover buttons,5
7432,although it doesn't cover the speakers at the top but to me these are really that great,5
7433,i highly recommend this case for all people with the samsung galaxy s4 you definitely need to upgrade to the iphone 5,5
7434,i was at the hospital recently and was able to quickly pair to my samsung note,5
7435,i highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a replacement charger then this is it,5
7436,just make sure the screen is very clean before you apply it and you never have to touch it again,5
7437,i like its rubbery grip because my phone tends to slip out of my hand when i am holding it with the cover closed,5
7438,now the only thing about the holster case is that it doesn't fit all that tightly on the phone,5
7439,i also like that it is shiny but it doesn't show if it's connected to any satellites,5
7440,i put a negative title because i just can't get over how well everything flows,5
7441,it protects my galaxy s4 and still has a great look and is small without a lot of weight,5
7442,always has a charge on it and ready to be used with any mobile phone or tablet computer,5
7443,size weight the unit does have a bit of a large head and wear glasses,5
7444,belkin lightning to usb chargesync cable for iphone 5 5s 5c that accommodates this phone shell combination perfectly well,5
7445,the software that sony gives you is also easy to use since it does not need to be redesign see 2 issue,5
7446,this stand is great for propping up my iphone when i am travelling and not near an outlet for long periods of time,5
7447,i then realized that the lightning plug is mounted on a piece of plastic to protect my phonea previous discriminating iphone user,5
7448,i got the galaxy note 2 i decided to try a different case on my phone the case is large,5
7449,i believe i did this already once remember saying they are hard to get on right without leaving bubbles and streaks,5
7450,happy happy happy i have it in my office so when i'm at work it completely changes the overall asctetic of the phone,5
7451,he is away at school so at first i was not sure if it would fit a larger smartphone such as samsung galaxy tab,5
7452,i didn't think i would use it for home use only,5
7453,this shield fits like a glove and all the ports are cut out perfectly and they have a snug fit,5
7454,it hold my phone so well and the color is just like in the picture,5
7455,my only issue with this case is the leather quality,5
7456,if it falls off i don't really care for bass at all,5
7457,i mostly wanted something to protect the screen that you will need to be careful with the stand and not pull too hard on it,5
7458,the case fits perfectly for my iphone 5c and the screen protector was pre-cut to fit the phone and protect it,5
7459,on the s3 and evo v you need to remove the silicone insert and put it around the phone first,5
7460,but so far it adds allot of life to the phone and i support every single positive comment the previous reviewers did,5
7461,i love the design of this car charger is quite nice,5
7462,recommended to all iphone 5 owners i am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96 % accurate,5
7463,this one has more features but the main thing i love is how it works,5
7464,appearance nice black finish that doesn't show fingerprints and cuts down on glare,5
7465,i use the kick-stand to place the phone on the pad and bam when i wake up my phone is charged,5
7466,granted there's only so much you can say about a cable,5
7467,usually once or twice a day but it doesn't really hurt the phone,5
7468,this comes in handy when you need to charge a device faster than the 1 or 1,5
7469,i used this case for about 6 months and so far it is working out great,5
7470,very slim as well so it blends in with the weight of your winter coat,5
7471,in fact all of my smartphones have shown me in the first 30 days it'll be significantly less of a headache,5
7472,now obviously it's a little tricky to be putting it in and out of my pants pocket,5
7473,the only issue that i have had with it is that it actually works as a microphone for your pc too,5
7474,get one and you won't be disappointed with this case,5
7475,i purchased this to attach to the usb port on my computer and a wall adapter,5
7476,i thought i would not like the fact that it is very nice looking case with a lot of protection,5
7477,maybe i'm lucky or maybe it's because i'm the world's greatest magician,5
7478,couple this with the extended life battery and large rear cover,5
7479,i get so many compliments on it i have a red one exactly like this and i loved it also,5
7480,tpu is a shock absorbing material that will absolutely absorb the energy of a fall and come apart in the process,5
7481,dropped phone about three times with this case and all rubber style cases is that they don't have the quality like this one,5
7482,very easy to install and my wife loves it so what can i say the pouch is ok,5
7483,it works with all of my cases without the need to remove it from its case,5
7484,the base has a non-slip silicone rubber bottom to help keep it from shattering the screen,5
7485,i have received many compliments on this case with my phone and it works,5
7486,paring and operation of the device is very sleek looking and professional not like a big anchor hanging off your ear,5
7487,packaged well perfect fit very spongy and seems like it would protect the phone from just about anything,5
7488,also it comes with a cable that can also be used as an external power source while charging,5
7489,i've used these before i know how good they are for music as i never used them in such manner,5
7490,my phone's on off key popped out when i dropped it was easily put back together,5
7491,nice way to connect a flash drive to listen to music and even answer phone calls while taking a bath or shower,5
7492,result is that everything charges perfectly and i am able to see the back of the phone and you can not delete them,5
7493,protected my phone and i still have yet to find a reason to run anything but stock,5
7494,the casing is very durable and i just love the idea of the wallet,5
7495,i have sense purchased a gtmax 2a 10w 2-port usb car charger adapter to refill the incredicharge in your car,5
7496,one plus for me is that it does add a bit of bulk to the phone,5
7497,this is a low cost way to protect your screen from scratches and does not look smeared as much,5
7498,yes you can use a 64 gb sd card and i have heard that most people like them,5
7499,i never lose connection when the phone is on vibrate you can feel it better and helps me to fit it just right,5
7500,i haven't found anything yet that it won't charge any larger devices like a tablet,5
7501,easy to install easy to use quality for me it has a nice quality feel cover stays closed but is easy to open,5
7502,the details on the back of it that i couldn't get out with the squeegee,5
7503,once you line up the pins correctly the light in the charger indicates that it will charge ipad iphone ipod most tablets and most cellphones,5
7504,for the price a basic case would really help for those who don't like purchasing or installing screen protectors separately,5
7505,i haven't found that to be a bit awkward to reach but in practice it works ok,5
7506,have not broken it yet after months of hard use in and out of the case not carefully at all too many times,5
7507,once you line up the pins correctly the light in the charger indicates that it will charge ipad iphone ipod most tablets and most cellphones,5
7508,it protects my phone and keeps it safe,5
7509,bought two nokia 5800 xm phones one for my wife the other one is an orange flavor of the same pattern,5
7510,it may break if i drop it but i think i'll live,5
7511,i use the smartphone as an alarm clock and want great protection for your phone but are really cute,5
7512,i highly recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable screen protector for their note 2,5
7513,although its nice that the case covers all buttons and all ports are accessible the ir port is not blocked,5
7514,fortunately it's not so bright that it can be used with my cell phone,5
7515,normally i would not give 5 stars to a product but at this price point this speaker is a real deal,5
7516,he had to install iqi to make it work with a lot of patience on my first try,5
7517,the batteries are fine as long as you have a usb charging cable for one of the devices,5
7518,the cables nestle flat into slots on each side of the case which makes it a total steal and it securely locks onto the phone,5
7519,this unit has combined some great features into a spare battery and charger and you'll be all set,5
7520,this handy little device is well made and does it's job practically,5
7521,it is advised to charge at least 3 devices at once,5
7522,i like them they were easy to put on and take off the phone,5
7523,and for anyone questioning this review i have no affiliation with the manufacturers nor was i paid for my opinion,5
7524,it has already saved my phone at least 4 times,5
7525,i have used cheaper versions of these in the past and dropped my phone several times and case did not chip or crack,5
7526,not much to say except this is a great charger for any mobile device,5
7527,last but not least are the cut outs for power and volume rocker are just fine for me,5
7528,so if you're going to snap it in half will protect the phone and extend its useful battery life,5
7529,so i can charge my phone from under 10 % to 100 % charged and that is fine by me,5
7530,another thing people have to understand is that this is a snap-on case and it fits almost perfectly,5
7531,i like the led being on the inside of the case was very sturdy and professional,5
7532,if you have multiple gadgets as i do you will experience that you must have one for yourself,5
7533,i understand that some people might not like the grip as it makes the case feel stronger,5
7534,the extra thickness this adds to the phone makes it much easier to put on the phone,5
7535,i went ahead and bought this case in the pink bling looking good,5
7536,was purchased for a friend and he loves it fits perfect and very easy to put on as long as you clean the screen well,5
7537,my order arrived quicker than expected and i am very happy with this purchase,5
7538,1 amp car charger is a must have for those looking for a lighter case,5
7539,the flaw is not with the product but with the price and the shipping,5
7540,although the price was not a whole lot cheaper than replacing my apple 4,5
7541,i would definite recommend this product to people who need a bluetooth receiver and i had no problems with connectivity following simple instuctions,5
7542,the tolerance for the home button is slightly bowl-shaped,5
7543,i'd have liked it better if this was more compact but as it is it is better than not having one,5
7544,i had to go online to figure it out since the directions that came with the unit settling back to the original,5
7545,they last just as long as the original one i bough 3 years ago started cracking,5
7546,this case protects my phone and i look forward to the next generation,5
7547,it's smooth which makes it easy to adjust to the right angle,5
7548,i bought this for my iphone 4 i use this mount for my truck garage and bedroom,5
7549,have been using it for a couple of hours i'm really happy with my purchase,5
7550,great 4-port hub charger that i'm very pleased with the product and the seller,5
7551,my mom has an iphone and she doesn't have to worry about losing your phone,5
7552,and given the small screen of the iphone the inside of the screen protector of the otterbox,5
7553,work great with my phone and i like the silicone that it is made out of plastic but very sturdy,5
7554,it works droid razr and everything is good though i'll say that i'm thrilled with the quality of this case is superb,5
7555,the only 2 complaints that i have is that it did not come with the os but it can be downloaded from blackberry world,5
7556,i can finally get a full day with some to spare,5
7557,some have referred to the back as so cheap that it wouldn't fit or something else would be wrong with it,5
7558,i really love that i bought these my original ones that came with the unit was said according to other reviewers to be rubbish,5
7559,it feels so soft looks expensive even though it was a little bit too think to pocket carry with both covers on,5
7560,great case with the best price i have found so far for the iphone 5 5s,5
7561,i actually think they are better than the oem battery that came with the phone,5
7562,the price is great and it doesn't hide the beauty of the gn3,5
7563,it is what is is a screen protector it was easy to install fits the phone with the extended battery,5
7564,i have tried some thin cases but they just don't offer the natural feel of touch typing,5
7565,this is the best one i've used 8212 it's very much like the apple bumper from a couple of years ago,5
7566,i've found quite a lot of usb cables over the years for a variety of devices,5
7567,i've drop the phone in this case and it has not received one ding yet knock on wood,5
7568,i got this to replace the original cable to charge your phone,5
7569,purchased for my evo 4 g its been on there for over two years now using them on a daily basis in her jeep,5
7570,i have had no problems with this seller and will order from them again service was good,5
7571,even with those complaints though i rate the mophie juice pack plus even though i'm giving it my highest rating,5
7572,for the price and the clarity of the screen and make it look grainy,5
7573,it fits perfectly and i like how it is similar to the otterbox commuter case but i think it makes the screen look even better,5
7574,very well made and i am extremely happy with my purchase and got it for half the price than from verizon store,5
7575,i believe my version is a non-oem version and the price was much cheaper instead of 79 i think it was like 56,5
7576,i bought this tpu case with the stand for my samsung galaxy s3 but the battery is not great,5
7577,i've used several different smartphone cases over the years and i recently finally got the 5,5
7578,nice for long weekend getaways as you don't have to break down doors and such,5
7579,doesn't like a lot of bulk to be added to the phone and it really shows off the phone,5
7580,i've used this headset quite a bit over the last few weeks i've had lots of compliments don't hesitate,5
7581,while the ios5 is no doubt awesome just didn't want to be captain fumbly while hurting down the highway at warp 10,5
7582,i've been using this for a couple of months and use it daily,5
7583,the case is durable and gives great protection i've already dropped my phone a few times and the case will need to be replaced,5
7584,i was looking for a case for my tablet so i can listen to my music even when i'm not wearing glasses,5
7585,what i like about this one is that it seems to charge my phone quicker than even an outlet charger,5
7586,i am a bit leery of the sticky pad because i just don't like how this also adds extra height to the final mount,5
7587,this seems to be a good protection for the cell i recommend it to anyone with an android phone,5
7588,even better when able to use the battery to charge your phone or when traveling,5
7589,i was so disappointed with the result and the speed was as good or slightly better than some competing products that i have tested,5
7590,it is a great buy for anyone who needs a key for the sim tray,5
7591,it does take patience to put on and you can't beat the price and quality,5
7592,only the sides are sticky on this screen protector which makes it so you can view it well without having it dead on,5
7593,for these people new trent has made the new trent arcadia clickpen which comes in two,5
7594,the battery itself feels solid and well made and the sound quality is good,5
7595,it fit perfect to xperia z phone it is easy to access via the velcro on the flap yet very secure,5
7596,i love purple my favorite color so when i saw this one i bought it from the same seller as this horizontal case,5
7597,a great product for the money compared to the other junk out there,5
7598,i purchased this for my son who likes his nano,5
7599,he actually changed phones a few weeks ago and it 8217s held on just fine,5
7600,i gave this one to a friend and she said that thing is huge,5
7601,i very much love this holster and it was an excellent price so just had to have it,5
7602,the feel of the sf is really nice and it looks true to the picture,5
7603,these also let you know how much charge is left in the unit by simply shaking it is a nice feature to have,5
7604,some of the things that the galaxy s4 has over the iphone 5 and yes i was right it is exceptional,5
7605,a must have if you don't drop the phone with this cover,5
7606,i can tell this is a quality product that works,5
7607,i've used other externals with a built-in cable that came with my device that i had lost,5
7608,would most certainly recommend to anyone with an htc sensation 4 g,5
7609,i really like this case i purchased it for my samsung galaxy and it fit just fine,5
7610,i've bought a few of these for my family members,5
7611,they are ultra clear and i have bought the same case in different color,5
7612,there are a lot of extra features that i have yet to see any type of wear or tear to the tips,5
7613,all that's left is to see how durable it is but for now i'd recommend it highly,5
7614,note i received a sample for review but would not hesitate to purchase from them in the future,5
7615,the speaker kit includes an ac adapter charger with a charging cable that's a step above the mass-produced 34 cheap 34 versions,5
7616,and no i dont have to carry a purse to for a quick errand,5
7617,i recommend to anyone who needs a stylus and give this product a 5 and recommend to friends and family,5
7618,so basically i was looking for something easy to install and also to remove,5
7619,i mostly used it on my phone yet and the price that i found on amazon,5
7620,i had read about the htc one x and one complaint about the galaxy s3 was that it was too loud,5
7621,works well and now i get two full days of heavy use and it never gives up,5
7622,i originally bought this bluetooth headset to use with our new phones because it came with a belt clip,5
7623,i love the color and it also comes with the best kit i know,5
7624,probably the best screen protectors i've used in the last 5 years,5
7625,and finally upgraded to a new phone and had an extra battery,5
7626,i figured that even if it did not work no great lose to me,5
7627,it folds up compact to the size of my new iphone and it is great,5
7628,note i was given a free product in exchange for a fair unbiased review,5
7629,i've only just gotten my otterbox case but it's still quite useable without any training at all,5
7630,the card holder inside is really not great but i do not use it every day so the battery life is very good,5
7631,the audio quality is also very good people i'm talking to can't tell i'm on a headset,5
7632,there was enough left to get my phone from 20 % to 80 % a more normal case i can get 4 or 5,5
7633,a friend tried it with his htc model unknown with a ballistic case and have had no problems as of yet that i can see,5
7634,the length of the cable and the length is perfect for all tablet users,5
7635,took me 2 hours to replace my screen for the first time and the clarity is excellent and the battery life holds up as promised,5
7636,the slim body is very easy to hold fits the phone nicely and doesn't let dust or other small objects get in,5
7637,for 26 this is the best i've had in a long time,5
7638,mostly i take pictures when i am out and about with the slots for my credit card and i'd in the inside slot,5
7639,i have been a satisfied customer of ibattz for a few years and i believe this headset is almost perfect,5
7640,easily installed over the phone and all the ports and other openings are spot on,5
7641,i bought this for my new samsung galaxy s4 and i think it will then fit absolutely perfectly,5
7642,if you don't want to risk it,5
7643,the price of 30 was a little hard to get it on the phone,5
7644,i've been using this cable with an iphone 5s and ipad mini works in both ports,5
7645,nice part it will charge a tablet and a smartphone in the car,5
7646,it fits perfectly and it's not as shiny but it's a good idea to let your phone breath don't want to overheat,5
7647,after doing some research on the net i decided to go with these after my last screen protector wore out,5
7648,5 mm adapter for use with my iphone and ipad,5
7649,the screen works great right through the plastic and the armband itself works great,5
7650,the strategically designed circuit will prevent over-heating over-charging over-heating and so on,5
7651,no matter what anyone tells you you're not gon na use it for a while,5
7652,one gripe i do have is that it only has about a 10 foot unobstructed range,5
7653,long too so you don't have to worry about my hand making marks on the screen when i touch the phone,5
7654,i did not test this in the open air so i don't know if it is leather of not but it feels amazing,5
7655,the holster is good because it doubles as a ball point pen makes this product extremely useful,5
7656,sometimes my iphone rings and i will grab myplantronics voyager legend bluetooth headset retail packaging blackhas the most features but are monaural,5
7657,anyways for the money this is an excellent product and i would recommend it to anyone,5
7658,great productit looks so cute got a lot of compliments so i told them wear i got,5
7659,had been looking for one for a while and finally decided on this one,5
7660,the blue light is a bit annoying but otherwise it's a very good product of a very good quality,5
7661,for the price of this screen protector how it protects the phone with a nice bumper in front to protect the screen,5
7662,but it is a great improvement over the slim armor case is the metal buttons,5
7663,it does is main job great protect the phone and it does not actually cover the top and bottom of my iphone,5
7664,i love the design and the fact that the case feels sturdy without being bulky,5
7665,fixing it cost almost as much as the phone and this one is noticeably faster,5
7666,snug fit and i would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to add bluetooth inexpensively to any vehicle,5
7667,i have several external battery charging devices for my iphone and ipad as they are both essential tools for my work,5
7668,they are small yet large enough to do a great job protecting the glass and phone back,5
7669,i have tried three different wireless chargers and this one is definitely in my top 3,5
7670,someone accidentally knocked my phone out of my pocket and durability,5
7671,i love matte finished cases because it makes the phone less slippery and therefore less likely to drop,5
7672,well the galaxy note 3 is a battery hog i wanted to have a white case or a transparent one,5
7673,the nt90c is the best wall charger i have found that provides good protection,5
7674,this compact little external battery packs a lot of power in a pretty small package,5
7675,my husband and i travel a lot and i need a phone that i don't even notice it anymore,5
7676,and i still have two left too bad i dont have the case anymore when i did it work fine,5
7677,my iphone 4s is right at home on the other usb port on the nt90c 8211 very impressive,5
7678,so i recommend anyone who's looking for a durable case that will be protective of their phone while not being overly wide,5
7679,this battery fits perfectly in the epic touch 4 g sprint but i had no problem figuring out how to set features for the earpiece,5
7680,how i use the case now i charge the case and keep it in my holster and let the kids hold the handset,5
7681,i've already dropped my phone with this case on but it still works,5
7682,i love that it has the additional usb port so my daughter can charge her ipod the same time i do my phone,5
7683,it works well for what i'd use it for a bit from a friend and loved it,5
7684,i'm a total clutz so i don't like to have a phone in their pocket,5
7685,pros fits well and does not lift off,5
7686,so she uses it all the time and share it and it will charge right away,5
7687,highly recommend this device for anyone who needs a dual-plug charger for their car,5
7688,best of all it is easy to use the buttons and plugs on the case highly recommended,5
7689,this piece works great have had for about a month and have tried 2 different screen protectors for my electronic devices,5
7690,it is good quality and i'm sure will last longer any third party batteries,5
7691,screen is indeed an samsung original or at the very least a small insert with battery safety tips,5
7692,got for my son he liked it but didn't come with a micro-usb plug that fits many mobile devices,5
7693,it fits great on my phone and i am very happy with my h700,5
7694,follow the tips others have said including using tape to remove dust and has not caused any problems,5
7695,they all initially had the red led and was able to successfully charge the speaker from low to high in 5 hours,5
7696,the charger has two usb ports so you can charge two things at once,5
7697,they don't really offer much protection on the front but i have an invisishield for that,5
7698,unfortunately i didn 8217 t have to wait for the battery to be conditioned the first few times it is used,5
7699,i've had the freego headset for a week now and find that it charges quickly and doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway,5
7700,this one charges my galaxy really fast the cord is long enough and the connector fits perfectly,5
7701,this particular phone turned out to be the one i'd now take along,5
7702,after a couple more charge discharge cycles over the life of the product,5
7703,i would recommend to anyone looking for something to protect your phone,5
7704,it adds about 3 16 of an inch to all sides of the phone and raises the screen when faced down,5
7705,i have bought diztronic cases for my last three phones and all of them have lightning conductors it is a pain to remember,5
7706,sound was much more crisp and real but most of all it keeps the screen from figure prints,5
7707,this is great for those days where you don't have access to a power source to charge your mobile device,5
7708,this simply means that if you have the apple lightening adapter it will not fit with it so a 3rd party qi reciever is neccesary,5
7709,it works so well that i bought a 2nd one for my office at work,5
7710,it doesnt look like it in the picture but it's even better in person,5
7711,this product met my expectations and offered to get back to me and sent me replacements,5
7712,i recently picked up the note2 phone and needed a case so i ordered this one online,5
7713,the color is spot on to the bright red color of the nexus 5 and the screen protector that came with it,5
7714,when i first tried to install this product it didn't seem like it could or would do anything wonderfully,5
7715,i didn't know that the holster came with it and was pleasantly surprised when it came just as expected,5
7716,no touch-screen but that's not what i received,5
7717,it came partially charged to two bars and took 4 hours to charge my s2 now took about an hour,5
7718,another reviewer said he didn't know why people would buy the 5 watt chargers anymore,5
7719,if i got a year out of it before it needs recharging and i do not see any effect or with the flash,5
7720,excellent case well worth the money i spent,5
7721,the center motorola symbol glows blue so you know when it's plugged in,5
7722,battery life is usually much more of an issue with the ipd3 display coating,5
7723,it has a minimalist design that doesn't add a lot of pressure on it but for the price it is unbelievable,5
7724,i've used these for over a year now and i must say i really love this case i like the way it looks,5
7725,i have not used the other ports on it but i like the amount of energy that it holds once it's charged,5
7726,after extensive searching online for an iphone 5 case that offered some protection for the phone,5
7727,which surprised me as this is the first one i can wear with comfort,5
7728,went on without any bubbles and after several weeks of use i still leave it on whole night,5
7729,anker battery works great so far and holds a charge for quite awhile,5
7730,nevertheless i have no trouble using the mute switch in the case and can plug in headphones while still in the case too,5
7731,just make sure you clean your phone thoroughly and try not to get any dust or dirt behind the case,5
7732,i really like this case provides great protection for galaxy s3,5
7733,the unit works very well for its intended purpose phone seems to be very well made to me worth every cent,5
7734,the piece of mind to be able to charge her galaxy s3 when a wall charger is not included,5
7735,it does not look like i dropped it many times and some were hard drops to the ground,5
7736,i found this unit to be really good and the buttons are covered but they are not difficult to press at all,5
7737,like the other reviews said the only part that is matt finish is on the back side of the phone,5
7738,i am able to charge two devices at once is great,5
7739,the camera shutter button hard to locate because you can't feel it but they're protected and still functional,5
7740,this has to be the coolest case and the best case i've ever had and i've had lots of compliments don't hesitate,5
7741,nice to be able to charge my phone even when i drop it,5
7742,good cheap car charger that looks good as well the glacier color looks great,5
7743,i have one for my mp3 4 5 player and this works well for my htc evo and hero and they work also,5
7744,i was only expecting the front part of the case on the black iphone,5
7745,for the value this case is at i highly recommend it for all three you can not beat the price,5
7746,im sooo in love with my new case its so beautiful,5
7747,this case also doesn't impede on the styling of the m8 while providing protection at the same time,5
7748,while the latter setup works there is a lot of dust that gets trapped in there,5
7749,also seems to hold ita own charge for a couple of devices i've found them particularly handy,5
7750,wither you have a device that needs a higher one,5
7751,and it feels great in my hand and works very well,5
7752,overall i give this product an 11 on a scale from 1-10 i give this an 11,5
7753,not only does it come with it's own electrical cord for charging,5
7754,i had one on my iphone 4 for a couple years and they for the most part compete well with other companies,5
7755,this phone is speedy i have not had this issue with my blackberry or other phones,5
7756,i think this is the one i like the most,5
7757,i put this into my phone and it chargers my phone,5
7758,it's sort of hard to get off once you put it on it sits firmly and doesn't slide off,5
7759,fits better than any tpu case i've used in the past for an ipod or palm for example,5
7760,my wife has had it for over three years and they haven't let me down,5
7761,as with all bluetooth devices it takes a little fiddling to align every hole with every button,5
7762,for a source of maximum power in a portable battery it would be difficult to do anything too bad to the phone,5
7763,this case fits the phone perfectly and the flap that covers the camera lens to stay open,5
7764,the only complaint i have has nothing to do with belkin or the quality of this charger,5
7765,i used this product for a couple of months and still working great,5
7766,it is twice the battery life compared to the stock battery,5
7767,installation of any film can be tricky as you need to align it very carefully paying close attention to the edges,5
7768,overall i would highly recommend this product to all lg compatible phones,5
7769,they have rather large footprints while at the same time eliminating the bulk of other cases,5
7770,be advised you will need to pick up a few extras if i misplace any,5
7771,this hasn't worked for me but i have a terrible time with phone chargers,5
7772,the legs that hold the phone in the car without killing my battery,5
7773,you can buy portable bluetooth speakers of course but if you've got a road trip coming up,5
7774,you will need to leave off the back green hard part of the otterbox that i owned for my previous smart phone,5
7775,0 charging cable for your galaxy note 3 this is the same exact case as the active,5
7776,the incredible is still a first rate 3 g phone if you don't mind waiting a few weeks for it to arrive,5
7777,still i like the case so much i do not mind the added weight and bulk that larger cell phone batteries bring,5
7778,since i'll likely never put it in a pocket with keys and having the exposed grills get scratched,5
7779,the dual ports in this iflash make it really easy to grip the phone it feels much better,5
7780,that aside for the price it doesn't get any better than that,5
7781,this is an excellent case and i've had zero damage,5
7782,will take getting use to as it's a little big for the phone but it still maintains a sleekness,5
7783,it served it's purpose well and it's too bad no one else had picked up on it yet,5
7784,i was a little worried about whether or not it would fit the phone with that case on,5
7785,the case looks really nice for the price and you'll be glad you took the time and minimal expense,5
7786,charged my phone from 58 % to 100 % in less than 2 hours the phone was fully charged after a 20 minute drive,5
7787,i'm horrible at installing screen protectors but this one works just fine with my iphone 4s,5
7788,i purchased the armband to listen to music on my commutes and this has been an excellent cover,5
7789,arrived on time and it was excatally what i wanted love the colors and also it is very easy to snap on,5
7790,i've never actually timed it but it seems like the material will last longer,5
7791,if you need a mount for your phone this is the case for you,5
7792,5 amp if it isn't a small plug and the prongs do not fold down nor is there a prong cover,5
7793,pretty awesome feel to it and it's been great,5
7794,it is really compact in size but don't let the inside of the phone get wet,5
7795,excellent product we have a few of these zebra cases and i love that i have a second charging cable,5
7796,i recamend getting this case but it is a little hard to use but i d still fine,5
7797,this has yet to irk me but i think it might be a little easier to pull out of my pocket,5
7798,my only hope is they come out with a small in the part that goes in the phone is flexible,5
7799,it feels super nice and isn't too bulky this is a great choice especially for the price,5
7800,i love the trident case its not to big just wish it had a visual battery indicator instead of a audio indicator,5
7801,however every once in a while would fall off the windshield but i believe the problem is with aftermarket cables,5
7802,i have used my hyperion gs3 4200mah extended battery for months and it has held up well over the years too,5
7803,made well and keeps my phone slim and not bulky,5
7804,i purchased a few different colors because i like it so much that i bought 3 refills for it which arrived today,5
7805,the note offers the s-pen which is really nice for my touchscreen oh and the material does not seem cheap,5
7806,i leave the charging ports facing out so i never have to worry about my screen getting effed up so i'm good,5
7807,the uni ax series charger is a great device to keep in your car,5
7808,i am one of the lucky folks who have been complaining about the installation process and the poor fit,5
7809,it's well made and protects my phone love the case and green is my favorite color and i have a few,5
7810,it fits perfectly all cutouts are precise and i really like the cutout on the mite button,5
7811,for your time and money you might be better off using a bluetooth headset to avoid the problem,5
7812,the makers sent me this unit for review but would not hesitate to buy anything from them,5
7813,i am careful with the clips as they don't look like they will fall apart if you breathe too hard around them,5
7814,the lanyard is about two feet long and the micro usb connector is long enough that can fit into your pocket,5
7815,unless you have andre the giant hands you probably wont be able to put this on my new phone and good service,5
7816,many people seem to have problems with the swivel belt clip,5
7817,my s4active-samsung fits in its decorative case so i don't keep cash in it anymore,5
7818,i wasn't going to be using it for an extended period with no discomfort,5
7819,i'll definitely be back to let you know if it's engaged and working,5
7820,update bumper case is still in great shape and works great,5
7821,however i believe that the price is a little much but i guess it's nice to have the resource available,5
7822,the price was right so i decided it was time to look for a mirror,5
7823,i did however have a problem getting it on my phone,5
7824,i have not tried it with any tablets but i would say it increases the size by about 25-30 %,5
7825,it slides unobstrusively on the sun visor and it turns itself on and off automatically when placed or removed from the charger,5
7826,i have checked this out with my cover and i really can't see double the value in the apple product,5
7827,it has amazing built quality for such a low price if you are looking for a very short connector,5
7828,ipad iphone android and my blackberry 9900 all charge fine all at the same time under 4 hrs without any problems,5
7829,my friends love to take lots of pictures on my phone and my tablet at the same time,5
7830,long story short the glue sits to the side and i am really not missing it,5
7831,sure it adds bulk and weight to the phone but in the end it's a snap,5
7832,you can use your own supplied usb cable that came with my old samsung galaxy captivate phone,5
7833,the day i received the screen protectors i also received an email from the company checking on my satisfaction and asking for a review,5
7834,now all i have to do is place my phone on the platform and it recharges my iphone5s,5
7835,i ordered several of these for all the devices i own i can never have too many iphone ipod tablet cell phone cables,5
7836,this is really nice phone and i like it very much as it does not increase the size and weight of the charger,5
7837,but it is very stylish and it feels very nice in your hand very sturdy and something you can easily grip,5
7838,what a great phone i know this because i haven't been keeping exact count,5
7839,the product works great and lasts a very long time and the sound quality is good,5
7840,i use it with a galaxy s3 ipad nexus 7 and it works very well i can recommend it highly,5
7841,i was so impressed by the quality i am going to order a couple more colors now for variety,5
7842,i was able to charge my iphone 4s from 16 % to 100 % in less than a minute,5
7843,the clip is way too large for me to fit in my purse,5
7844,38 thickand i can confirm that the infuse fits inside this case with a little stretch which is fine by me,5
7845,the twist pen is helpful when i need to actually use a device while it's charging through the overnighter,5
7846,i have tried several protectors and i have never found any that do a good job get these,5
7847,it also comes with something you don't see very often in a company,5
7848,it is amazing and i love how it resembles an otterbox commuter case with a koolpad wireless charger,5
7849,the only gripe i have of this product is that you can not use it for my intended purpose,5
7850,don't waste 80 for the same size extended battery it can't get better for the price and there is a 8,5
7851,i do too if i need to i will buy from this seller again and nice delivery service,5
7852,the experience is not quite stock ics but it comes pretty close and it's a nice looking case cover to boot,5
7853,the adjustable clips are the top and bottom are open so i have full access to all my side buttons and my screen,5
7854,there are no instructions given with the device but it still charges just fine,5
7855,just like it came out of the packaging and it is very strong and well made,5
7856,i've been using this for a few months and so far have had no issues,5
7857,i've dropped this from five feet high and the phone was in great condition,5
7858,no down time great base charger and an additional battery and had the same experience on her phone,5
7859,with 200 reviews already posted there's not much i don't like about the samsung galaxy siii and now this for the htc one,5
7860,i love it it works so good i ordered a black one for my husband before he even owned the galaxy note 2,5
7861,was a little hesitant at first but once i put it on the charger when using gps,5
7862,i also love the fact that i can use this with my wife's iphone 4 connected to the other,5
7863,it is strong and durable and i don't think i will order it again,5
7864,finally a battery that holds a charge a long time even with regular use,5
7865,this is an official samsung battery so there are no worries about breaking your phone from dropping it,5
7866,niece chose the rating she was very happy with this case protects well and stays on great,5
7867,i needed a replacement for the one that came with my phone,5
7868,charging a tablet for a quick start was about the same as that with my apple brand charger,5
7869,i am very pleased with this battery it is exactly as described charges fast and works as it should,5
7870,also it has a right angle jack which is good because it meant i didn't have to pay for,5
7871,it's blah with the case on but this is not enough of a problem to drop a star,5
7872,this saved him from having to buy a new one i finally broke down and got the wife one,5
7873,i have had this phone for just over 2 weeks and i haven't had an issue yet,5
7874,pros i like the retro look of the radio and it fits really well and is nice an snug,5
7875,like the video says you can move it around even after it's on your phone it is very useful,5
7876,elago makes a 500 ma version this one is the right price for a simple device like this,5
7877,the screen protector feels fine to the touch and does a great job preventing slips of the phone,5
7878,price was good got it for my delivery driver he loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iphone 5,5
7879,saved myself a ton of money and he was able to pill the second piece off so it is now clear,5
7880,but my case is perfect if my case was to wear like some of the other rubbery feeling shields,5
7881,good to use when you only need your i d and credit cards together with my phone,5
7882,despite its small size thats enough energy to charge an iphone 5s from 0-100 approximately 5 times,5
7883,i removed the size adapter and it fits my phone perfectly and looks good,5
7884,i like that the speakers are on the front which gives you the ability to create but not save a custom preset,5
7885,these work great and are easy to put on and take off,5
7886,this might not be a speaker an audiophile would choose but it is an excellent value considering the prices of the otterbox cases,5
7887,the power volume buttons are a little hard to use but i d still fine,5
7888,lt 3-the over-ear concept is either too new to me i don't do mac neither but this phone really suprised me,5
7889,this cable does not work with the iphone 4s because it doesn't have noticeable air bubbles or rainbow things,5
7890,the longer length is appreciated and it is easier to use something a little more substantial like a credit card,5
7891,i love that it has one port i can use for my wife's iphone 4s twice each before we were able to drain it,5
7892,had bought one of these a couple of years back and it's still installed,5
7893,works really well with the lg 840 g fits nicely and the material has a soft feel but it seems quite durable,5
7894,the tpu gel case is thick enough to protect the phablet,5
7895,it fits very well and is easy to get my phone out of the otterbox,5
7896,would highly recommend you are in the hunt for a new battery for her,5
7897,the material isn't leather but doesn't look cheap or anything like some other reviews,5
7898,also the imp90c is cheaper than buying a whole new case and saves money,5
7899,super cute and it fits my phone perfectly and is easy to take off when needed,5
7900,i'm 100 % satisfied even with the price it's a steal at what it costs,5
7901,very good fit and lots of them if you make a mistake and ruin a piece which is very easy to find the button,5
7902,it's a cute silicone case so it's not that sticky rubber junk,5
7903,the only downside is that you have to push a button to read the level,5
7904,i'm just waiting to see if anyone has tried to contact you,5
7905,i have the neo hybrid on my iphone 5 i have a kayscase tpu case on it and my i d perfectly,5
7906,but i don't think it will be a very good back up cover i wished i bought a few more,5
7907,this product reaches in past your case allowing you to charge and check your phone without lifting a finger,5
7908,i love the chargers and have already recommended them to others with the same phone and the one that came with my galaxy s4,5
7909,that's not a complaint just a side effect of the self-healing is a strange rippling action,5
7910,i wasn't to sure of the fit at first but it went on with very few bubbles that he removed easily,5
7911,i've put it on and taken it off many times from my dash and it still sticks with no problems,5
7912,i've been using this for a couple days i like it better than the surface case,5
7913,he has dropped the phone multiple times and the case has not cracked and my phone has not been damaged,5
7914,i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review,5
7915,i was a bit concerned that the sensitivity wouldn't be as good as headphones it is a great option to have,5
7916,the best ear pods buds so far that i have bought to allow me to do that,5
7917,need some time to get used to it and it doesn't bother the screen performance,5
7918,i use this when i use my iphone as my car's gps,5
7919,we installed the receiver inside my daughter's iphone 5s it plugs into the phone so the connection stays solid while she's driving,5
7920,mind you for the price i'd highly recommend this,5
7921,i looked at several but this plantronics m50 seemed to have the best features and reviews for under 30 shipped bt headset,5
7922,you double press the on button to turn the flashlight on and off push the power button twice and voila you have a flashlight,5
7923,this phone is by far the best bang for my buck,5
7924,the really great part about it is that you have a built-in microphone and you can answer calls directly from it,5
7925,99 and it's not that much bigger and i'd rather have it keep ticking than be thin and elegant,5
7926,it won't slip off on it's own or arrived that way,5
7927,i really love hello kitty and all the accessories that are available for this phone were as good as this one,5
7928,glad this pack came with 3 because i returned my phone soon after,5
7929,i goofed on the screen protector and back apple screen as well as the rest of the phone,5
7930,my daughter was very pleased i would recommend this company to order from if anyone asks,5
7931,i ordered this to make it easier to put it on,5
7932,the anti-fingerprinting is something i didn't really think about during my initial writing,5
7933,i've read that the battery is supposed to last up to six hours,5
7934,this cover looks great feels great and is a great quality for what i paid for i give it a 5 star rating,5
7935,6 amps needs 1 amp at least to charge at a fast rate i did not need something for syncing data just charging,5
7936,i decided to take a chance after watching the review on this product you probably need this product,5
7937,volume is fairly loud as so far i didn't have to put it on a charger it took about 6 hours to fully charge,5
7938,unfortunately i wrote my first review and i was contacted by the company now hows that for customer service,5
7939,i ruined too many compact headsets over the years and they are all very solid products,5
7940,i was confused on how long to charge it i thought it would ruin the quality of the screen,5
7941,traveling is a goodidea with this as you never know when you're going to need a lot of use from this device,5
7942,as long as it doesn't have a case on the phone,5
7943,my wife has the htc droid dna and it works like it should it is a good charger,5
7944,these cases are worth the wait trust me when you get them you find the edges of the case tend to smudge on screen,5
7945,we are overall very happy with this purchase and will be buying more for friends as they like mine,5
7946,i am also happy that i was able to use my aftermarket headphones without needing the adaptor,5
7947,it is very reassuring to me that when i am away from a charger and does it well,5
7948,bottom line if your going to use both will need to get a bulkier case specifically designed for that,5
7949,i just ordered another one to keep as a spare in case your apple cable gets lost,5
7950,are exposed properly and it even has a handy led light although it's not that bright but great if you are in a hurry,5
7951,i like the fact that the 2 usp ports and the charging port are big which is a very good design,5
7952,with her standard battery it would last an hour or so longer than the stock battery that came with my phone,5
7953,i likd it so well that i purchased two others,5
7954,assuming you use a case on the back and has to get cleaned often,5
7955,jabra has quickly become my go-to set up for travel,5
7956,1 amps to use in my car and i am always ready to charge any of my phones within the last 3-4 years,5
7957,i've used the case for more than two months with my galaxy note 3 n9000,5
7958,well it really boost the look of my phone so i don't use it to listen to podcast music and video downloads,5
7959,the silvery plastic border on this device looks and feels like it is built to last a lot longer,5
7960,great protection i have dropped my phone several times with no damage to the iphone,5
7961,easy to pair easy to use and the price is right,5
7962,again it provides not a lot of protection on the front it's ideal for what i wanted,5
7963,really protect my phone i have dropped it quite a few times but since the edges of the case tend to smudge on screen,5
7964,i enjoyed them and got what i was expecting no more no less,5
7965,this case fits the galaxy nexus well doesn't pick up lint or turn pockets inside out,5
7966,fits great easy to put on and protects the screen because it comes up around the front and back edges to protect it,5
7967,i was shocked when i paired this with my phone and it remembers it and syncs every time,5
7968,i'm happy to say it fits very tight and is protective,5
7969,i have had all the different charging cases for the iphone 5 already and my favorite is the candyshell once again,5
7970,call quality is great i cant tell the difference between this and the genuine apple version,5
7971,i still can get two days but it won't go into the details it's just simple,5
7972,by charging my nexus device i am able to charge my phone twice,5
7973,i added a clip-on holder to it and found it to be the most comfortable bluetooth headset that i've tried,5
7974,to combat this i always check to see if the total charge time slowed down,5
7975,it's a solid purchase and i would recommend it to everyone that likes rhinestone diamonds,5
7976,i received very fast customer service and they are sending me a free replacement under their warrantee terms,5
7977,either can charge an iphone or similar device at least twice,5
7978,the only remaining problem i had was that it did not have any tiny scratch while using the included plastic bubble remover,5
7979,i had a friend call me to test those features and i was able to use my ipad while it charges,5
7980,a note on price i could not find a better option,5
7981,it doesn't vibrate much and you can easily adjust the viewing angle too to minimize glare,5
7982,despite all the rave reviews the performance from my battery wasn't much better than what it had been in the past,5
7983,the second time i held the phone in place even when i pulled a bit on cables that were attached,5
7984,i will recommend this to family and friends if you're looking for the original usb 3,5
7985,i use my smart phone for a wide variety of phones including the iphone and i wouldn't trade this case for no other,5
7986,the snap on the flap is very secure and will not let your phone drop easily,5
7987,it's thin and has almost the same size of the protector that makes it hard to see which is which,5
7988,this really doesn't have anything to do with the quality or functionality of this unit,5
7989,all of these were so cute and i love the lights on it,5
7990,the usb ports are high powered unlike most other dual usb car chargers that over promise and under delivery,5
7991,also feels very sturdy unlike a lot of bluetooth headsets and this one is the best,5
7992,okay so the point of writing this review is to point out that she didn't have any problems after that,5
7993,it looks to be of good quality and a good feel in your hands,5
7994,the fewer stupid wall warts i can deal with the sound not being perfect,5
7995,the magnetic hold isn't strong enough to keep you awake,5
7996,the only improvement i would make is to have a power bank backup charger in my bag,5
7997,i got this to go with my charging station and it is a perfect case which i really like,5
7998,i was always inadvertently pressing the volume or power button wouldn't go in right,5
7999,found this case and figured for the price i'll be getting another one,5
8000,it feels good on the hand and i like that the case isn't clear or so they thought,5
8001,i think i have to say that i'm a moderate to heavy user,5
8002,i'm not exactly sure when i bought this product i kept shocking myself with my plug in earphones,5
8003,i would definitively recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a dual usb charger,5
8004,it's as substantial as the one from apple at about 1 3 of an ounce you hardly know it's there,5
8005,we are very happy that it came very fast i didn't have to go through the process with a pin number,5
8006,i ordered this to give to a friend who is in love with hello kitty anything and she loves this,5
8007,but it also makes the phone easier to hang on to,5
8008,it looks great does not add much bulk to your phone,5
8009,this is the third bluetooth receiver i've tried on my iphone and it works great,5
8010,with this in mind nothing to worry about the screen getting scratched on the table,5
8011,avoid investing in the 34 lame 34 lifeproof case for the iphone 4 4s that i have bought and it is great,5
8012,not as durable as an otterbox case but it's everything i wanted in my s4 case 1,5
8013,they cover the entire front of the phone which i also like but it has no kickstand and cost more,5
8014,this belkin case is the best i have seen yet,5
8015,i bought this for my iphone 5 and it fits in the mount just fine,5
8016,i think i'll order more to keep in the car so i can charge my phone in any outlet anywhere i go,5
8017,invisible shield is the only screen protector i've ever bought tough clear and easy to install,5
8018,i have a fundamental aversion to talking on the phone while doing stuff around the house,5
8019,btw i haven't had any issues with humidity inside the pack but i'm not a fan of big bulky heavy cases,5
8020,first off i love hello kitty and when i saw this koala be i just had to have it,5
8021,and importantly i can see the phone and the power volume buttons are fully covered while still having a nice tactile response,5
8022,it's a clear screen protector and doesn't form bubbles so easily,5
8023,this is by far the easiest case to put on and take off but won't fall off,5
8024,i used the phone as i normally do an alarm clock,5
8025,this is not something i have been able to charge kindles and ipads,5
8026,i haven't found anything yet that it won't charge the samsun or asus tablets,5
8027,one thing that i love is that this bluetooth headset can be paired with two different bluetooth devices if you want to use headphones,5
8028,on top of this they come with a lifetime warranty i feel like it's well protected,5
8029,which is important if you need to take your office in the road,5
8030,my original charger broke so this was a perfect replacement for one that had broken,5
8031,the mount holds the phone rock-solid and the phone doesn't slide out of my hand,5
8032,for the price i paid less this way and the screen quality is great works just like new,5
8033,music sounds fine or as fine as can be expected from a little gizmo like this,5
8034,the pen writes really well and although it seemed a bit on the small side on my hands but it was 100 % worth it,5
8035,super basss is excellent but don't know how to interact with it by default,5
8036,it keeps my phone in one place and charging if needed,5
8037,although i would have loved to have a way to use your phone while using the case,5
8038,not that i really want to hold a conversation there but hey it's a really good quality i recommend this case to all,5
8039,the speaker comes with an adapter that plugs into a wall socket and five ports await,5
8040,you supply the usb cables for your device and plug them into the car and you're good to go,5
8041,in fact it sticks so well that it's hard to make out what it being said,5
8042,i take it with me every time i travel with friends,5
8043,my dad loves it and it keeps his phone protected yet all the buttons are easily accessible,5
8044,unboxing the package is clean and clear with a crisp bass,5
8045,my wife got the same phone as me i would have just preferred the memory card to be included,5
8046,oh contrary to another reviewers suggestion it will not fit into the hip holster with this cover on,5
8047,i had it on my wish list for a long time because it's all about durability,5
8048,this battery charger is awesome i always have a spare battery with you for that 34 just in case 34 moment,5
8049,ive been using both batteries for about a week and i've gotten to really like it,5
8050,i use it attached to my purse and it still looks brand new i even wash it with soap and water,5
8051,everyone that i have talked to in the last few days and am so thankful for this product and it is as expected,5
8052,the motorola hx550 has a weird deal with fitting into my ear canal and so it helps me hear better while driving,5
8053,this was a gift for my dad and he loves it,5
8054,the wallet looks so much better in person i'm glad i got to choose the color,5
8055,the only way it won't protect your phone against drops but it will protect it from damage if i should drop it,5
8056,4 1 2 starsplease note i received this product for a fair and honest review,5
8057,giving you complete and easy access to the hdmi and the mini usb port,5
8058,these have become my daily headphones and i couldn 8217 t be more pleased with the product and give it my top rating,5
8059,this case was a gift for a friend it does protect the iphone from minor drops and bumps,5
8060,i love this case so much i am going to get the new otterbox case when its out in the market,5
8061,do not leave home without having it in my pocket or bag very easy,5
8062,i haven't dropped it yet so don't know how it is bare but the case itself is worth the price,5
8063,it has a great feel and does not slip out of my hand and crash to the ground,5
8064,a great buy if you want to keep your screen clean and protected,5
8065,a must buy for anyone looking for a way to mount my nexus 5 while driving,5
8066,i'll update if i start to have problems with this one i change phone cases on a regular bases,5
8067,since i have had this case for about 1 week and conditioning battery the battery life is fantastic,5
8068,it's not perfect but it is much easier to line up than the flimsy plastic screen protectors,5
8069,no more messy cords when i'm trying to use with it not the belkin,5
8070,i almost returned this because at first i didn't like the fact that it is pure android and that it get update first,5
8071,i'm still left with c which is that i don't have to take your pocketbook with you just this,5
8072,the battery lasts a long time and its still working perfect,5
8073,the cover easily moves out of theway when you need to charge multiple devices the sanyo charger is the way to go all the way,5
8074,if not used it holds its charge for up to a year,5
8075,i don't really like it but i screwed up the first one but got the second one on good,5
8076,fits the 4s perfectly and it is easy to apply as long as you follow the video guide well,5
8077,fits perfect is very snug it protects my phone from being scrached up while i'm talking on this bluetooth,5
8078,13 its been over a week now and i can definitely tell a difference from my basic screen protector before,5
8079,emma my cat some how got to the front of my jeans waistband so i broke my clip,5
8080,by far the most comfortable to wear device i have ever used even more so than the acase,5
8081,it's great to have if you don't have a huge tangle of cords to worry about on your dash,5
8082,while the camera quality is decent on these products it can be awkward to remove your phone from it's slippery back cover,5
8083,and for that price i am more than happy to write them this review,5
8084,my wife has gone through a few cases for my new s4,5
8085,this screen protector may cost a little more but they are absolutely top quality,5
8086,they are detachable so you can swap out the tip with plugs for micro-usb mini-usb psp and standard apple,5
8087,i like this one for its colors and that it has a higher edge to protect my phone if i drop it,5
8088,i haven't dropped it yet so only time will tell as far as durability on this,5
8089,the film seems to be just a little thicker than desired,5
8090,the design of this product is very good it helps you a lot and the price is very fair and shipping speed was speedy,5
8091,i believe this to be just as good as anything i've worked with,5
8092,this is the 4th otterbox i've bought and this was a gift for my partner and she loves it,5
8093,i was able to charge just my iphone to 100 % and my ipad from 0 to 100 %,5
8094,thes pen works just as well with this case on as without it,5
8095,it took a little longer for this case it was worth it to buy it,5
8096,she have not done so yet but i think this case is an excellent value considering the prices of the otterbox cases,5
8097,you'll need to determine if the extra cost isn't a problem buy the motion,5
8098,i find that i can clip a stylus on the back of the screen protector to fully cover that,5
8099,i suspect it might be difficult to put on and seem to hold up well,5
8100,it doesn't protect the phone very much if you were to drop this from a reasonable distance nothing more,5
8101,bottom line i believe i finally found the perfect case for my iphone 4s,5
8102,it looks like what it was worth and sort of reminds me of the kind of packaging apple sends out,5
8103,i've dropped my phone nokia a few times with the case on and all ports are easily accessible as well as the volume rocker,5
8104,most tablets will get at least 1 full charge with a little juice left over before this needs to be recharged,5
8105,plus it works well as a regular cable but it's perfect for going to and from the office,5
8106,this product is easy to apply and does its job wonderfully,5
8107,so far we have used it to charge my iphone 5 as well as other phones i have,5
8108,even if they break five only cost a couple bucks on amazon if i were to lose it tomorrow i would buy another one anyway,5
8109,i've always purchased expensive screen protectors in the past that were not the color in the pic,5
8110,the soft case protect my phone from getting any dents from falling and i'm sure that a slimmer one oem will do the trick,5
8111,the rhinestones are so blingy and i'm just in love with this case the moment i put it on,5
8112,to start charging your iphone you have to hold the button in order to turn on,5
8113,if you guys are looking for a battery that can last a whole day on one charge even though i usually don't,5
8114,besides the deeply discounted and dependable cell service my favorite feature is the glowing led rim around the unit's outer face,5
8115,these are great for any device that has an audio 3,5
8116,no complaints thus far but i do wish it was a little bit bulkier than the charger it replaced but definitely worth the additional size,5
8117,i purchased this case for my galaxy note2 so i could have easy access to it without taking my eyes off the road,5
8118,my only complaint is that it leaves the top and the bottom areas are totally exposed,5
8119,i've had the cables for a couple of months and i have only used about half of its charge,5
8120,note that the other devices that i have tested this device on two cell phone devices,5
8121,i am so happy with the quality and she loves it,5
8122,i got this one for me and my sister now have matching purses,5
8123,in conclusion i would have to say that this is the best looking and lightest of the ones that work,5
8124,the charger doesn't come with any cables and you can't just slide your phone into that,5
8125,thinking that this was because i didn't want to get a case,5
8126,i had a candyshell case actually two of them and they go on much better than the cheap ones,5
8127,has indicator lights to let you know it is properly connected,5
8128,i have a case for my iphone this product is amazing and there is not a lot of presure,5
8129,since it's suppose to protect the screen from getting scratched its as if the case were molded onto the phone,5
8130,i'm very fussy and this is the 5th case i bought for this phone the included spray bottle pump was bad,5
8131,the phones you are seeing here are just people who've had negative experiences,5
8132,you can charge the case with the headset in it about once a week and the full charge only takes an hour or two,5
8133,i like the hybrid tip better than the rubber tips on other pens i have used,5
8134,i love my samsung galaxy s4 phone and i can pop it out and sit it on my desk while working,5
8135,it's not a huge deal and it's extremely easy to reach all corners of the touchscreen with a thumb,5
8136,now i have four and i can put them in the carry pouch,5
8137,both covers have held up well over the past few weeks i've been researching wireless qi charging,5
8138,well i was wrong it does work well and keeps me totally hands free,5
8139,it looks great with my white iphone and it looks great,5
8140,it is really transparent and does not change the feel of the phone comfortable to carry,5
8141,this is a hard smooth plastic case for the iphone 4s for my wife i was afraid that her galaxy s3 wasn't well protected,5
8142,my old griffin powerduo doesn't work well with the ipad2 and it's higher 10watt requirement,5
8143,the items themselves are great for the price and came very fast,5
8144,mpow's portable backup battery charger is a great device that allows for both talk and listening to music,5
8145,being at some strange angle using it while it is charging without having to pick it up and play with it,5
8146,the galaxy note iii with an otterbox case is a tight fit for my samsung galaxy note 3 with my laptop,5
8147,this price is reasonable and the fit is a little tight but i'm sure they work fine with any bluetooth device,5
8148,the cutouts lined up perfectly with the phone cameras controls etc,5
8149,it's durable functional protects my phone and the screen protector tore on impact with a box,5
8150,in terms of power the unit is relatively compact and easy to take with you on the road,5
8151,the case has great cutouts for all the ports and mics in the correct locations,5
8152,you just have to put a bit of pressure on the volume and sleep buttons easily,5
8153,on the highway it's hard to be able to hear ambient noise while talking,5
8154,a lot of difference in the way it was meant to be it looks perfect with my white iphone,5
8155,also ithas a slick finish that makes it easy to grip and leaves few fingerprints if any,5
8156,this smartphone is really nice it has a really nice feature the jambox is missing,5
8157,also in the lower right of the phone which means that it might still fit in some docks,5
8158,the build in laser pointer is awesome and it feels really good in my ear and other times it really hurts,5
8159,it suits my phone perfectly and it's not slippery,5
8160,s happens but it is a great product and surprisingly light weight,5
8161,1 corner protection all corners of the phone and did not need any additional,5
8162,34 that was with the charger it came with is ok but not high amperage,5
8163,it it not actually in the way of anything unlike my old bulky charger,5
8164,the best way for me is to turn off bluetooth on the phone and press the jabra button and you are pretty much done,5
8165,it's not the smooth leather i was expecting but im not worried about my brand new phone breaking at all anymore,5
8166,if you have this sanyo unit just plug it into your computer with a standard usb to mini-usb cable,5
8167,i find the screen size a definite positive it makes surfing the web and watching movies a joy on the giant vivid screen,5
8168,this is one mammoth of a battery and it will turn your phone into a brick but offers some protection from short falls,5
8169,the following morning i used it to re-charge my iphone ipad or other device that charges my phone,5
8170,sound quality is great for a unit about the size of a matchbox or a box of gum you might purchase,5
8171,don't think it'll survive in the texas heat but so far so good and i intend to keep it that way,5
8172,this arrived on time and it fit perfectly with all cut outs fitting perfectly,5
8173,i had bought a smaller anker product before and it always had a charge on a plane in a restaurant in a car etc,5
8174,i like the fact that it doesn't sit properly in my dock,5
8175,it also has covers for the headphone input as well as the cable that came with the power pack it worked perfectly,5
8176,at its current 30 price tag i don't think you could find a better cable at the price,5
8177,glass screen protectors are amazing because you don't have to flip open the case to a screen clean and clear of finger prints,5
8178,the battery comes with easy directions on how to get the job done as quickly as possible,5
8179,i do usually charge the ipad when it is in the bumper and would work well with pretty much any other brand as well,5
8180,otherwise this battery pack is one of the newest phones available and this is a perfect example as to why,5
8181,if you're looking for flashy or 34 blingy 34 this is not for you though since it is a little bulky,5
8182,fingernail or something like that it leaves indentations that don't seem to go away and makes the screen look horrible,5
8183,i like it its a good case and slimmer than the otterbox commuter series,5
8184,it is very bulky but my phone didn't that is the main thing,5
8185,that is very very frustrating but the cable is well made and the kickstand is a lovely addition,5
8186,it holds your phone very well keep it protected you don't have to carry a purse all the time,5
8187,unmounting can be done one-handed as well but to keep the phone from slipping out of my hand especially if they are wet,5
8188,bought this as a gift so i am not sure how it would look on a black iphone but with the white it looks great,5
8189,i love this now this is the best case i have ever owned,5
8190,they both charge well though i will most likely be purchasing another one of these or any product from anker,5
8191,it comes with very short charging cables to charge my devices really great product and a great price,5
8192,they are comfortable or at least after a couple of days i was fine with the design,5
8193,the tekkeon has a standard usb-a connector on one end and a ball pen on the other end,5
8194,i have dropped it a few times and each time it still adhered perfectly no bubbles perfect clarity,5
8195,i use acase-mate tortoiseshell case for apple iphone 5 blackand am happy with the amount of customization you can do,5
8196,i wish belkin made this for my galaxy note phone and android tablet,5
8197,the head doesn't pivot as much as i would like but it solid in the hand and verizon is way better than sprint,5
8198,guess they download a lot of apps that i find useful and i am a heavy phone user,5
8199,i have not experienced any muffled or garbled conversations and i have not had any issues running out of battery,5
8200,i am only on 4th day with it and i am very impressed with this case when it arrived,5
8201,i like the style and rugged features of this phone case better than some of the more expensive wired headphones that i have,5
8202,the price was great so much cheaper than the price at the store,5
8203,even though it's a little tall the quality of the case is very good and very easy to assemble,5
8204,at about 3 years old the battery in my phone is a little more than 3000mah,5
8205,having tried many types and brands of screen protectors on my iphones over the years,5
8206,nfc google wallet capable ravpower 3200mah li-ion battery for samsung exhibit 4 g t759 exhibit,5
8207,can't beat it for what you are getting as well,5
8208,it works good i have had it for a couple of seconds turns the device off,5
8209,this little and i do mean little guy has a rechargeable battery that charges with a standard mini usb cable included,5
8210,replacing the lcd was not difficult with the help of a paperclip i was able to get all my work done remotely,5
8211,and any time i need to change the battery if needed,5
8212,very cute and flexible all my friends and family members than i call,5
8213,definitely not for me i got this for my aunt and little cousin they love them,5
8214,the case is easy to put on take off when needed,5
8215,the charger is small and you can keep it with the car charger,5
8216,i love mine and couldn't be more pleased with the final product,5
8217,my iphone broke so i bought this to have a stand for my phone,5
8218,it makes it easy to connect to the internet however you can just use the usb lead which came with your device,5
8219,i love how it has the cut out for the camera flash and speaker openings the best,5
8220,mar 2014 i leave it in my car so i can use it any country i go and so far so good,5
8221,if you are looking for a high quality car mount for my iphone 5,5
8222,this case is very nice i really love it and would order similar items in the future,5
8223,i recommend this case and i will definitely be sticking with this brand for my all my future screen protector needs,5
8224,i recomend this product but you can not use the camera with flash at night inside this case,5
8225,i initially bought this for my mom because she wanted a case that was inexpensive and had a low profile,5
8226,i use this to watch my movies on my ipad when i am watching a movie on my kindle more comfortable and enjoyable,5
8227,i love this thing so much i had to buy the red case separately,5
8228,my friend like it so much had to get one for my new note 3,5
8229,it fit my iphone and now it fits my galaxy s3 perfect have been asked where i got it all the time,5
8230,case seems well sealed and protective though i have not tried it with any other browsers as opera is a good browser,5
8231,i like to feel this case it's very well worth the money and works perfectly with my galaxy siii,5
8232,these feel sturdy and you can tell it is hand made,5
8233,i have a jell cover so i don't have to keep you phone plugged in,5
8234,this case is also easy to take off and put on so for those who don't like charging their phone during the day,5
8235,otterbox is the best in the market otterbox defender is the best case for the money,5
8236,i was sick of my jabra earpiece either falling off my ear not loud enough or just yuppy junk,5
8237,1a port to charge my ipad in the car with no problems,5
8238,i had to use my own 30pin converter to the iphone 5 but does make it easier to hold onto,5
8239,the charger is great as it can charge spare batteries for other phones before and i can't even tell you have headphones on,5
8240,i don't think i've ever seen this one comes with a multipurpose cord and adapters,5
8241,the amount of time it took to charge the power bank and compatible mobile devices,5
8242,i have to admit i was a bit leery ordering this because of the price and the tpu material,5
8243,i love the retractable cord and take it with me to work and school,5
8244,it's easy to apply and you get two for a very good price,5
8245,and it covers the back and the edges of the phone real well,5
8246,non-the-less i can still see my cover with it on,5
8247,i wouldn't go throwing your phone across the room but it should be safe with the occasional slip and fall,5
8248,75 oz compact 2 x 2 x 1 small enough to fit in a pocket,5
8249,this is much quicker than the apple charger that comes with the phone,5
8250,it does what it says it does i highly recommend this to anyone buying a secondary charger,5
8251,this case is still slim enough to keep it from being damaged,5
8252,tapping the button on the headset and you're talking on the phone and have lasted a while,5
8253,as other reviewers have mentioned the case does not have one scratch mark on it,5
8254,this was purchased for my wife's android phone and i use it all the time,5
8255,it is running ics and im waiting for one for my moms g2,5
8256,the power on off switch is on the side of the power bank to begin charging your device just plug it in the charging begins,5
8257,i like and would purchase it again in a heartbeat,5
8258,the first one stopped working within a month and anker sent me out a replacement phone but didn't send a new battery,5
8259,yet this is a very slim case and fits the phone very well and all the cutouts line up perfectly where they should,5
8260,however it is still a great case and i've been using the iphone 4 at t perfectly,5
8261,how did it take so long for someone to figure out a way to use one for something else and make it work,5
8262,i really like this screen protector because the case doesn't cover the hardware mechanical buttons or no case at all,5
8263,why i'm giving this a 5 star because i did not have to contact the seller,5
8264,this is a exact fit for the note 2 and the only thing i regret is not getting one sooner,5
8265,i gave full 5 star because it is a great little device to charge two items,5
8266,bought it to replace the battery that came with my phone that i keep plugged into an outlet in the kitchen,5
8267,it's better than other bt headsets i've used and i must say it was a solid purchase,5
8268,99 and it does exactly what i want it to do keep my evo running longer,5
8269,the anti-glare anti-fingerprint screen protectors that fit perfectly on my samasung galaxys 4,5
8270,granted it would take a long time to charge and my samsung galaxy siii fits perfectly into the holder with the adjustable clips,5
8271,did a lot of research on this phone and a few things that they did nt,5
8272,the product was delivered with a 55 % charge and an ipad 2 about a 50 % charge on it,5
8273,i've been using the titan for just over a month now and my husband has the same device,5
8274,music streaming sounds great and i can imagine this is great for those days where you don't have acess to a dc current,5
8275,the day it arrived my iphone 4s got damaged and i replaced it with a small craft braces style rubber band and it works fine,5
8276,it is used with an iphone and believe it or not the bass it puts out is pretty good too,5
8277,i like this car charger works perfect with my iphone 5 i got this version and i'm super happy with it,5
8278,tested both batteries they are almost as good as my nexus7 1st gen tablet,5
8279,i love that case that case probably won't work with newer ipads which seem to demand a high amp charger,5
8280,i know it's an otterbox but i was looking for something a little slimmer and not so bulky,5
8281,this unit has a softish rubbery type of plastic on the inside of the handle to answer or end calls,5
8282,after reading numerous good reviews for this product i reluctantly purchased a pair,5
8283,i think i had the same brand before but not one that i could listen to my music in my truck,5
8284,very comfortable and i wear for stretches up to an hour but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who needs a protector,5
8285,it's so cute and doesn't interfere with any of the touch capabilities which is a bonus,5
8286,after that i put the new sim in the iphone 5 and it is even easier to apply,5
8287,i believe that would be one of the best cases in the world,5
8288,but like i said it won't hold your phone if it has a thick or any,5
8289,keeps it protected and i will recommend it to all my family and friends,5
8290,if anything goes wrong with the one i currently have which is the spigen sgp ultra nano,5
8291,heck you don't even need to carry a separate pen,5
8292,the extra bulk doesn't bother me much just wish i didn't have to unplug my dash cam to do it,5
8293,i can't believe i didn't know about from reading the description,5
8294,fits well and is exactly what i paid for a brand new phone and it is faster and smoother that it ever was stock,5
8295,but it's definitely faster than plugging it into the wall and it read % 001 charge which seemed odd,5
8296,based on other user reviews i thought i would give them another shot with my nexus 5,5
8297,it feels great in my hands and i love the color,5
8298,come on it's a piece of junk but this is a good thing to buy a screen protector from them for an additional 15,5
8299,the extra length makes it easy to charge your devices while on the road es with a two-year warranty,5
8300,the games play super fast the keyboard is not quite as good as my bb was speed blazingly fast,5
8301,i go on runs and work out 4 times a week and hasn't had any problems with anything coming off,5
8302,but this one by far is the best looking case in the 10 range,5
8303,6 amps the first necessary for more power hungry devices like the ipad the other is 1 a and is for phones,5
8304,i have a corolla 02 just in case people are wondering this is for the sprint network,5
8305,be patient this step takes a lot of work to pop off accidentally,5
8306,i ordered this unit as a replacement and it has not let me down,5
8307,for those high-power devices a charger with a higher watt amp rating does not charge your phone any faster,5
8308,the plastic that holds the phone and i have no complains in fact i will be purchasing more colors soon,5
8309,so if you have to remove the case to use the adapter,5
8310,i like the fact that i can use it to chat hands free,5
8311,it makes it harder for people to hear you speak on the phone,5
8312,i previously had an i-blason bumper case but it is still pretty,5
8313,it holds the phone by leather tabs at the top and the bottom seem sized to give just enough protection without being bulky,5
8314,i use this in my car and use it to charge my two cellphones samsung a galaxy note 2 and it works well,5
8315,i would buy this in the future if i had need of another,5
8316,if you have trouble putting them on just watch a few youtube videos this thing should get you through the day,5
8317,this was the first case i bought and i'm glad i did,5
8318,the edges are slightly raised to keep your phone elevated in case of a drop but i knew this when ordering,5
8319,it took 3 hours and 43 minutes to charge my nexus 4 without putting much of a dent in it's capaicity,5
8320,my daughter is completely satisfy with the way it fits so snug on her note 2,5
8321,love the bright color and the accurate fit of this case for my son when he broke his phone charger one,5
8322,i've never had any problem with ravpower products over the past year and i have to say that this is my favorite thus far,5
8323,i laid the screen protector on the phone at all,5
8324,there are two speakers inside and i wish i could fine a package like this again,5
8325,the case wraps all the way around with this purchase,5
8326,if there was one gripe i have with this phone is speaker is on the back and can give pretty decent volume,5
8327,i used the mini this morning to charge my phone now i'll be able to plug into just about anything,5
8328,i love this case i have bought this for my other phone note 3 and still love it,5
8329,2 films to remove that are labeled 1 and 2 however you won't need to be tied to a wall outlet,5
8330,there is actually one frustration point i have with this case is it has a small lip on the front to protect the glass,5
8331,i am very pleased with the case and would recommend to anyone looking for smart phone to consider buying this,5
8332,i know the s4 has been out for a while already and is still selling like hotcakes,5
8333,note that no charging cables are included with the charger so you'll need to provide your own cables,5
8334,some of it's unique features are that it has a built-in micro usb cable and one black usb x micro usb cable,5
8335,the phone has quite a solid feel to it and the buttons volume power work well under their protective covers,5
8336,when people use their phone gps it's usually on the seat next to me and the blueant in my ear,5
8337,good and flexible i purchased this to add qi wireless charging to your galaxy s4,5
8338,1 amps if it is the only device plugged into the charger in your purse car pocket etc,5
8339,it has a red led ring along the outer edge to let you know that the unit is correctly plugged in,5
8340,i have also used it in my car with temps around 100 ambient outside,5
8341,the charger itself is small and can easily be carried in a purse knapsack or briefcase,5
8342,i have dropped my phone several times and it has not cracked or broken at all,5
8343,i have used this for over 4 months with no problem,5
8344,the screen protectors are a bit more of a bright pink than a muted pink,5
8345,9830 very rigid and can be difficult to put on but equally happy with it,5
8346,yes we did throw it across the room into a wall,5
8347,it's way to hard to find a good quality micro-usb charge sync cable,5
8348,i would not be able to get one to fit the note 2 but this case protected the phone very well,5
8349,i did not use it for a few days so i dont know if thats normal but seems slightly slow,5
8350,for quality like that i would have expected to have paid much more for screen protector but these do the job just as well,5
8351,it's assymmetrical enough for me to be able to watch it easily with out it falling over,5
8352,mine is the same thickness as the evo lte with the phone in a handbag tote or pocket,5
8353,i used to charge every other day or so i have to make sure my cases are easy for me to use,5
8354,like other ottetboxes i've owned this one is the most comfortable i have ever use,5
8355,this case is very slim and is easy to put on and it is easy to use with the holster,5
8356,i had used the otterbox defender series on my phones so i decided to try a new battery,5
8357,first thing i noticed when i picked up the phone and not even the case was marred,5
8358,0 and it supports hsp hfp and a2dp protocols you can also listen to the mp3 player on your phone through this bluetooth,5
8359,i've been using an otterbox commuter case and that works fine as well,5
8360,it will hold for about 8 months and it works great,5
8361,i purchased another case that did not fit properly so they offered me a full refund,5
8362,i charged the speaker's internal battery can be recharged through a usb port of a pc,5
8363,there is an optional app that you can download so your text messages will be read to you through the freeway,5
8364,lastly i actually dropped my phone with the hard case and there is little drop protection,5
8365,this unit is comfortable to hold and easy to hang onto,5
8366,with this i am keeping my driver's license in the case and cash in your pocket,5
8367,it also consistently provides fast charging on my nexus 7 tablet and my phone two at a time,5
8368,the micro-usb port exposed as well as the back camera flash and mic,5
8369,with the proliferation of great mobile devices like the iphone 4s and the galaxy nexus with no problem,5
8370,i'm rather careful with my phone but i do read so the little stand is a little cheesy but functional,5
8371,i have this for a travel phone and don't have to hold it for 1 2 or 3 seconds,5
8372,it comes with this nifty 34 dust removal tape 34 insures that the screen is perfectly clean,5
8373,the hard snap on case covers the entire back and most of the sides of the case offer a good grip when using the phone,5
8374,i think for the price is really good she saw the same one at another store for 6x's the price,5
8375,paired with a screen protector my advice would be to just order a better screen saver right away,5
8376,additional widget apps tend to be large and i don't want people to know who's calling you,5
8377,i can get about 4-5 charges for my iphone 5 and i absolutely love it so much,5
8378,i have been using it with no problem thank you,5
8379,people didn't say i can't hear you very well on the phone,5
8380,the iphone screen shipped fast got it in 2 days and it is in perfect condition just how it looks on the phone,5
8381,the screen protector is amazing and the customer service from tech armor is one of the best devices i have ever bought,5
8382,i recieve many compliments on it and everyone wants to know where he came from,5
8383,and yes there are still some minor things that can be improved are the poly-carbonate cover,5
8384,i don't know if there is a difference between the 2 cables i think,5
8385,plus this thing is tiny thought it would be a huge step down in terms of quality an dependability,5
8386,then i tested it by placing my old phone inside submerging it in water and also dropped it out of a 2 story window,5
8387,these are just as good as the oem car charger and it's an oem,5
8388,no more switch microphone necessary to turn on and off just slide the boom closed,5
8389,inexpensivecons it gets pretty hot when charging both my ipad and iphone however this did not affect the responsiveness of the touchscreen and capacitive buttons,5
8390,i have gotten tons of compliments and everyone asks me where it i buy this i will buy some more for my family,5
8391,well the screen protector is a bit on the chintzy side,5
8392,i have never dropped my phone so i can't speak to those,5
8393,if you are travelling and don't want to take chances with it falling out,5
8394,i'm not particular about this so i don't think anyone actually needs it,5
8395,i've been playing around with it but haven't had time to fully go through everything this phone has to offer,5
8396,not much more to say about this phone so i'll only write about the things that are important to me,5
8397,i got this due to owning the new google play galaxy s4 and this fits my phone well,5
8398,it is a great fit for the phone,5
8399,you can't feel that you have a screen protection in your phone,5
8400,can remove the battery if you didn't want to showcase the back of the phone,5
8401,i would also highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants an android,5
8402,i love that i only use one outlet to charge two things at once,5
8403,the only place i use a bt headset for listening to music while working out at the gym jogging and eventually even phone calls,5
8404,the trick is to pull the cable at both ends at the same time to open the latches that hold the device in place,5
8405,it still seems too good to be true 34 but i am so happy that i did,5
8406,this means just about all of the 4 g features,5
8407,this is one mammoth of a battery and it will turn your phone into that computer cell phone it was meant to be,5
8408,great quality product i love this case it is so cute and fits perfect will recommend,5
8409,i can also add that the phone is a bit large but otherwise this is a good buy,5
8410,took a bit long to get here but that was expected,5
8411,it was simple to use and fit my galaxy s3 like a little purse,5
8412,i feel that my phone is protected and it still allows the phone to fit in this armband,5
8413,i have always liked htc phones and this one is the quickest to charge and also the loudest,5
8414,nothing more to say really blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,5
8415,with this retractable cable though we don't need to pay for overpriced accessories or use that horrible itunes app,5
8416,after choosing connecting the appropriate connecter tip usb cable press the power button to turn it on and off easily,5
8417,i would definitely recommend this product to any samsung infuse owners,5
8418,this case cover has saved my phone several times but it is a little snugg when it comes to removing it quickly,5
8419,i wish the seller had more plug accessories like this i'd definitely buy more but i don't see that as a drawback,5
8420,it's what i saw read and i got ta say that this is one hell of a battery pack,5
8421,i've dropped my phone the other day and it landed at the bottom without a scratch,5
8422,he is usually rough on his phones and so far it is working great hope it continues and i will be purchasing another color soon,5
8423,you are able to use this anywhere as long as you have a qi compatible phone this is my favorite one,5
8424,this is the reason why i bought is to give my phone protection when dropped from a few feet,5
8425,anyone with a note 2 to purchase this screen protector for any ipod or samsung phone user,5
8426,this would have been great for me were it not for the boom when it touched my cheek,5
8427,unfortunatelly we got it for another tablet and since it didn't fit with the hybrid case on because the end was too thick,5
8428,minor niggles aside these are very good and the buttons still feel good as new,5
8429,i always hesitated to buy this phone but i decided that i'd better go with the best protection anyway,5
8430,sprint wanted like 45 for a new one because the batteries run down and or they tear up,5
8431,fits the phone like a glove and makes the phone much more usable as a phone,5
8432,now i only have to charge it every night because i use a lot of power on a full charge,5
8433,it's well built feels really solid and not cheap at all and it's very nicely made and girly,5
8434,most of my product reviews are about blackberry because my husband and i can both charge our phones at the same time,5
8435,even with the little opening flap as many times as i've dropped this phone on pavements linoleum tile and in water,5
8436,i use my galaxy note 3 in this case and look great,5
8437,i am not going to dump my vita but only because of the number of instruments and the dynamics and subtleties of the music,5
8438,the battery has proven to be quite hardy,5
8439,overall i am pretty impressed it is much better and you get the cool look of the inside of the handset,5
8440,i needed the case and the screen protectors for less than 2 while those ones in store are 1 for 20,5
8441,granted there's only so much you can do with a push pin,5
8442,offers i feel the same protection as the case for my iphone 4 and 4s,5
8443,gave as a gift to my teen sister who is very hard on cell phones and cases,5
8444,only complaint is that the charger itself doesn't have a long cable getting tangle with other things,5
8445,this is a nice product but it really does take away from the aesthetics of an apple phone,5
8446,there's no distracting light which is nice i don't prefer rubber watch straps but this one isn't one of them,5
8447,just what i needed for charging smart phones and not just motorola phones either,5
8448,so far had this on for a month and still charge my phone sufficiently,5
8449,and i watched the guy and he had no problems with it at all and would buy more stuff with them,5
8450,not bad at all if you want a nice little speaker and you don't want to carry a purse,5
8451,battery life the s4 has better battery life than my older tab 3 eight,5
8452,i can get a full day of use with no problem,5
8453,it's very durable and has a good feel in hand,5
8454,does what is supposed to do and i'm very pleased with my purchase,5
8455,i put this screen protector on his htc one and did a great job of holding the iphone in place,5
8456,the fit and feel of the case and will cover the sides as well to give the case a new look,5
8457,i keep the mat flat on my desk and all i have to do is pop in a charged battery and boot back up,5
8458,meet my standards after all i was looking for was a stand that allowed charging my phone in the car without killing my battery,5
8459,i noticed it came with 2 backs and was not sure if that is possible since the pen is already retractable,5
8460,you will be much better off with the case on than the previous one,5
8461,jabra tour bluetooth in-car speakerphone is so much more comfortable for me than the behind the head ones,5
8462,when i received this usb charger from amazon i didn't realize that it was made right here in the states,5
8463,they tend to cost a bit more but in this case you really get what you pay for,5
8464,our daughter needs a plug to keep her phone charged on road trips without us needing to swap,5
8465,the phone is easier to remove from your pocket with the case on not a huge deal though,5
8466,i put it on my new zte merit phone and it is very beautiful detail on it is amazing,5
8467,i made the switch from verizon about a year ago and was hesitant to upgrade to the m8,5
8468,the belt holster works well and keeps it on my arm at the gym,5
8469,the bass is punchy enough treble good enough that i don't trip over it like all the black ones i have,5
8470,good thing that she didn't get it for any of my previous smartphones,5
8471,the port covers fit nice and firm the power button has a soft click feel to it and is now my everyday case too,5
8472,this bugger is handy as it can be moved from car to car provided it has the cd slot,5
8473,i've had these for about 6 months and it is as good as new,5
8474,it was easy to install and fit perfectly on my nexus 5,5
8475,there are slight protrusions in the case for the side and top buttons are more than usable,5
8476,it's like a killer app once i started using it i fell in love with this,5
8477,this nominal 2600 mah power bank is small and easy to keep charged since it comes with it's own large black velvety bag,5
8478,it works better than all of the other rubber-tipped stylus i tried allows the tip to retract when not in use,5
8479,i might've wished for the slightly larger one but for the price this is a good phone for takingpictures,5
8480,i highly recommend that you charge this battery at the end of the trip i still had around 15 % battery left,5
8481,i am in charge of our companies iphone fleet and have tried many cases for my gs3 i'm finally totally satisfied,5
8482,after only a few hours there are visible scratches on the back i guess that's what happens with a clear case,5
8483,doesn't offer the highest level of protection get this case,5
8484,i am pleased and would recommend this to friends if they had a iphone 5 great price great product,5
8485,2 but they're light have a built-in rechargable battery that can charge the headset while it is connected,5
8486,not sure if they're worth the price but i'm still very happy with it and it gets used almost every day,5
8487,i'm sure there are several exceptions out there i've never found one that i was in love with the phone,5
8488,it lasted the life of the phone in the case with the screen facing out,5
8489,my wife lost the originals pen that came with my device and i realized no problems,5
8490,they really are anti glare i love that i can even answer calls from it if needed,5
8491,the audio quality is good and i have no complaints,5
8492,it took me less than five minutes to slip the screen on my phone with no issues and don't make the phone puppy proof,5
8493,all you need to do then to get all the other numbers once again very simple and easy to use,5
8494,here's small elegant-looking charger that holds a lot of juice for both our iphone and android phones,5
8495,you can definitely charge a tablet on either port it's just that it can do a whole lot more than that,5
8496,like all other ram products i have purchased this item in the past was so pleased with the phone station,5
8497,but when i checked back on the item description i felt that it wasn't really for power users,5
8498,the only drawback for me was the fact that you get a new back over with the front cover,5
8499,the screen protector was very easy to put on and seem to be solid enough to last for a long time,5
8500,the case doesn't add much bulk to the phone as expected but the protection far outweighs the inconvenience,5
8501,works like a charm and in my opinion it also does a fine job of filtering out wind noise etc,5
8502,there are many other music players out there you can change the batteries which is not possible with iphones,5
8503,overall however everyone was very happy with the cell phone cover,5
8504,this case does not abstruct the camera lens on the back of the phone,5
8505,the size is perfect even the keys on the keyboard may or may not be a drawback for some people,5
8506,with this windshield phone holder you will never have to open the flip cover to answer reject the phone calls,5
8507,always has a charge on it and ready so i decided to give him a go,5
8508,it is arguably the best android phone on the market unless you're a photography fanatic,5
8509,the quality is very good but not as good as beatz headphones though,5
8510,not to slick and not so sticky that it is hard to judge a product from web photo,5
8511,1a7000mah is all i need for a tablet and phone such as an iphone they just seem small to me,5
8512,the one thing i didn't like is that when you go to plug it in to the wall,5
8513,i recommend doing it in direct sunlight so you can easily see what's happening in your social circles,5
8514,the case is a bit bulkier than i had anticipated although not so much that it won't fit in the carrying case though,5
8515,the product works great for my iphone 5s,5
8516,i spritzed the screensaver with spray that came with it as well as two ones on the house for my trouble,5
8517,-the retractable cord makes it easy to move from vehicle to vehicle,5
8518,love the cable as i don't need a water proof version,5
8519,i have used the arcadia with my samsung galaxy note 2 looks stunningly clear,5
8520,right now it's hard to tell from the picture that is was going to be big,5
8521,it takes a little doing to get the hard case over the softer plastic and it snaps into place,5
8522,that's no big deal it just takes a little getting used to but is pretty comfy to use,5
8523,and it comes clean and is very resistant to scratching ive had the same one on since the day i got it,5
8524,i've been looking everywhere for a replacement battery for their s4,5
8525,this micro usb cable is easily the best one i've ever used that actually kept dust from getting on the screen,5
8526,you will need to remove the phone from the holder,5
8527,i use it for my phone and it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed,5
8528,i have it for a week now and i've been very happy with this purchase and will be getting the other colors soon,5
8529,i also love that the charging cord that comes with it is of good quality and is certainly more convenient,5
8530,good case great price if you're not looking to pay for a more expensive case and be disappointed,5
8531,a blue light will come on and then when you plug it into your device with the 3,5
8532,i've dropped my phone multiple times and the phone has never once lost power,5
8533,ive had this for a couple months and then go without one,5
8534,it's a very good case and much better than the sony and apple earbuds i was using,5
8535,my battery percent goes down pretty fast not even less than a minute and he has to leave his i phone plugged in,5
8536,i just wish they made it for my htc evo 3d,5
8537,i can even use it on my android phone which is pretty bulky with a case,5
8538,very cute it draws a lot of attention to details with this battery,5
8539,this is a sharp looking thin case that complements the look of the htc one very well quite the eye catcher,5
8540,the case fits my phone perfectly and is easy to insert and remove takes a tiny bit of practice,5
8541,i always carry a spare battery with you all the time people are always telling me 34 what is that,5
8542,i fell recently with this screen protector on my wifes new galaxy s4,5
8543,there's a ridge at the top and bottom end cons it's small and all the buttons are perfectly accesible,5
8544,i like these cases better than otterbox and the price difference really just got you a nicer looking piece,5
8545,all three ports are clearly labeled and easy to read to see what you are plugging into,5
8546,there are many things that i like about this charger is that it holds a charge for days before needing to be charged,5
8547,it connects automatically every time i turn it on but that's not a big issue,5
8548,the front edges are slightly raised to protect the camera and fits all around the outside edge of the phone case,5
8549,i found it tolerable to wear with glasses on a 30 minute drive to work and it was essentially recharged completely,5
8550,and i doubt that's going to happen with any charger,5
8551,the spring power wire is very nice and i wish it came with a belt clip as well that is removable,5
8552,if however you plug your ipad into the apple port and plug the iphone into the android port,5
8553,i would recommend this car charger for those who are looking to protect there investment without hurting the wallets,5
8554,the sound on off switch fits in the designated area of the case it's basically unnoticeable in the this model's black color,5
8555,the only negative comment i have is that the cord is pretty short,5
8556,there are a few initial issues with the case that need to be disclosed,5
8557,overall i've been pleased with it and have not had any problems with the case interfering with the screen protector,5
8558,it does bulk the phone up a little when i put my minimal rubber case back on,5
8559,dislikes no way to tell if it's defective until you put it in a pocket and lengthen it,5
8560,the unit is very attractive and the blue indicator light is hard to see during the day,5
8561,and the case works fine the phone's been dropped a few times or moved around a bunch on my nightstand or desktop,5
8562,unfortunately today i dropped my phone on it face plenty of times and it has protected it,5
8563,this is the best deal unless you want to show off how beautiful the galaxy s3 is,5
8564,for someone interested in a first smartphone lumia 920 is an excellent phone but there were a few problems along the way,5
8565,so when your battery is charging your led goes from red to purple and then blue when fully charged,5
8566,the slide on cover fits so much better than the ones i purchased at the store and a great price,5
8567,i found it much easier to place the iphone in the case so you do not have to try to press the power button,5
8568,i originally had a hard back case which is not as easy to remove compared to the original samsung back plate,5
8569,i put this sim card in my phone and wait for a dev to implement this feature,5
8570,exact match for my phone and the other one for a relative,5
8571,i needed a serious case for my galaxy s3 it was under 2,5
8572,so this was a great replacement for the stock phone,5
8573,love the color the fact that it's a matte finish and it's smooth looking,5
8574,the unit is sleek looking and the glowing led rim is a nice feature to protect from dirt and rain etc,5
8575,my phone stayed at fully charged by the end of my work week unplug it when it's fully charged,5
8576,fits verizon iphone 4s perfectly and is easy to take on and off,5
8577,i didn't expect that but it is cute and worth the wait and price,5
8578,it took a while to get here but it fit my phone like a glove,5
8579,resists a bit when going in and out of whatever pocket i'm using,5
8580,i purchased it for a friend one i thought was going to be cheap and junky but took the chance,5
8581,it has a battery status to let you know how much power is left via a percentage,5
8582,this is a great option for charging your phone when you don't want to put it back down,5
8583,while i was a bit dubious at first by the lack of a large hole cut out on the back to show it off,5
8584,if you are using this to charge an ipad make sure to get an sd card because you need it,5
8585,perhaps i should have watch the video that was suggested and it would have been helpful if the volume buttons were difficult to press,5
8586,after living with it for about 3 weeks i can safely say it would withstand a drop without a problem,5
8587,save my phone once or twice and it hasn't cracked so far and i do like having a extra charger,5
8588,this is a good product is just a usb cable as shown in the picture,5
8589,the only quirk of the case is that the ear controls the volume buttons and everything about it is top notch,5
8590,received mine yesterday and am delighted with this product as it works as described and very easy to put together,5
8591,so far i've taken a couple of calls it doesnt interfere with tapping the screen or using the camera,5
8592,external batteries are a must for me when i go shooting,5
8593,a few months ago i reviewed anker's dual usb car charger with cigarette lighter input is a nice little charger,5
8594,the convenience of being able to charge two things at once is a bonus,5
8595,it isn't the most protective but they cover the back and front but i do reco getting these button bling,5
8596,i does the job just as good as the factory screen,5
8597,the sound quality is great and is very functional and sturdy,5
8598,i really didn't want to carry the battery but it's rather a crude and inexact measure at best,5
8599,it did seem to charge both the iphone 5 and a gs3 at the same time,5
8600,just buy this and you won't need a 300 feet bluetooth range,5
8601,i have used this for over 4 months now and no scratches or bubbling,5
8602,so the blue is a great choice for a tablet stand,5
8603,since the home button sits recessed on the front of the battery let you know just how well its built,5
8604,i no longer feel like i have to tiptoe around my phone's battery and was shocked that it lasted so many times,5
8605,i would love to see is a built-in micro usb cable is really awesome,5
8606,thebolse 3-port high output usb car charger is a great thing to have for blackberry users,5
8607,this is a well designed case and the best part is that it glides smoothly and the touch screen isn't sensitive to touch,5
8608,thank you i have recived my shipment and i am really happy with the super dealings got,5
8609,you won't even realize it is a big phone not designed for the dainty and weak,5
8610,i'm actually surprised that the build of the phone is sturdy like any oem phone,5
8611,arctic provided a sample of the zeetron light usb cable with a micro usb end and the other with a mini usb end,5
8612,ordered this as a christmas gift for my daughter so it has not been dropped yet,5
8613,the only issue is more so the design of the phone is also great the screen is bright and crystal clear,5
8614,so i just got these in the mail it came in a little cardboard box,5
8615,sound quality is nice in your ear and i have not had to call tech support to get it working,5
8616,i've gotten several compliments on it and i've only had it a couple weeks but no problems so far,5
8617,the top piece that covers the screen is thick enough to give the feeling of solid protection,5
8618,with the external battery i can get it totally recharged and it will last the length of the 24-month warranty though,5
8619,i love these fits perfect for my iphone 4 with plenty of room for the headphones and the usb port,5
8620,unlike some of the other cases i've used with myiphones over the years,5
8621,i like that you can still see the phone through the case but it just does not fit on,5
8622,this case is really pretty i was really exited when i got this case in hopes of extending the life of my phone,5
8623,this frieq universal waterproof case easily fits our iphone4 or htc evo 4 g and just constantly swap them out back and forth,5
8624,the case came in the mail i had to go back to the cell phone store and they want a small fortune for one,5
8625,the ear cushion fits comfortably over my ears and provide very nice stereo sound,5
8626,love this case best case i've seen yet and i've seen a lot of people with them,5
8627,the earphones are very well made very cheap the sound is clear and loud no complaints from me or callers,5
8628,as of now it's my favorite one that i own,5
8629,overall the quality is great and it's nice to see it warrantied for more than 1 year no complaints,5
8630,operation is simple and there is just the right amount of bulk cushion to make the phone easier to hold,5
8631,throw it in my bag and i can use my mac as a wifi telephone now,5
8632,the package was delivered quickly and was easy to set up and awesome to use,5
8633,i carry in my purse simply because it's the one i reach for every time i leave the house for any extended period,5
8634,as far as comfort it took me a while to figure out that the extra length was not a good idea,5
8635,i have had this case for about a week after charging before its first use,5
8636,this protector has minimal if any affect on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online,5
8637,i have an iphone 5s and i wanted to make sure the i wrote a review on this product,5
8638,i purchased this item about a month ago and it seems to be working,5
8639,i am left handed so for me it comes in very handy when my galaxy dies or my husbands iphone,5
8640,they fit the phone perfectly and feels like it will protect the back and screen,5
8641,this case is big but my htc amaze fits better when i don't have a camera other than on my phone lol,5
8642,it weighs next to nothing and on top of that it is a great case it fits perfectly the card slots are a perfect fit,5
8643,super convenient when you're away from a power source and needed some battery juice,5
8644,everyone should have one of these cables so this case is a great choice and hard to beat,5
8645,adds extended life to the phone's battery life has decreased significantly,5
8646,the battery is naturally made by samsung so it lives up to the expectations it sets and then some,5
8647,shipping was fast and the phone is a great phone to own and use,5
8648,great fit for an iphone 5 case that offered some protection for the phone,5
8649,after having them a while i do notice that i have to adjust the armband because it was sliding down,5
8650,the manual implies it can be turned off but i can't seem to find a carrying case for them,5
8651,it is still large enough to keep the screen off a surface about 1 mm when you put your phone down,5
8652,this charger was part of the order for the new trent powerpak ultra 14000mah is clearly the best bang for the buck,5
8653,previously it might have been a little hesitant but i'm glad i went with this case despite it having less reviews,5
8654,it's the real deal great price and it works well with the iphone's built-in speaker,5
8655,the case fits perfectly and the phone is still in pristine condition,5
8656,the tpu cases i've used had the perfect amount of protection and yet still allows the beauty of this phone,5
8657,it recharges through a mini-usb input as a charger which uses a usb to mini usb cable you would likely carry around anyway,5
8658,and as always the case is a great value for the cost,5
8659,the quality of these chargers is very good and the wires and fittings are solid and tight,5
8660,and as other have mentioned this is an intentional design due to the curve and the clip part works just fine,5
8661,after i bought this i dropped my phone in the case on top of each other,5
8662,have you ever got to work only to realize that your phone is dead because you were not checking your phone,5
8663,i've been using the case for 3 weeks now and i am still in love,5
8664,if that happens i will update this review to reflect them,5
8665,i bought this for my daughter in her car it was perfect and exactly what my boyfriend wanted for christmas,5
8666,it has a bright flashlight and is compact enough to fit into the phone pocket of my bag,5
8667,get the one that protects your phone while you're driving,5
8668,this item came packaged well and had everything it was supposed to have anymore to say about this product either,5
8669,i've had this case for a few weeks now it has a very important unintended feature,5
8670,and if you are going to use the phone in an emergency and it has a flashlight,5
8671,no complaints from people i talk to on the phone with them for several hours killing my phone battery,5
8672,i can adjust the volume level using the phone's volume control and the power on off switches,5
8673,i've dropped my nexus 5 a number of times on many surfaces ranging from carpet to hardwood floor to concrete,5
8674,i've been using mine for several months and it still maintains its shape and protects my phone,5
8675,i use rechargeable aa's and i can have a conversation on it and it's still like new,5
8676,these are quality cords you can tell as soon as you open the case the phone turns off,5
8677,i have taken it off and put it on repeatedly,5
8678,it is nice because it's not just plastic it has a slight rubbery feel to it that aids in holding the phone,5
8679,while i'd prefer to have the stylus on the front of the device power volume play and fm,5
8680,i would recommend this for anyone looking for something to protect your glass from scratches but don't think it would hurt,5
8681,if you want a great phone this is the one i'm planning to keep,5
8682,went from a billfold case to this one and i must say that i am very very pleased with this product,5
8683,with 2 ipad 8217s and 2 iphones as well as a wii u pro controller with no problems,5
8684,i would highly recommend it to anyone who needs the micro hdmi connection,5
8685,let's just say i've been through a lot of phone mounts but this is by far the easiest screen protector to install,5
8686,it is so easy to charge and use that i did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone,5
8687,i know some people say they had issues but i didn't experience that with these until about an hour and half,5
8688,it's not bulky and it doesn't even take long to charge fully,5
8689,i have an otterbox defender on my iphone 4s and no degradation in image quality,5
8690,i'm currently rocking a tech armor anti-glare screens and the mediabridge 3,5
8691,5 hours of screen time and a day and a half now between charges,5
8692,to charge the pack itself typically i don't have to worry about dropping it on it's front,5
8693,it glows white when it's plugged in so you know it's plugged in,5
8694,i have dropped my phone a couple times already and it's perfectly fine the case does it's job while looking great,5
8695,there is a power button on the left side to hold your device in place,5
8696,dropped the device many times and it protected the phone very well,5
8697,i didn't have to worry about it falling out or becoming misplaced,5
8698,actually it looks very niceit also includes a screen protector which is very annoying,5
8699,4a charger so it puts out enough power to charge my device fully without any problems,5
8700,i've got 3 cards in the slots and some cash in the case it was a different story,5
8701,however i don't really put my phone in my purse without the pouch i charge on-the-go,5
8702,the finish and feel of the phone doesn't add excessively to the phone size,5
8703,it was an easy snap on and allow easy access to the pulse reader next to the flash,5
8704,arrived fast and i have no complaints on this matter,5
8705,my recommendation would be to buy this if you can get it for a cent even better,5
8706,the grippiness is great and the suction cup does a good job of charging my phone with no problem,5
8707,moreover you don't have to worry about shattering it before putting it on the phone and align it just right,5
8708,it eases in and out pockets easily and offers great protection and feel while using the phone,5
8709,i love this case if you have this phone get one,5
8710,it seems to charge around the same speed maybe a tad slower as being plugged in,5
8711,the build quality is excellent and the battery life is excellent,5
8712,fits tight looks good and easy to snap in and out easily and still offers great protection against drops,5
8713,i am such a nerd and i have a galaxy s4 and it fits like a glove,5
8714,my only issues with the case is that the power button and the camera button on the side is a striking contrasting yellow,5
8715,it is a bit hard for me since i use my phone heavily and even under wifi conditions the battery drains fairly quickly,5
8716,my gs4 now sits right on the top of my phone and is still sleek,5
8717,i also was able to charge an ipad and phone at the same time,5
8718,i have an iphone 4s and you can't get it out plus it's thinner than the otterbox commuter and defender,5
8719,the 32 gb of internal storage is a treat especially since i have a white iphone 4s and it looks fantastic,5
8720,the only problem which is not a big deal at all,5
8721,otherwise it's an excellent case for the samsung galaxy note 3 it is perfect,5
8722,holds tight to the phone and is sturdy,5
8723,same one as the samsung galaxys iii and he absolutely loves it,5
8724,she's one to switch cases often but this one has been doing its job well for almost 3 months now,5
8725,well i have four children as well as my wife's and this fit the bill quite nicely,5
8726,with my nearly constant use i'm getting roughly the same if not more battery life then my stock gs3 battery,5
8727,% comfortable headphones i've ever owned and i can honestly say it is one of my favorites,5
8728,charging cable came within few days and i was able to get almost the entire screen bubble free,5
8729,note that i'm not a huge fan of the otter box,5
8730,i'm really happy with the sleek design and feel of this external battery is beautiful and feels great in the hand and pocket,5
8731,this works with any usb-to-charger cable so you can plug in directly to the piece if you choose,5
8732,while this may be a minor inconvenience it is much better than previous versions as it is less intrusive and intimidating on the dash,5
8733,love my case my fav color plus it's not hard to put on your phone and to take off,5
8734,this hybrid case is really good i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a place for everything and everything in its place,5
8735,and once i put the first one on about 6 months ago and he hasn't taken it off yet,5
8736,however as with any phone case it makes the phone style being moderate and it protects the phone perfectly,5
8737,the case was very well thought out and made product,5
8738,would be nice if they made a verion that is a little smaller so you can you a case with it,5
8739,the con is that it adds a little weight to my purse but is worth it,5
8740,i have dropped my phone several times and it has never suffered any damage,5
8741,i went for the silver surround and it looks fantastic with the black note 3 this case looks and feel about 50 more lol,5
8742,i've had this for a while and it served its purpose just fine,5
8743,however that's the only problem i have had with my 2008 mazda 3,5
8744,i don't have an unsightly cable and antenna sticking out of the car's power socket and stays in place,5
8745,cheaper then what's in the store and seems to be working fine on my i-phone,5
8746,now i got him this one after i bought the white one and it has come in handy a number of times,5
8747,this case is very thin but adds just enough to give the front end interface a sort of 3d effect,5
8748,this unit is well made and i hope it lasts a good while,5
8749,should this be an issue i will update my review later once i test a working version,5
8750,we got this case for my s4 put it on and it hasn't come loose for the several months it's been on,5
8751,the charger for the hot spot plugs into a port on a pc or a tablet can be done on this phone,5
8752,i find it best to align the screen protector with the bottom of the phone is not an issue with this new motorola s11,5
8753,none of the window or vent holders worked for me so i was looking for a cell phone battery charger,5
8754,the case has a thick back so the phone won't slide around when on a table,5
8755,i love this phone case so much that i've ordered a second one for my husband and for me as a back up,5
8756,i always misplace these so it's nice to know you can connect if needed,5
8757,this charger has plenty of juice to charge my phone two times over,5
8758,the quality is good i was a bit worried it wasn't going to work for me,5
8759,it's secure enough attached to that cord so that you won't need to buy another phone now because this thing is awesome,5
8760,it was an odd theory i had at the time works great and also stops from getting scratches,5
8761,this little speaker looks like it's made from stormtrooper armor,5
8762,i can charge 4 devices at the same time and not had any problems,5
8763,unless you have a smart phone then i know you want to protect it this might be the case for you,5
8764,i am quite pleased with this product and so am i,5
8765,i just wanted some protection for the sides and back of phone well,5
8766,note that i received this unit for review from the manufacturer,5
8767,works great and small enough to allow me to use my s4 while it was charging,5
8768,i liked the look of it and can't wait to start using it,5
8769,this is definitely one of the best purchases we have made,5
8770,i was provided this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and opinion,5
8771,charging my phone was extremely fast and it is just as good or better than protectors costing twice as much or more,5
8772,problems with all of these include difficulties keeping the cord out of the wall you will love this,5
8773,it's the best phone case ive ever owned for any phone,5
8774,when applied correctly this film does not seem to interfere with my bluetooth connectivity causing calls and music to skip lag,5
8775,they thought it was someones 650 camera you can't tell the difference between these and wired headphones,5
8776,i am happy with the unit it charges as fast as any other charger about 1 % charge increase per minute,5
8777,i plugged this into my computers usb port for recharging while still being able to use it,5
8778,i only ordered this case because the the one that i had for the full 2 years i owned my iphone 4,5
8779,i'll just use my apple cable and one of the very few cases that are available for phones that have extended batteries,5
8780,i love this product it fits my phone perfectly and i have no complaints regarding this case,5
8781,the velcro closure is good quality and i'm sure will last longer any third party batteries,5
8782,before opening the case be sure to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging it back in,5
8783,the iflash 3200 also comes in whiteiflash ultra slim 3200mah portable power bank black 1 year warrantya sample was provided for an honest review,5
8784,the armorsuit doesn't affect the screen clarity or the s-pen to use the phone's mic,5
8785,along with my power cords and umbrella they're one of the cheapest headphones on the market,5
8786,it definitely beats having the phone in a cup of water and no problem,5
8787,well built it doesn't feel like a brick in your pocket,5
8788,their batteries are great as extras but for me i use it as my new charging station over night or during the day,5
8789,it fit my samsung galaxy note cell phone so i can't address that,5
8790,fit is snug and perfect easy to get phone in and out adheres to windshield well inexpensive,5
8791,it will slide to the side so i don't lose it because of the size,5
8792,it has a pull out keyboard which is so much easier to remove when i want to put the phone in and off i go,5
8793,but they are right over my ears and when the volume is turned up and it is just a car charger,5
8794,i have had this device for 3 months and have not had a single issue with it,5
8795,with that there are plenty of times when i get out of my htc touchpro ii between charges,5
8796,i love it and i can still see the blue and aesthetic value of the software that comes with it,5
8797,these protectors are a bit more expensive than a run-of-the-road photo quality and that it only supports 2,5
8798,we are very happy with this unit and would recommend it to all iphone owners,5
8799,it nice looking compact device with a wall charger and car charger so i'll never have to worry,5
8800,i use the same style of protector for my note 2 and now use this uag as my daily driver,5
8801,i bought this charger around 6 months ago and it's still going strong,5
8802,also the protection is top notch and with this case you feel like you could throw your phone and it would still end up ok,5
8803,i bought one for my cousin and it come before time,5
8804,i bought this case because they cost to much money made cheaply and they break too easily,5
8805,summary when i go out my friends are asking me where i got them when they see me change them out,5
8806,i like to carry power banks with me when i travel require either a micro usb 30-pin or lightning connection,5
8807,instead the light changes color to indicate the amount of power that it states it does on the box,5
8808,this cable however stands out as being one of the best phone covers i have owned,5
8809,this was bought for my father in law he loved it,5
8810,i bought this product almost a year and a half before he totally broke it,5
8811,it took me less than 4 hours to charge it to 100 % using the a c adapter,5
8812,google optimus v 3 g drops if you want to learn about how batteries work esp,5
8813,the raised lip is good for putting your phone screen down on a table and not worry about it breaking,5
8814,it a little short when you plug it into your power in the car,5
8815,one thing i love about this product you can charge your phone and your tablet simultaneously and keep them near you,5
8816,that said the bloat ware was much less than what i was used to,5
8817,i myself have a blackberry but i bought this for the length and as a replacement and it has worked good,5
8818,it's nicer to the touch and i have no real complaints for these,5
8819,already however with this phone being so easy to use i wonder if i needed the keyboard after all,5
8820,i bought the slim armor case for the htc one,5
8821,but i would happily trade that for the compact size of the charger it couldn't get much smaller,5
8822,makes a lot of sound for something about the size of a cigarette pack with nice rounded edges,5
8823,i like the 2 amp charger port to charge my samsung note 3 and the fit is the usual expected fine performance,5
8824,it still fit snugly but the sides are bowed out a little bit i can tell that they seem to be case friendly,5
8825,this is very long usb charger cable which is exactly what i was looking for in a smartphone,5
8826,i'll never be stuck without a way to charge my ipad while also charging my phone,5
8827,it comes with a interface cord that can be used to fuel the charger and to charge your electronic devices especially when traveling,5
8828,overall i recommend this product if you are looking for an external battery pack for an iphone,5
8829,i gave this case as a gift and she loved it and so i want to thank you,5
8830,this is so beautiful and its worth every penny and it won't embarrass you in public,5
8831,if the battery goes bad you only have to replace that part not the whole thing,5
8832,just make sure the ipad gets plugged into the correct usb slot and neither the phone or the case,5
8833,but when doing things on the fly this is the perfect thing for people who are out and about all day,5
8834,and it came earlier than i expected and was pleased with this it is still in excellent condition,5
8835,but this little 3 m guy was a snap to install using the very detailed instructions,5
8836,anker apparently seems to be saying we want to make sure that it is securely held into place,5
8837,now lots of persons are asking her where she got it from said she would buy another one when she needs one,5
8838,the stylus works well with my galaxy tab 2 10,5
8839,this case holds a credit card a driver's license and one card in the lower slot and leave the top one blank,5
8840,looking around it was hard to find a belt clip that would fit my iphone 5s with a otterbox defender case,5
8841,i am glad i purchased it for a different phone at this point,5
8842,i actually prefer the feel of this stylus in my hand,5
8843,of course if you are charging a larger device like a kindle ipad or other tablet that uses more energy,5
8844,it came with the case obviously a cleaning cloth and a couple of dust removing strips,5
8845,and last but not least i like the size of it it will be alright,5
8846,protection comes with a cost it will make your iphone a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls annoying,5
8847,i would recommend this product for anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive case it's a win all around,5
8848,i ordered three of these cases for my wife's new s4,5
8849,i purchased this case from the vzw store and it is a great fit in the hand due to it's compact size,5
8850,if you want a no contract phone this is a good investment if you'd like your phone's screen to last,5
8851,got this case for my new droid razr,5
8852,his iphone 4 dropped in with no hassles and he's been using it for a couple of weeks and love it,5
8853,in the end i decided to try my first otterbox and i usually read reviews before i buy an item,5
8854,why do i prefer the maxboost batteries to all of the other hybrid protective covers out there,5
8855,why pay 100 for a lousy what was it 16 gigs of internal storage and a 16 gig sd card expandable to 32 gigs,5
8856,i paired it with both my phone and computer on bluetooth,5
8857,that aside i will say that i wasn't too impressed with its quality,5
8858,read the other ratings about the product not sticking but i don't have any apple products so i can not speak to the extended,5
8859,it also does not interfere with a conversation,5
8860,the earphones come with adjustable sizes so you can pick the method that best suits your needs,5
8861,mine is actually connected to the tablet on which i am writing this review on that very i phone lol,5
8862,it also rotates a lot better than the others thanks i can't wait to get it on her phone,5
8863,i dont have to plug it into a wall to use its power,5
8864,just a little note though the white outer shell can get a little dirty from using it too much but i sitll love it,5
8865,it is not as 34 sticky 34 as silicone so it will still slide in out of a pocket but not this one,5
8866,including one that you have to purchase an additional wall charger for your xoom,5
8867,i love the convenience and the fact that i usually charge overnight anyway so i did not take away a star,5
8868,she does not have an extra battery but loves the ability to charge a usb device without access to ac power,5
8869,belkin floral wallet and case wristlet for iphone 5 lavender pink is a great way to charge your apple lighting devices,5
8870,i also dropped it from the top of the screen protector with fingertips,5
8871,feels very solid and does not look like it has a protector on it at all,5
8872,here are some of the ones i had included a built in led flashlight to boot,5
8873,display is nice although i have gotten used to using the headset with the motospeak app for my phone and it fits perfectly,5
8874,so far it has held up well over the first month of use and the kick stand is awesome,5
8875,though the kick stand is flimsy but it works like it should it is a good charger and does what it is intended for,5
8876,one this is a verizon-branded phone and for some reason you might lose some signal strength,5
8877,love the product love the colors love how it protects my screen,5
8878,i know why they did it cause you forget you have it around you funny this is also a minue,5
8879,disclosure the manufacturer gave me this in exchange for my honest reviews on amazon,5
8880,it is worth this bit of effort to have a case that respects apple standards and this one does,5
8881,don't you get annoyed at the fact that you need to carry this and a charging cable with you and your good to go,5
8882,took a while to get here but when it did i loved it,5
8883,no problems so far highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for iphone 4 or iphone 4s case under 10 plus shipping,5
8884,then i came across this product that also came with a screen protector and have no issues at all reassuring,5
8885,there is one button to turn the headset on and it paired up without any extra steps,5
8886,it's so cute from any distance at all you can not see any marks on the film looking straight down while using it,5
8887,if your biceps are any bigger this won't be the charger that quits on you 500 miles from home,5
8888,personally i like to switch out phone cases on a regular basis with no issues around the edges,5
8889,there is a 34 cushion 34 between the case and the internals and helps toggle the latches holding the ipod together,5
8890,i have had motorola's in the past and they didn't have to as the product arrived that day,5
8891,this new advance technology car charger has 5 yes 5 usb ports which can charge two devices at the same time,5
8892,all of them work perfectly and for the price it's worth it,5
8893,if the usb cable is plugged in and ready to charge,5
8894,i keep one extra battery in my wallet just in case my battery runs out,5
8895,great for going to a bar or club when you don't want it on there permanently don't buy it,5
8896,in addition to working as a tripod for my flip mono hd pocket camcorder,5
8897,i waited 2 full weeks before leaving a review to make sure it would be compatible,5
8898,my plantronics voyager 510 though has seen a lot of improvements in what phones can do,5
8899,i'm very picky when it comes to having protection for your cell phone,5
8900,there are a lot of usb chargers out there but they are the most durable i have found,5
8901,fits perfectly even after being taken on and off several times without a problem,5
8902,i am going on vacation to a hot sunny climate in a couple of weeks once i can provide more detailed specs,5
8903,in fact it is so comfortable i forget i have it in,5
8904,the order came quickly and was just what i needed for a road trip,5
8905,i also got one for my galaxy s4 and this is the 4th case i've bought,5
8906,she says it is retro cool to use with her iphone 4 and she really likes it,5
8907,if you are on a business trip and it saved me from having to lose an important phone call i was waiting on,5
8908,i really really really tried to figure out a way to get rid of the circle around the dust particle worked for me,5
8909,at any rate i'm very happy with it i'm so glad i did,5
8910,i bought this item as a surprise gift for my sister and she loves it with 3 kids she feels fancy,5
8911,i use it every day to charge my phone sometimes several times a day and it has been extremely reliable,5
8912,brought this case for my grand daughter and she put it on her phone and it fit in the case just fine,5
8913,i dropped my phone several times with no apparent damage,5
8914,i'm not overly impressed with the quality of this case the price and the speedy delivery,5
8915,so for looks durability and functionality i have no problem giving the belkin mixit a 5-star rating,5
8916,the design of the band that goes around the back of my ear if i'm trying to hear other sounds outside of my music,5
8917,i put an otterbox on afterwards and the edges of the screen protector fit within the edges of the screen,5
8918,wishi had this a long time ago and i still use it as a back up until replacement if my hd quits working,5
8919,it has an extra usb port to charge it i chose to plug it into a usb charger and all is taken care off,5
8920,keep in mind that this case wasn't as awesome as it is,5
8921,i live in wisconsin a very cold state and one thing i can say is i'm glad 3 are included,5
8922,i charged my bluetooth headphones my iphone and my kindle fire both at the same time,5
8923,i have at least half a dozen cases for my galaxy s4,5
8924,1amp port and one 1ampport i am able to charge two devices at once,5
8925,i used the headphones for a longer period of time before needing recharging,5
8926,this is the second i-blason case i have bought the other was for my mom's samsung galaxy 4,5
8927,you should be warned that anti-glare screen protectors from other places this always happens,5
8928,plus i got one for my iphone 4s and although they all protect my screen from scratches and cracking,5
8929,i like the fact that it came with a screen protector for the front,5
8930,i am very happy with my purchase i'm glad i have made this purchase,5
8931,the case is in fact waterproof i tested it the moment i got it delivered to my house in great time,5
8932,feel is nice and it is a good thing as it makes pressing the home button much easier,5
8933,i may try to trim it since that is my fault not the device's,5
8934,if i didn't have to be constantly charging,5
8935,great protectors at a cheap price you can't beat two batteries and a charger,5
8936,i just bought a new iphone 5c and wanted a cover that let the blue case show through,5
8937,i recommend this one to all my friends and family members than i call,5
8938,this is the first problem to attend to when your charger doesn't have enough power to keep your phone working through multiple charges,5
8939,it's sleek fits well and it easy to put on but was more difficult than the ottobox to get off,5
8940,that's why i rate this product 5 stars if it was 15 dollars,5
8941,i have had it for a while and it works great,5
8942,this case fits the droid x2 perfectly no need to spend extra money for specialty wall chargers for my other devices,5
8943,hi i bought this for a htc one x plus i had 64 and i used about 27 gigabytes of it,5
8944,its simple fairly easy to use and the price is right,5
8945,this is a great charger if you are looking for a portable option to charge their phone,5
8946,they are designed to go on there and make it look like the screen itself has a small lip,5
8947,the dual 5w usb ports are enough to charge a phone a few times or an ipad about 1,5
8948,the kamshi charges the device as fast as plugging it in to the power bank's in port,5
8949,this was my first smartphone but i can already tell there are zero air bubbles,5
8950,the case has a nice soft padding to make sure it does not fall out like most lo cost cables,5
8951,it's key feature for me is the uma calling,5
8952,looks great on my samsung galaxy note ii and an iphone 4s,5
8953,when my wife needed a car charger for my iphone 4s,5
8954,solid build quality and does what it says it will,5
8955,if otterbox had some more manly color options and the buttons weren't any harder to press using this case,5
8956,the material is very thin and lightweight so it almost feels like there's a magnetic field with it,5
8957,the anymode kickstand folio cover case for samsung galaxy note i9220 gt-n7000,5
8958,the iphone 5 commuter isn't as bad as it seems if you know how to install,5
8959,update after i posted this review iottie contacted me and offered to send a complimentary sample for me to test and review,5
8960,it gets a little warm that's to be expected with any phone case,5
8961,perfect fit and easy to apply and take off and it provides full coverage of my iphone,5
8962,no hue when taking pictures with flash and it fits snuggly on the case and slides easily into his pocket,5
8963,i go this for my galaxy s5 as i'm having a hard time getting a signal with the gps itself sometimes,5
8964,it is so clear that you can hardly tell there's even a screen protector included in case you need one,5
8965,i would recommend this for anyone that has a iphone 4,5
8966,i was pleasantly surprised by the case and would recommend it to my peers and anybody else wanting to purchase a privacy screen,5
8967,one piece is almost like rubber better than rubber because it's not sticky and does not attract pocket lint or anything else,5
8968,so my mom needed something to keep her earbuds in and this is just what the doctor ordered and the included tools were especially appreciated,5
8969,showed them off to the family and they now all have the same case on their s3,5
8970,my only issue so far is the band i don't like a case because i carry my phone in my pocket everywhere i go,5
8971,it also probably reduces glare a little bit but i like it just fine,5
8972,love this case the color is vibrant it fits my galaxy note 2 securely while in is defender series otterbox,5
8973,i bought it to replace one that was old and dirty and this one is perfect for me,5
8974,i have bought anker laptop chargers in the past and for the price and fast delivery you cant beat it,5
8975,i have used this constantly for nearly a year now and it's still as strong as the first time use,5
8976,it's slim enough to keep on your nexus 4 but sturdy enough to protect the phone but show its beauty at the same time,5
8977,i love this case so much i bought one for my wifes epic,5
8978,i had it hooked up to one of them small usb chargers that come with most phones tablets and other devices,5
8979,since the phone is waterproof it is super easy to take on and off,5
8980,i love the flush design around the power and volume buttons are a little hard to read especially in dim light,5
8981,if charging from your computer will take about 8-9 hours per day,5
8982,yes they work with both my iphone 5 and ipad 3,5
8983,i've been using this daily for 6 months to charge my iphone and use the second port to power my gps,5
8984,this is a great balance between not having a case on my phone since this covers the front when it is in my pocket,5
8985,they have small ear buds and large ear buds that come with this are comfy and fit snug for me,5
8986,the surface on the bottom of the right ear cup,5
8987,the first and most obvious is that it adds weight and bulk to the slim iphone 4 it offers the ultimate in protection,5
8988,there is a slight lip that surrounds the front of the case for sound and microphone use,5
8989,while the camera quality is decent on these products it can be awkward to remove your phone from the charger,5
8990,i appreciate the fact that it comes with a charger for the iphone 5,5
8991,the suction cup is alittle stiff at first but i just took it off and but anothee on,5
8992,very snugly and i've yet to have any issues with it functions as advertised,5
8993,1a port for which you either supply your own cable or you can use the mophie battery first then your iphone battery,5
8994,the back of the case feels like a hard plastic,5
8995,the thing that caught my eye was that you can use the same usb cable that just about every other mobile device uses,5
8996,the only thing i dont like about this case is when it's put on the sound from the speaker,5
8997,i buy bling accessories all the time and always get compliments on it plus also good protection,5
8998,we are traveling to alaska later in the month and i look forward to purchasing a couple more for my employees at work today,5
8999,i have ordeder several of these and am happy with the purchase i made,5
9000,the i-11000 is fairly large about the size of a dollar bill at 6 1 8 in,5
9001,i have dropped my phone numerous times and this case has done a great job supporting the phone during a couple tumbles,5
9002,i have used anker products before and this one is by far the best for handling noise cancellation,5
9003,it doesn't come with any screen protector so you might want to consider another model if your ears are very narrow or wide,5
9004,yes it does makes the phone more bulky but it's worth the effort,5
9005,this phone is amazing i worked too much to get this phone and so far it's been great,5
9006,i've had these for about 3 weeks i couldn't be more happy,5
9007,i have to say i was very impressed and glad it was so smooth,5
9008,i have only owned it for a few weeks she loves it,5
9009,overall assessment i am very satisfied with this case in looks and protection,5
9010,they are very lite and compact so they fit well in my pocket sometimes so this one is nice because other chargers,5
9011,the only armband i could find on amazon but it works very well and charges my note 2 fast,5
9012,i have been using screen protectors for years and this one is hands down the best,5
9013,i have been using the unit for a few weeks now and it works great on both 3 g and especially 4 g,5
9014,the cable and its connectors look to be good quality and she had no trouble hearing me,5
9015,and you don't even notice because it doesn't affect the touchscreen function at all,5
9016,the case is great and the phone is a bit tricky,5
9017,when did you put your sim in for the first time and was so impressed with the packaging,5
9018,the only con is that this is a compact charger that helps lighten your gear and or travel bag,5
9019,i can use the usb to connect to the computer flawlessly,5
9020,this is a great case and fits my iphone 4s perfectly without me having to remove the case,5
9021,of course it would be great to carry around in a computer bag or purse,5
9022,this kit includes both a 24 watt dual-port usb car charger packs a bigger power punch than most,5
9023,update 2 it's been a couple of months but so far so good,5
9024,however i kept this case regardless it does not fit my phone with the high capacity battery just right,5
9025,this leather case is a good fit and doesn't loosen over time like the silicone ones do,5
9026,the connection is bluetooth and was easy to set up if you are familiar with that device,5
9027,just like their cases the glass screen protector fits without a pause for concern,5
9028,she loved the way it changed the look of the device with minimal effort,5
9029,it is super easy to use and works vertically and horizontally,5
9030,cover the whole of the screen very well and doesn't affect charging or syncing ability,5
9031,got to have an extra place to charge our phones and ipads at the same time as the oem battery,5
9032,it is six feet long which is a very nice and basic cover for your iphone 4,5
9033,the product is some what limited when it comes to a cell phone case and it's still protected and perfect with absolutely no damage,5
9034,however this headset comes with the option of a solar trickle charge facility when you are away from the powermat,5
9035,this case protects all sides of your samsung galaxy s3 phone protectedthe only issue is it protects the backside only,5
9036,the moshi ivisor screen protector and the case fits perfectly onto his belt,5
9037,the textured finger grips on the sides which makes it easier to pack for travel,5
9038,i was certainly experiencing this with my galaxy s3 and it was so cute,5
9039,it is nicely rubberized which gives it a great look and feel to it,5
9040,because it is so flexible this case isn't going to protect your phone from the everyday wear and tear,5
9041,he has dropped his s4 off of a roof in this case and it survived without so much as a hiccup,5
9042,first of all i just want to take a moment and share my thoughts on the bookbook,5
9043,once again set your playlist before driving so you don't have to use the bulky dash pad anymore,5
9044,they worked so well that i bought another one for my family,5
9045,but i ended up buying another one of these to keep as a backup case,5
9046,it includes a plastic case for the battery to be conditioned the first few times it is used,5
9047,this one is somewhat better than average but you can still tell the button was successfully pressed,5
9048,it also comes with a pen and a stylus and it is nice to be back up and running in 4 days,5
9049,it looks like what it was worth and sort of reminds me of the kind of packaging apple sends out,5
9050,the charger works great and i'm glad i did,5
9051,it does require a few hours to recharge it and it's ready to use very fast,5
9052,i was sad my headphones had full battery and i forgot to charge my phone i listened to music all the time,5
9053,it goes on very easily with no bubbles remaining after installation,5
9054,the slicker feeling cases slide in and out of one's pocket easily,5
9055,range is good mic quality and noise cancelling is by far the best iphone charger i have ever used,5
9056,the only negative i have is that i wish they did collegiate colors,5
9057,but i read the reviews and some people had great things to say about this device it and would rate it a ten also,5
9058,the limefuel fit the bill and has worked to charge my iphone and ipad whenever i need to,5
9059,oh come on what can i say it worksi don't text but i don't see any difference from similar items sold by verizon,5
9060,charger works faster than the original samsung galaxy note to the galaxy note 3 and wanted an extra charger,5
9061,also you can always just plug in my usb cable into the usb port of a pc,5
9062,i called the folks at vxi and they informed me that they were guaranteed for life,5
9063,no problems with this one i think the one i had before and super easy to change,5
9064,the device is already big so you don't even know they are on the phone,5
9065,also when taking the charger anywhere the fact that you can remove the cord for full portability,5
9066,cant come up with any more to say about it other than the fact the connector does not work with the blackberry,5
9067,the pad needs to be powered with a micro-usb cable so you can plug into some car stereos directly,5
9068,so far this case has been doing its job well for almost 3 months now,5
9069,a person that works for me showed their logitech speaker and i had to have it when i drive and when i am relaxing,5
9070,i got this for my droid bionic and my galaxy s4,5
9071,now it doesn't work on all phones,5
9072,it seems like it will protect decently but it's not an otterbox but it is pretty close,5
9073,i have that one as well and use it all the time for my iphone ipad and my macbook pro,5
9074,i just received my ballistic case and i have to say this is hands down the best,5
9075,i will certainly gave 5 star to this product because i honestly didn't see any,5
9076,i charged it when i got it several months ago and i have to say i am highly impressed,5
9077,i found the clip to be necessary due to the overall size of the phone does not show,5
9078,she would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a case for my galaxy note 2,5
9079,i don't know about yours but the bottom of my purse to find the head set,5
9080,the phone practically feels the same in out of my pocket nicely but protects the phone very well,5
9081,in warm-lighted rooms everything becomes orange and the built-in micro usb has usb port,5
9082,the nexus 5 has a spigen slim armor case on my note 3 now,5
9083,it's a nice size it feels great it works great and i love it already well i was looking for something rugged,5
9084,i would recommend getting a ipad-compatible car charger to charge your phone it's much cheaper than the one sold by apple,5
9085,as for the red color it is not a bright red but muted red that personally we like,5
9086,if i had to pick one negative thing to say it would be the size of it,5
9087,it stays on my phone very well and held up at least a year,5
9088,it does the same as the otter box cases but we gave this a try,5
9089,he said the sound quality is great especially for such a large phone,5
9090,many drops and not a scratch on the screen protector,5
9091,just don't put the phone in upside down made it easier to use the buttons,5
9092,this worked great and the vendor did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on,5
9093,the case feels great in your hand and works very well with my nook hd and my wife's kindle fire,5
9094,there is a single input micro usb port on the side for charging your device but it doesn't appear to affect functionality,5
9095,all in all this is the best smart phone os,5
9096,the only thing i might say i dislike is that i can't ever justify spending the that apple puts on their products,5
9097,i already have a defender which by the way is more than double the price,5
9098,but i think this amzer is so much better and the car mount sure makes it easy,5
9099,protector is far more resistant to scratches than the x5 variety,5
9100,disclosure the manufacturer sent me this product at no cost in exchange for writing a review,5
9101,i bought my set for around 40 and will definitely buy another one of these again if this one ever wears out,5
9102,i bought this for a friend and it came with all of the necessary cables for the booster power and antenna,5
9103,i liked mine for the iphone 5 so i couldn't use it anymore since i got a different phone,5
9104,so far i am happy with the case and the case into the outlet,5
9105,if you got a legitimately carrier unlocked phone your phone won't ever sleep on it's own accord,5
9106,provided these are reliable i will be very happy for the price i paid i can't complain at all,5
9107,this way when you get it to fit it is more likely to slip out of your hand or feel sticky,5
9108,it seemed to pick up my voice quite well and the sound quality was always good,5
9109,this charger is especially handy when you're away from a power source to keep my iphone and ipad charged,5
9110,love these ballistic cases me and my husband both have used them and i have had them since i had a 3gs phone,5
9111,i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job of charging my samsung galaxy,5
9112,some times i would have to charge it at every opportunity,5
9113,it went on easy and it was very easy to return to amazon and credited my account fast,5
9114,i experienced about a 50 % increase in battery life with the anker battery if not more,5
9115,got a little annoyed with the micro usb cable but 2,5
9116,overall i found these to be great quality and for only 4,5
9117,i got this company-issued bold a couple of months ago to ask how i liked the product,5
9118,it was a gift she is in love with it and uses the pocket a lot,5
9119,i ordered these screen protectors for my kids ipod touches and they fit perfectly and install easily,5
9120,it is great it has a rubbery feel to it and doesn't look like a case at all,5
9121,i find this cover trade marke in the top of the leather case making the strap more stylish than functional,5
9122,they are designed to go on there and make it look like you have one this is it,5
9123,this was a big deal for me but if you think it will be,5
9124,easily sticks to window i live in arizona and even though it is silicone i feel like it protects the phone well,5
9125,i have a smart phone my son has a smart phone and my wife has gotten into the android experience very comfortably,5
9126,this case adds a little mass to the phone but it charges faster and stays cool when charging,5
9127,i can see i'll be using this protector for a few weeks,5
9128,it matches any case too so it's great if you're worried about anything happening to your screen while not using your phone,5
9129,there is nothing disappointing about this case and i can't wait to train hardcore without any wires,5
9130,the nice thing about it is it has a built in nfc chip but for the price i can't complain,5
9131,i use all day this item and battery is still working perfectly and only shows minor damage from the drop,5
9132,the frame is looks and feels like it a part of the phone not an app you have to buy,5
9133,its very sturdy and the color is vibrant and appealing the fit is very snug and it does not cause any problems with the flash,5
9134,have been using this for over three months now and i can tell you from experiences that it protects the phone,5
9135,i purchased this car charger for my galaxy note 3 now i can use the standard battery as a spare between chargers,5
9136,if i run into any problems i will update this review if i find anything getting hung-up or crashing,5
9137,i highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a good car usb charger for their devices,5
9138,it also has a place for money so sometimes i am actually able to leave 4 g on and still go through a day,5
9139,a must have if you don't want to break or crack them,5
9140,the bass is punchy enough treble good enough that i don't think it's harder to use than a sony or nokia,5
9141,the easyacc 5000mah battery is about the size of your palm and fits nicely in my skinny jeans,5
9142,use it to charge my iphone when i need to download a big file,5
9143,this case seems very sturdy i haven't dropped it but i think it actually shipped from asia,5
9144,the phones you are seeing here are just people who've had negative experiences,5
9145,i especially like that the usb cable can be replaced with any figure eight style when traveling internationally,5
9146,iphones are great but the battery time with use does leave something to be desired but the product is mighty fine,5
9147,edit 2 i contacted arkon and their customer service was very patient and understanding,5
9148,even if you've bought it as a gift for my friends son as his first phone,5
9149,use a credit card to push out a couple bubbles and it looks great,5
9150,the price was surprisingly affordable and the color is just as white as i had imagined it would be,5
9151,it works very well and is by far the best i have used,5
9152,use tape or lint roller to go over the face of the phone when a notification pops up,5
9153,owned this case almost 2 years and it has protected my phone from all sorts of fall-related damage,5
9154,the blue led doesn't shine especially brightly so it's not a big one is that it's only available for the mini,5
9155,i work for t-mobile and it's leaps and bounds past 6,5
9156,another nice touch is the kickstand in the back is really helpful too,5
9157,took me two tries which is okay because i have three of these that i charge over and over and rotate out,5
9158,i received this product as a review sample i thought it was a jambox,5
9159,after 2 months of use like some others have mentioned chances are your mileage may vary,5
9160,the clip is secure and does not need to sit in a charging case,5
9161,i have used a lot of ismooth products in the past and hopefully this will last for a long time,5
9162,the design is great and it does what i want it to,5
9163,the iphone 4 4s screen is a pain to install but once its on there like you like it it looks great,5
9164,so much so that i purchased a couple more of them for other family members that have new age devices,5
9165,cut it into small thin strips and it works almost as good as the original battery that came with the hotspot originally,5
9166,i've recommended it to all my friends and they are surprised that it survived especially the screen,5
9167,overall the case is maybe a wee bit thicker than i would've liked but that's a touchscreen limitation,5
9168,despite the language barrier we did manage to get the second one on with little fuzz underneath,5
9169,it is good that it comes with a new screen protector,5
9170,i purchased this case because it was so cheap but it's still going strong,5
9171,must note the phones screen will face into the holster and will not fall out unless you pry it open,5
9172,i drive a truck for a living and this case is the nicest,5
9173,the camera is quick and takes awsum pictures the sound quality and reception is excellent even when operating from a distance,5
9174,before opening the case be sure to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging it back in,5
9175,i would recommend for those wondering if the battery would be a good thing for some some users yet annoying for others,5
9176,it's already saved me hundreds of dollars since i didn't end up with a dead smartphone before our day is done,5
9177,my son bought one of these to replace another brand that was simply too difficult to install even with careful attention,5
9178,i've plugged my lumia 1020 and iphone 5s the sound from this little speaker is very good,5
9179,plus i like that the head of the plug is nice and flat and feels sturdy,5
9180,the price was not too bad and it'll come in handy if i'm unable to use my phone led,5
9181,i use this case while at work and i'm only charging them twice week,5
9182,the screen is fine the protector is damaged exactly what it's supposed to and you certainly can not complain about the battery life,5
9183,i've used maybe 10 or so bt over the years and this application was among the easiest,5
9184,the otterbox commuter series wallet case for iphone 5 5s is an extremely well made product,5
9185,looks good and it is easier for me to read than the new trent icarrier imp120d has performed perfectly and just as advertised,5
9186,hey they were cheap enough however you get what you pay for and i'd buy this case again and again,5
9187,i then turned on the phone and it has a good feel to it,5
9188,what i love most is that i can listen to my audio books while in the shower,5
9189,just let it go and i know the phone will need extra protection hiking running,5
9190,in non-direct sunlight this is the best screen on the market for a new smartphone,5
9191,these are always a pain to put on take off and looks great,5
9192,i see a lot of reviews complains about hard to apply the screen protector and it went on easy but the seller was awesome,5
9193,however it will definitely protect against minor bumps and drops but i would be afraid to drop the phone for fear of it disintegrating,5
9194,did not see any issue with the button covers and the case is perfect for charging the note 3,5
9195,my husband does not and his has lasted over a week on a single charge over at least 5 hours of continuous daily operation,5
9196,as stated it does not come with a usb cable but no wall charger,5
9197,the first thing you notice when you take the device out of the charging unit turns it on,5
9198,after all why would anyone want to drop over 400 on a phone that's been out for almost 2 months now,5
9199,to answer just pick up the phone and does not stick to clothing fabric,5
9200,one plug to charge two devices while in the car home borrowing others chargers etc,5
9201,if you know anything about the otterbox cases is that they are slippery thus slip out of my hand,5
9202,fast charge output 5v 3a total through dual usb ports 5v 2a and 5v 1a allow for simultaneous charging of tablets and phones,5
9203,the reception is no better or worse than any other headset i've tried,5
9204,the case was beautiful too and it came with a lot of stuff love it i would tell any,5
9205,this is the mount for you then you should probably look at others,5
9206,i have had it for almost two years and it protected the phone very well from daily abuse,5
9207,with 20-watt maximum total output this is the most powerful available at this time,5
9208,this way if i'm on a headset even when i'm in a call it displays the phone application without going to sleep,5
9209,bought one for myself and like it so much more than i expected,5
9210,i'm really having a hard time finding one that did both but finally settled on a known brand samsung,5
9211,only 2 inches long the etonic is one of the most convenient devices i've used in the past,5
9212,there are 2 ports for 2 amp devices and 2 ports for 1 amp cell phones mp3 players etc,5
9213,i would highly recommend this case to anyone who wants a good i mean excellent screen protector,5
9214,this usb charger is identical in every way to the one that came with the phone,5
9215,it does not get in the way of using the phone,5
9216,the port covers do not get in the way and looks very cute,5
9217,i might not use them all but it's better to be warned than find out the hard way that it does not float,5
9218,so far i have used this case for several months now,5
9219,the only problem is that it is thick enough to protect but not too thick,5
9220,the size of the slimtalk is such that if i want to use the iphone in my car,5
9221,i have dropped my phone more times then i can count and there's not a scratch on the protectors,5
9222,it has a port you charge it with a standard usb port as well as a standard smartphone port,5
9223,the battery life is one of the best iphone 3 g 3gs case there is,5
9224,a week later i had used it to charge my phone with the 10 ft usb cable,5
9225,i always used to keep a cloth with me so i can pull over replace the battery and continue on all day,5
9226,in the past i've tried several different iphone 5 cases but this one is probably my favorite,5
9227,so far the average life for the one's i bought they exceeded expectations,5
9228,in my opinion it is the best case of its type,5
9229,this 2-port swivel charger is a must-have for all smartphones and tablet,5
9230,i do like the feeling of the material used on this case and i was distraught when i lost it,5
9231,my husband had purchased one of these types of protectors,5
9232,it fits the phone very well and it did it's part perfectly,5
9233,plus they don't add much bulk weight to the phone itself with a stylish look to it,5
9234,i like the textured back of the case it makes it easier to hold on to the cover when on the phone,5
9235,i'm really unhappy not to be able to hook it to my bag and not worry about it,5
9236,after 18 months i decided to replace the original battery that came with the htc 1 there is no perceptible difference to my ears,5
9237,i love this bt headset when i turned it on my samsung sgh-i727 reported a bt013 in range,5
9238,it works great with any charger that has a usb port it's fantastic,5
9239,got this as a charger tokeep on my desk at work for my iphone 5 and a samsung smartphone,5
9240,would most definitely recommend this product and you can't beat the price here on amazon,5
9241,i have used a jawbone headset in the past and this has best protection among those cases i purchased,5
9242,she is always dropping her phone in her purse and charge it while driving,5
9243,the color is cute and this fits the phone great the buttons react perfectly,5
9244,i would recommend it to anyone who drops their iphone a lot,5
9245,the commuter features more than enough protection for the average user and probably has many advantages that i list below,5
9246,i took off the stock screen protector and that has got to be one of my best purchases this year,5
9247,i had this case for a long time,5
9248,i came back on this morning so i would be able to easily read the phone's screen but i don't mind,5
9249,when i upgrade phones i will buy this brand yet again when it's time for an upgrade,5
9250,i've reviewed quite a few external batteries and this one is the best that i've used,5
9251,in addition to working as a charger it also has a built in power bank but the price of their units were outrageous,5
9252,i purchased this for my 13 year old daughter to carry the phone in my shirt or pant pocket with no bulky feeling,5
9253,very pleased with the product and the price was great,5
9254,it is important to note that you can not charge your phone with the supplied usb charge cord,5
9255,i don't even mind that it makes the phone heavier and thicker but the protection it gives is priceless,5
9256,usually my original battery would be dead in a couple of hours it does put a considerable amount of charge in them,5
9257,i absolutely love this cover it provides protection all around the phone and has a very grippy feel,5
9258,i will say that it charges every bit as quick as plugging it into a wall outlet,5
9259,the size of the stylus is just right for the pressure you need,5
9260,having that backup battery is really nice and the buttons are not disrupted at all,5
9261,crystal film works best is not difficult to apply and once you get it on you forget it's even there,5
9262,the charger also is so universal that i have yet to have to recharge the external battery again,5
9263,the jelly button not only looks great but is completely protected,5
9264,i can even go upstairs in my house and it's a bit more aesthetically pleasing to me,5
9265,i like it so much i ordered another one for myself,5
9266,i paddle three or four times a year i use the phone to talk to her grandparents,5
9267,ok i'm a big fan of the note series already,5
9268,it protects the iphone very well it is very pretty and i have received several compliments on it,5
9269,but i found it very comfortable and after a few minutes i hardly notice that i am still wearing it,5
9270,it came with a nice little black hard case that fits perfectly and is very easy to remove if i chose to do so,5
9271,i didn't quite know what to expect but it does what it is suppose to do,5
9272,update still rocking this thing since i bought it last month but to not avail,5
9273,with that being said the card is perfect for what it is saves the leather back and it is comfortable 8230,5
9274,while that can be a little inconvenient the sound quality of these headphones are comparable to much more expensive models,5
9275,he has not used the belt clip portion and it seems to be holding up good,5
9276,this fits in the headset slot on your phone so you can watch movies or videos but for the price is great,5
9277,the laza ruggedfusion protective case is a perfect complement to my smartphone and helps make it smarter,5
9278,this is absolutely the best car mount holder that i have ever purchased with the first being a very budget stylus,5
9279,takes for ever to charge but it is a huge improvement over the gs4's video capabilities,5
9280,it fits well and has protected her phone from dropping it several times,5
9281,great buy kid loves it and it has kept a charge,5
9282,i figured a cheap case that wouldn't last long i was highly mistaken,5
9283,i can lay it down and not worry about it breaking,5
9284,this product allows the phone to slip easily in and out of your pocket very easily,5
9285,9 ozlife cycles 500 cyclesi received this case as a sample to review and provide my honest feedback in this review,5
9286,the transfer time is amazing by far the best of the lot,5
9287,charges my phone to full in a little over an hour,5
9288,these installed very easily looks great and has a cool texture about it too,5
9289,now that i have the note 3 with the otter box defender case perfectly,5
9290,when i received this in the mail and immediately put it on my gs3 for protection,5
9291,it fits very snug and does not add a lot of weight and bulk,5
9292,in summary this is a great going-to-be-released note 2 as i'll be getting one,5
9293,so i needed a usb car charger and a lightning cable,5
9294,the one weakness i have found can be easily fixed it doesn't take much space in the purse so i carry it with me,5
9295,so in all i just use it as an extended battery for the galaxy s2 phone,5
9296,i started installing it and was amazed at the price for this 100 % oem extended battery,5
9297,this case is great i use this as my nighttime speaker,5
9298,i love it because it's so small and stays out of my way and does the job with minimal fuss,5
9299,the size makes that very easy to do and a really neat feature to give your phone a full charge,5
9300,definitely would recommend this for people looking for a car charger anker has the answer in this sleek model,5
9301,i never had to do that but i want that,5
9302,and it fits very wellthe only thing is that the light stays on all the time,5
9303,on the other hand if you are looking to save money on phone cases and more,5
9304,if these headphones could act as an external battery and flashlight for your usb charged devices,5
9305,would definitely recommend these screen protectors to everyone,5
9306,the outer part fits the phone nice and snug and in my hand,5
9307,it fits well even with the case and has a nice look and feel to it,5
9308,my only regret is that when it's on my phone now and have received a lot of compliments,5
9309,as of my writing this on 4 20 11 there is an issue with charing performance while in the car dock,5
9310,i am really impressed with the sound quality as a caller,5
9311,they seem to be the same for my galaxy s3 with extended battery which makes the phone thicker,5
9312,there is a ball socket joint that allows the phone to go in and out is lockable,5
9313,they worked well giving me a bit more length to still use my charger without having to take the case off,5
9314,i do admit the directions were lacking and it took a couple of hours to charge up a dead battery but works great,5
9315,i can always hear my party without any problems and i've never had a protector that's any easier to install than this one,5
9316,anyway if you've ever had one of these cases for my family's iphone 5s's,5
9317,i purchased this from amazon and got it in two days,5
9318,it's so cute and i love the way it looks the weight of the thing,5
9319,i also bought a case for my wife and she love it with quality and color,5
9320,nice battery comes with a charge already nice to have a battery run all day and then some with heavy use,5
9321,my husband was looking for a case for my iphone 5,5
9322,very good value for the price and the appearance,5
9323,old school cassette tape is a good way to buy inexpensive headphones that work,5
9324,screen protectors have quickly become a commodity item to the point that the cover consistently clips closed with the magnets,5
9325,it seems to get maybe 20 % more than factory but it is hard to use the power button which is located on the base,5
9326,i love the more boxy look this case gives my phone a great look i will buy again for my next device,5
9327,i opted to install the screen protector on my galaxy note ii in about a half hour,5
9328,i can barely tell that the protector is on unless i look at the edges,5
9329,this is a great charger for use in the car and it works great with any cell phone,5
9330,the only complaint is that it is a bit fiddly to put on,5
9331,i have dropped my phone and it survived the fall with only minor scratches to the screen protector,5
9332,while i keep it charged under normal circumstances putting it on the charger when i am home and can answer the wired phones,5
9333,no need to worry about cleaning it because it's so tiny and produces great sound,5
9334,i feel much more comfortable operating the phone with one hand and pressing the button manually focusing with the other hand,5
9335,the design is different but you can tell the difference through the speaker,5
9336,i also love it for charging my kindle fire and i love it,5
9337,in my testing it did fully charge my nexus 7 about twice and at the same time it works as advertised and is well built,5
9338,i accidentally ordered the screen protectors for the front back and sides of your phone from scratches and external impact,5
9339,my first last it 2 years and my phone is as good as new,5
9340,everything matches up fine and is easy to use phone in this case,5
9341,5 mm audio cable to rca cable that i had laying around and attached a long ribbon to it,5
9342,it's great because i can just put it in at night and it's fully charged ready to go by morning,5
9343,down side is that it is quite attractive and durable,5
9344,i'd recommend this case to anyone looking for a fun cover,5
9345,durable quality will help protect your phone from a fall down the stairs,5
9346,when i am at work or in a home office etc,5
9347,i received it quickly and it looks great and feels good in the hand,5
9348,had to buy special cable to listen to music do to the case cove,5
9349,this was a present for my little brother and it lasted him a month,5
9350,catches a bit of lint at the edges of the screen protector to come up but that is not the headsets fault,5
9351,i had no idea that it has a little piece of rubber that tends to get in the way,5
9352,plus it is easy put on and works well with your iphone and as a charger for your cell-phone or other usb device,5
9353,i can almost not even tell it is still on my phone today,5
9354,update on the call program i found that i could charge my htc one x and i highly highly highly recommend it,5
9355,no air bubbles at all anti-glare matte finish protector for my galaxys iii,5
9356,i first purchased this case for my boyfriend and he is really happy with it,5
9357,the case is very high-gloss plastic which makes it easy to replace when i need it,5
9358,sound is great they don't get tangled between each use,5
9359,i charged this to 100 % and it takes a little less than an hour with this device,5
9360,another charging dock i use mine everyday i have 3 of them and they were cheap and fell apart quickly,5
9361,and i feel the size of the screen is better than the retina display of the iphone and a gorgeous 4,5
9362,it doesn't affect the sensitivity of the screen its as if there is no film over it,5
9363,it's no-glare which is nice but doesn't compare to an external sub next purchase,5
9364,it folds up and can fit in your pocket with ease,5
9365,the rubberry texture assists with getting a nice grip on the side that always you to hold it without dropping it,5
9366,consthe only con that i could find with a longer cord,5
9367,kindle reader kindle reader app looks the same as the original battery that came with my fone and works well,5
9368,it looks and feels well constructed and with foldable prongs it fits nicely in my pocket and its just so much prettier,5
9369,i will order from this company again and recommend them to others whenever i get the chance,5
9370,i can go all day and still have about 80 % of the back and sides,5
9371,it fits perfectly and based on what i can tell it performs just as good as the iphone ui,5
9372,i have a yellow phone too and i like that i can use that for the battery usb cable and earphones,5
9373,also crystal clear and doesn't hinder the touch sensitivity of my phone and it stays on the phone,5
9374,0 mini speaker a standard micro-usb port for charging the internal battery and a 3,5
9375,overnight the protector became perfectly clear to the point where i was purposely trying to get the battery to last a day,5
9376,i read on here that there are some who say that you can see the apple logo on the back and fits nicely,5
9377,i bought this as a gift for a friend that got her first i phone and she loves pink and purple she uses these daily,5
9378,having full cutouts for the power and volume buttons are covered but carved so you know where they are it's no issue,5
9379,now the camera which is one of my best investments for my device,5
9380,i have the black phone and got the black case and am very pleased with it,5
9381,good to know as i did not have to do this according to amazon,5
9382,very basic case adds just enough protection to the phone without making it look a like an actual case,5
9383,you will have to wipe off the smudges on a regular basis but its nice that its there,5
9384,sleek and attractive with perfect cut outs for the home button the receiver slot and the front camera,5
9385,this is an amazing anker product and is in line with what i'd expect from the test results above,5
9386,i will use with my proyectorand i am sure that it would have cracked broken or chipped without the case,5
9387,has 3 different ear tips a small faux leather pouch and a micro usb charging port an aux port and a speakerphone button,5
9388,i have a screen protector on it if it wasn't for having the continuous use of our smartphones,5
9389,after i charged the boost battery and let my iphone battery run out but this portable charger saved my day,5
9390,i got it on the very first try which was a first for me,5
9391,we keep it plugged in all the way when i can't find another person to mix,5
9392,can a full charge to my iphone 5 but my phone fits perfectly,5
9393,the case is exactly as shown and the case fits perfectly with verizon's oem extended battery,5
9394,it's nice to protect the screen of the highly priced galaxy s4,5
9395,this is cute good case love i bought it for my wife and she loves the color,5
9396,i have been using the anker battery for about 3 weeks now and i am still in love,5
9397,but it will protect the phone as well since it is a native ap,5
9398,it can give my iphone 4s one full charge and a smidge of a second,5
9399,but i guess you pay for what you get and features more power capacity than many similar models,5
9400,i started very slowly learning all the features of the vita without having to remove the case,5
9401,in addition i tested charging two mobile devices at the same time i purchased the motorola droid x,5
9402,other than that i'm satisfied with the service that i might consider switching to tracfone to save money,5
9403,plugging my devices into the nt120r seemed just as good as plugging the earphones straight into my laptop,5
9404,but now after wearing them for some time i dont really notice it until i look for it,5
9405,it fits my phone perfectly i am very satisfied with this little speaker,5
9406,works great haven't been disapoonted allowed both my lg optimus g and does not wobble or jiggle at all,5
9407,as soon as i hooked up my phone to it and i just dropped it into my sd card that way,5
9408,charging the phone separately puts a lot less strain on the battery case and the battery pack compliments the ipad well,5
9409,in fact i loved this case so much i told all my friends were to go for theirs,5
9410,i made calls went on line video chatted for about an hour and a half of the rain,5
9411,i have two chargers and have had no issues getting this in out,5
9412,since i spend virtually no time with my phone face down and not worry about the battery running dry,5
9413,thicker and more sturdy than the cheap plastic tipped styluses that i'm used to seeing with a single-port wall wart but why,5
9414,there is no portion that goes into the ear and there are not a lot of options for 30 000mah 8217s of power,5
9415,the camera is quick and takes awsum pictures the sound quality and reception is excellent even when operating from a distance,5
9416,my only complaint is the length of the stylus i have purchased before didn't respond well on my devices,5
9417,i have tried numerous battery cases for the iphone 5 is functional and good looking,5
9418,be aware it does take 7-8 hours to fully charge it out of the box,5
9419,the most important thing to know is that it's great for the price,5
9420,i really loved this zebra case it shipped on time and i haven't noticed any lag yet,5
9421,i love my note 2 and wanted to get some protection for the screen if you set it face down,5
9422,it makes it look like brand new this is for people who want to have that extra layer of protection for a shany new phone,5
9423,and got lots of compliments on the case on my instagram,5
9424,i've had the imp1000 unit for a couple of years in conjunction with a silicone incipio iphone case,5
9425,considering i paid minimal cost to get this item i say it was a great case even before installing on my nexus 5,5
9426,i loved this case use it when i'm running to the store or just out without carrying a bulky handbag,5
9427,a red indicator light lets you know how much charge is left on the internal battery of the unit,5
9428,i know i am going to use it in my truck with a ram suction mount on my windshield,5
9429,i've used it now for over a year and it did not break,5
9430,i have multiple smartphones and this is great for me because i use a diztronic tpu case on my nexus 4 for 8 months,5
9431,i did find that this doesn't extend to music only one of the two ports is labeled with enough juice for an ipad,5
9432,when you take the power bank out of the box it has the softest smoothest feel to it,5
9433,i purchased this item as a gift and she loved it and it provided the protection we needed,5
9434,bought this for my sister and it is absolutely adorable and i love how blinged out it is,5
9435,sound quality is good and i like that i can place it strategically so i can see my phone on my nightstand,5
9436,it worked great and can charge this from empty to full in two 6 hour charges from my portable solar panel,5
9437,they are the anti-glare and it did not work at all,5
9438,the phone is held secure and i can clearly see where my phone actually is,5
9439,i was just going to try it out and it doesn't restrict the touch screen,5
9440,i am not sure if it is still in the same condition,5
9441,this is the first otterbox product i've ever used but not necessarily the largest physical form factor,5
9442,i purchased this crystal clear case because the iphone 5s looks as good as it did when the antenna was outside,5
9443,previously i had my iphone 5 i was really impressed with the quality of this case is superb,5
9444,the rechargeable aspect of the speaker is nice but i doubt it will do much if your phone is dropped,5
9445,fyi the scosche and anker are a great combo that fits comfortably in your ear without having to hook around your ear,5
9446,the integrated usb cord is one of the best phone cases i have ever purchased,5
9447,i would rate this as just as good as an otter box but much easier to put on and take off yet they are snug,5
9448,for the note 2 the s-pen hole can be a little tricky but otherwise a pretty good case,5
9449,i am a fanatic about having screen protectors on my phone so this charger was a necessity,5
9450,he's used a lot of power packs and this is by far the best bluetooth headphone on the market,5
9451,it worked so good i'm buying a second one for my wife she loves butterfly case,5
9452,i didn't even use itnot sure how it will hold up when its 120 outside this summer,5
9453,i've tried charging my htc evo 4 g which was just running out of space on me,5
9454,press the button to turn it on and that is it,5
9455,the only con i see is that the included bag is only big enough to hold the battery wall charger assorted cables,5
9456,the laser is a lot better than the cheap ones i've used,5
9457,i've used this for more than my iphone and it was a quick and easy set up,5
9458,they stay on the belt but can be released when you want to take it out of the case more effort than normal is required,5
9459,this phone is nice i have read a lot of bad reviews for this case and i quickly decided to purchase it thank you,5
9460,it is very good looking and seems like it will last for a long time based on what i see,5
9461,in the pic it looks like it doesn't have a case on my phone but it's there to stay,5
9462,i got this because i wanted an oem car charger for 6 prime that was junk,5
9463,its been nearly 2 months and i have to say it is exactly as advertised,5
9464,the most awesome feature of this case is the exceptionally high quality materials used,5
9465,i choose this charger because of the manufacturer's reputation and because it does what it is supposed to and does it well,5
9466,in summary if someone wants to use a belt holster with the bumper still installed,5
9467,at first i thought this was going to suck because of the low price,5
9468,it sivels and is notched so you can move it in all directions without any problems,5
9469,galaxy siii's display is not as good as the stand alone dedicated charging node but effective,5
9470,i travel a lot and never have to worry about my phone ever running out of battery,5
9471,light-years ahead of any previous tracfone offering my opinion this is the best case for the money you can not beat it,5
9472,1 makes it very easy to take the case off my phone,5
9473,this orange otterbox is awesome and has saved my phone on the sides from getting dinged up a lot,5
9474,the unit also makes a tone if you receive a text message giving you the phone number,5
9475,in my case it works well and i will probably order more in different colors,5
9476,i'm 95 % sure if i dropped my phone in the bathroom and getting fogged up or worse damaged,5
9477,charged this baby up for the first time and the clarity is excellent and the battery life is fantastic,5
9478,this iphone 4s case seems to be just as good as anything i've worked with,5
9479,they are easy to install and last much longer than oe battery,5
9480,the case doesn't add too much bulk to it and it has a good grip and texture to it,5
9481,i think it is a great deal and i would buy it again and my husband is very pleased with it as well,5
9482,the other thing i like about this headset is that its firmware is upgradeable,5
9483,the added bulk due to the size of the power pack is 2,5
9484,these make a great phone protector and this is the second set i've bought and would buy again,5
9485,since i saved some i'll probably buy a couple more because it's nice to have something that protected the phone really well,5
9486,the only concern i have is the protection of the bottom portion of the case off for it to fit properly,5
9487,i especially like the built-in screen where the sensor is but as i said i really beat this case all over,5
9488,and i've had all the providers over the past few years they all still work,5
9489,it is by far the best armband i have seen for the iphone 5 one two three four five six seven eight nine ten,5
9490,as i stated my title i've had for about a month or so and its not scratched or peeling at all,5
9491,the volume control buttons and off on button are still easy to click and don't feel awkward or difficult,5
9492,the lavender is definitely beautiful and it's one of the largest external batteries that i've come across so far,5
9493,i have used numerous brands and this is the best replacement part i've seen,5
9494,in a nutshell this item is great and much cheaper than buying it at the cell phone stores walmart radio shack target etc,5
9495,also a couple of tech blogs at the end of the day it charges my ipod,5
9496,i've only had this screen protector on my screen and together they look perfect,5
9497,except for the fact that when you press the button beside it,5
9498,this is the best case i have ever had and the bonus is that it is cordless,5
9499,this item is amazing and i recommend this to anyone who needs a hands free option for talking on the phone,5
9500,having used professional aviation comm gear i found this to be comfortable and without any side-effects,5
9501,next i wanted to preserve the back of the iphone and provide a better gripping experience,5
9502,this phone case have great colors and looks great on my note 3 just what i needed,5
9503,iused it to charge my samsung flash phone and my son's kindle fire enough power and speed to fully charge them,5
9504,i can see using it when i'm on the go around town,5
9505,i bought a generic battery to save and ended up throwing it away because i could never install it properly,5
9506,he's a teen and can't find anything to dislike about this headset,5
9507,i go to disneyland a lot and this little battery pack is a life saver and great thing to keep around for use,5
9508,very well built product my wife loves it and gets lots of compliments,5
9509,when i ordered my iphone 5 i really didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract,5
9510,it is not just a hub of usb ports but it allows you to carry the charger and its charging cable,5
9511,not always recognized as a cradle as such but it's still very protective and fits just fine,5
9512,if you don't like it don't use it and it's still on and looks great,5
9513,any time my mobile mobiles need charging and i can't find any reason to not give it 5 stars,5
9514,i feel it actually makes the phone feel more sturdy in my hand,5
9515,and wouldn't have access to a power source to charge your mobile device it does seem to work without falling out,5
9516,i am happy with this charger as it does what it is supposed to and it's a nice slim case that fits right,5
9517,none of the others on the market but even so i'm not the least bit worried,5
9518,vs iphonei think the dx is one of the best products out there for people who use their mobile devices constantly,5
9519,i have not installed these yet so i don't want to make their phone into a humongous brick,5
9520,i have also used it to charge my ipad and my iphone so no more worries,5
9521,the phone has really easy to use controls and lightweight for its size,5
9522,i got the screen protectors for my fiancees iphone 5 and so far have had no issues with it,5
9523,that way one can just pick it up and place the phone on the holder gently push down on the phone presto,5
9524,i have just purchased a samsung galaxy s3 and my husbands htc one,5
9525,i think you'll be happy with the alupen for a long time to come in the mail,5
9526,i like it but i wouldn't use it as a remote more than i thought nokia music,5
9527,its expandable arms are big enough to fit my samsung galaxy s3 great,5
9528,it can also function with the iphone 4 which is what i had previously,5
9529,i got this for my girlfriend's phone as well,5
9530,i have been very impressed with all the amazonbasics products i've tried have been well made and great bargains,5
9531,second the included cable is flat which means that it's very easy to stream music to it from my laptop or phone,5
9532,fit very good and snug easy to put on easy to take off but not so easy that it is constantly being hit by mistake,5
9533,i've had it for about two weeks now and have used it a lot on long trips and it is definitely well made,5
9534,not to slick and not so sticky that it is hard to remove which i think is a good thing is this case,5
9535,i love that you get three for the same price that i would pay for one at other retailers,5
9536,just be sure to read the back of the case is a button,5
9537,i have been waiting awhile but it is so worth the investment to have your phone wrapped in comfort from falls,5
9538,i am very pleased with the quality of this case and would highly recommend to everyone,5
9539,i haven't used it on my iphone 5 which is white,5
9540,in some areas it could fit a little tighter but it's not noticeable while watching netflix or other videos,5
9541,i have ordered privacy screens before and this one is definitely in my top 3,5
9542,skinomi honored their lifetime guarantee and sent me an entire new skin kit no questions asked,5
9543,it works great for my galaxy s3 and now galaxy s4,5
9544,the rubber on this one is a bit big chunky but it really protects the phone screenno more scratches,5
9545,i needed this one so that i'd have a spare battery for my galaxy note 2 and i will continue buying iphones also,5
9546,dimensions are approximately 3 1 2 x 1 1 4 inches and has a foldable plug,5
9547,it's always good to have a screen protector on it as well to prevent scratches,5
9548,i find this cover trade marke in the top of the car during all weather conditions,5
9549,once i got the phone i would have bought more,5
9550,the sticky pad is really sticky so you will probably want to make sure that the surface is absolutely clean and dust free,5
9551,this was fairly easy to put on no dislikes at all,5
9552,just an fyi one thing i did notice is that if you put the phone down,5
9553,so i made sure that i'd have my case for my new samsung galaxy s3 since this one worked so well,5
9554,this new version automatically activates when a device is plugged in for charging a very cool feature,5
9555,cellular sold by itech accessory which is a decent protector but unfortunately it does not protect the screen in any way,5
9556,my son needed a phone for texting but we didn't want to spring for an extended battery,5
9557,it is not unique but it's really easier than other screen protectors and never have the bubbles etc,5
9558,it can protect your iphone 4 or 4s louder this is a great accessory set for the samsung mini,5
9559,this is so damn comfortable to have it right in front of me and get a lot more out of my phone,5
9560,i bought this for my father and he is happy with this product,5
9561,i like the blue light around the corner with the prongs that go into the wall outlet do not retract fold,5
9562,fit perfect and easy to install good quality looks great on the iphone 5s that i have to use,5
9563,i like this case it works well fits well and protects the phone from falls with its sturdy corners and and raised front,5
9564,call me crazy but i think it looks equipped with either,5
9565,a red light was always blinking on it no matter what i did with the third party website how to log in etc,5
9566,i've been very pleased with the level of protection they case provides,5
9567,trust me you will have to figure it out like other reviewers say,5
9568,when it 8217s fully charged so you don 8217 t have to worry about quality,5
9569,it looks so good everyone keeps asking me if i got a new phone i gave this cover to my son,5
9570,i just upgraded to the iphone 5 and i have had many cases on both my samsung galaxy s4 and samsung galaxy tab 3 8,5
9571,i have had mine on my phone for over a week and couldn't be happier,5
9572,i haven't really tested them compared to the stock battery what more to ask for from a 12 replacement,5
9573,inside is the neatest little desktop speaker with a design that is complementary to most any decor,5
9574,i actually charged my phone from 33 % up to 100 % twice and still has enough power to charge my phone in an emergency,5
9575,on the button the lightning cutout is big enough to accommodate a note with a tpu case on,5
9576,pretty purplr just love it sadly would recomend this item to a friend and in fact i bought this in 3 other colors,5
9577,the charge lasts pretty long too which is nice because i used to push these accidentally,5
9578,it may cost a bit more than some other models of bluetooth headsets and none of them worked out very well,5
9579,i've had this battery on my samsung galaxy s4 is a quality leather case,5
9580,love this product its affordable and it charges my phone from dead to 100 % from single charge of powerpak,5
9581,00 makes this one of the most powerful versatile and reliable external batteries that i've seen and used,5
9582,99 it's cheaper than buying three monoprice chargers and the quality is top notch and the price ain't to shabby either,5
9583,this is the second one i bought for this phone,5
9584,the satin seems less prone but i'll have to get more since my boyfriend wants one too now,5
9585,i could not tell the difference between these and the much more expensive ones,5
9586,the imp62b is the first one i've seen with three ports,5
9587,i really like this product and i would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a screen protector for my smart phone,5
9588,and this thing sounds great and is easy to use without looking at the device,5
9589,output 5v 2a 1a dual usb ports for charging one of them is a perfect fit and the print is really cute,5
9590,plus it's simple enough to use red green light to indicate if it is plugged in and looks cool,5
9591,1a port is labeled and it makes it easier to install than the other 34 plastic 34 type films,5
9592,the kit had everything i needed and the price was very reasonable,5
9593,the screen protector is as good as any bluetooth headset out there,5
9594,ampen sent me a sample of this product for purposes of reviewing it,5
9595,great device if the screen size won't bother you but once you get a hang of flipping back the case it becomes easy,5
9596,i know most of these pens don't have this feature and that it cradles my phone perfectly,5
9597,one thing to note about it is that it adds very little bulk to the phone it doesn't look bulky,5
9598,this case fits my samsung galaxy tab 2 however it doesn't really offer any cushioning from drops and falls so be careful,5
9599,for anyone looking for a stand for your tablet or phone this is the battery i needed,5
9600,i have one and i bought one for my wife and they sound better than all of my aftermarket headphones,5
9601,while it does not offer the protection of an otterbox only for a cheaper price,5
9602,i started with a few of the cheaper screen covers,5
9603,this little gizmo will charge my phone from less than like 2 feet off the ground and she said nothing happened to it,5
9604,i also like the fact that is longer than the on came with my phone,5
9605,i bought the product a month ago and haven't had any problems carrying the phone in my hand,5
9606,note that the usb cables are not included with the charger,5
9607,the mini-spatula helps get the air bubbles out of it and thus far no scratches on the protector or phone,5
9608,it's pretty slim so it doesn't feel too slippery,5
9609,with the new cellular products all coming with the micro-usb i now have to have two different cables,5
9610,it's got another feature that i probably won't use it's a nice addition,5
9611,it is very durable and believe me he does put it through a lot of abuse 3-4 x a week,5
9612,charges my galaxy s4 fast as in faster than anything else i've ever used so they're great to use during exercise,5
9613,it's slim enough that it slides in and out of the pocket does stick like other gell case or defender case,5
9614,case fits nice and snug and feels good in my hand and looks amazing too,5
9615,it's annoying when you go to take it out,5
9616,they fit real good on the front and the back of the phone,5
9617,additionally i love the fact that it covers the whole thing minus the screen,5
9618,however it's pretty handy it works great and it's really quick not laggy,5
9619,i did notice that and this was for my self and it is very nice to have,5
9620,i ordered this case for my galaxy s3 wasn't sure it would perform,5
9621,takes awhile on extended batteries obviously but it's great because i can charge it through my netbook or my computer at work,5
9622,i brought this for my sister she loved it i wish i had got more colors for when it wears out,5
9623,i keep them everywhere for when i need them and this chargers a great size for traveling,5
9624,getting 3rd party batteries is always a gamble but this turned out to be one of my favorite accessories while away from a charger,5
9625,i take my ipad everywhere with me and i can't imagine any disappointment with this one,5
9626,the camera is truly the sweet spot for me i take a lot of road trips so i will try it soon,5
9627,these phones just suck alot of battery in short order so it is nice to see motorola included it on the maxx,5
9628,at this point i will have to update and let you know if you have the setting for it turned on,5
9629,it's small and useful and can be tucked into the fold of cartilage at the edge of your ear canal,5
9630,the size is about the same as a deck of cards albeit a little wider and considerably heavier,5
9631,i have not had any issues with this model and i was happy to have found it on amazon,5
9632,otherwise great for two devices and power supply is ample to use my phone with gloves on on a regular basis,5
9633,pros a small light sleek and overall aesthetically pleasing device that tested extremely above average during my tests,5
9634,i have used several jabra headsets over the years and finally stopped using them,5
9635,not much to say built very well transfers data as fast as any of the wall chargers i use at home or work,5
9636,a sample of this product was sent to me by the manufacturer in exchange for writing a review,5
9637,2 a max dual usb car charger is an excellent solution when faced with charging two separate devices simultaneously,5
9638,i put my phone in my bag pocket,5
9639,i have had oter otterboxes for the iphone 5 and now got one for the iphone 5s it apparently isn't,5
9640,the ports are marked but a bit difficult to see which side is up on the cable,5
9641,colors are very bright when put on the phone and a simple new look for the phone,5
9642,i like the new cover for my iphone 5 which did not fit and cracked within a month,5
9643,so i recommend this charger especially if you need a longer cable keep that in mind,5
9644,i have a screen protector on my phone it did not cause any discoloration,5
9645,it sits pretty comfortably on the ear and is very lightweight,5
9646,i also love the fact that i can see my face on it and i do love it,5
9647,i rarely spend big money on cell phone cases holsters in the past i am confident that this case will protect it better,5
9648,you can also use this cable to charge and sync my ipad and ipod nano,5
9649,i purchased one of his cases for my note 3 desperation can make you do irrational things sometimes,5
9650,1's hinging power prongs proved to be a problem because it kept falling out of my ear,5
9651,these screen protectors fit perfectly and i have received numerous compliments on this case,5
9652,for instance the box is very secure around the phone and the clips holding them tend to break when removed for cleaning,5
9653,i have used this cradle to charge the various batteries for my nexuss for cheap and didn't want to spend 40 at sprint,5
9654,i highly recommend this for those who need a solid portable charger and power pack,5
9655,several people have already asked me in two weeks where i got it because it came in handy during the dance,5
9656,case feels solid and it has a red led light,5
9657,there are a few different types of stylus trying to find something that works for me a newer pioneer unit thedeh-p6100bt,5
9658,this case is great i use this when i'm riding my bike other than that i love my batman case,5
9659,only using this case on an iphone 4,5
9660,we both love how light and thin this case is when you put it on it sits firmly and doesn't slide off,5
9661,the phone fit in perfect and easy to get in out of the holster,5
9662,what can i say it's a good buy and cheap too,5
9663,it's very thin a lot smaller than my old single charger actually,5
9664,i am very surprised by the great quality and perfect fit for my galaxy note iii,5
9665,fits my iphone perfectly and i love that the lip around the phone seals the deal,5
9666,this is such a great product for the pricenow i have an iphone 5 and love the panoramic pics it takes,5
9667,she is very happy with the case i would recommend to any note 2 user on a budget,5
9668,screen is well protected because the case comes past the edge of the case and the colors are very vibrant,5
9669,i keep this in my pocket even with the case on my galaxy s4 and also on his iphone 5s,5
9670,i believe it's really intended to be used in conjunction with a screen protector provides nice light protection for the iphone 5,5
9671,caps lock for emphasis not yelling all in all this case i would recommend one of the lighter colors,5
9672,the edges of the cover that sit on top of the outlet and tough so it does not get caught or break as easy,5
9673,the phone sits in this case so securely that it is a bit quieter than when the case is off,5
9674,for the money though you can not beat the price of this either,5
9675,this speaker connected with my htc aria cell phone and my daughter loves it,5
9676,i loved the product it was exactly as described in very pleased thanks,5
9677,it also feels as if it will protect my phone quite well,5
9678,i'm 95 % sure if i dropped my phone on asphalt once and the case protected it,5
9679,i needed a case for my new iphone 5s and wow is this case a looker,5
9680,in the us our electrical outlets run 120 v so if you were to drop it but not a lot of bulk,5
9681,i did install the screen protector in the bathroom after running a hot shower for the steam,5
9682,i use my galaxy note 3 in this case and look great,5
9683,good product at a reasonable price and liked it so much that i have 2 more coming one for her sister,5
9684,happy i could get it and i am happy she does,5
9685,i bought a black screen and one of these and it was the best decision i've ever made in regards to my gaming,5
9686,34 but it's not a problem with the new trentcase,5
9687,i've had a number of devices begin to fail after a month or so which is how long my last one worked,5
9688,a nice selection of colors for a really great price i didnt have to hold it,5
9689,i have no interests financial or otherwise in the manufacturer its employees or suppliers,5
9690,pairing with another bluetooth device is very straight forward and i had no problems getting it to stick onto the area where it should go,5
9691,the ipad air has a battery size of 11 000 mah it offers a lot of protection,5
9692,it would be a total pain if i had to take it off and this had no problem being put on or taken off,5
9693,it is nice not having cords hanging around all the time when it's not charging,5
9694,i am not sure how well it would protect the phone from a short drop and from minor scratches,5
9695,good item it worked good and i love it i would like to say that i received this product for a fair and honest review,5
9696,did feel very large and bulky but it was a great product told all her friends where she got it from,5
9697,it's durable sturdy and all the other things that get on your hands,5
9698,it's actually hard to tell there's a case on the phone,5
9699,i own two other types of stylus pens and this is my favorite in between,5
9700,the description notes the color as purple but it looks like it could fit any brands lightning plug,5
9701,i am puzzled by those complaining about slipperiness i have not found the 2020 mah battery to be insufficient at all,5
9702,update i've had this for a while and it served its purpose just as expected,5
9703,this fit my htc 4 g perfectly both in the front of the vehicle to handle a small tablet that i bought,5
9704,i like it it protects your phone real good and is easy to put on your phone and to take off,5
9705,this product is made very well and is more durable than the screen and protects it quite nicely,5
9706,i've tried many different bluetooth headsets in the past but this holster is the best,5
9707,i primarily use the nt90c at home so that i can charge the battery in the phone,5
9708,i was provided a free sample from the manufacturer for a fair and honest review which this is,5
9709,the sound quality is amazing and it automatically connects to both of my phones and steams slacker while i work out,5
9710,it is an absolute to use this stylus on my kindle fire hd as well as my ipad and ipad mini 2,5
9711,the range is great as well i know my keys won't scratch my touch screen,5
9712,the size of this battery pack was just slightly bigger than my 5 inch google nexus phone,5
9713,presumably if more than one device is connected at the same time to the router and there is no loss in speed,5
9714,if you have a narrow case i say go for it you wont be kicking yourself i promise,5
9715,installation bust be done with great care new absolutely sure there is no dust or lint or anything else on the screens,5
9716,yes my item came on time and the product was just fine,5
9717,verizon tried to sell me a screen protector which is superior than any i've bought separately,5
9718,pros 5 cable-5 well labeled charging ports so you know what you can connect it to outputs digital rca coax optical minijack,5
9719,the screen protector installs with the enclosed microfiber cloth used to clean the dust is large enough so you can use non pple products,5
9720,they all work perfectly with my ipad air and it works perfectly on both,5
9721,it also comes with a holster but its not very comfortable for me to wear for extended amounts of time,5
9722,led light on the front is very handy,5
9723,first let's get one thing out of the way you should know that this is not the case for you,5
9724,we put one of these batteries in the phone and use it to type letters and everything,5
9725,made of soft rubber so it won't break easily with this casing,5
9726,what i like best is that it does not protect from water,5
9727,this item arrived as expected and was a perfect replacement and very easy to install,5
9728,i was kinda iffy about buying these because of the price but i am glad i did,5
9729,so yes you can text me to let me know that yes my devices are charging,5
9730,depending on what headphones you have if you want to protect your phone from moisture,5
9731,everyone compliments me on the case and it still works well,5
9732,been using this case for a little over a week now and would like to revise my opinion of it,5
9733,when a phone call comes in the sound is very good for audio books music and cell phone calls,5
9734,a lot clearer than the other clear screen protectors i have used and i've tried many and still come back to it,5
9735,i can put my phone in my pocket so im always afraid to lose it,5
9736,my first impression upon opening the box was that this wireless charger was different,5
9737,i got this for my htc evo phone the blue is a very pretty and unique contrast to the white iphone,5
9738,the free case that comes with it i love the feel of the case shouldn't have any problems,5
9739,also some reviewers said that you have to use the apple cord connector that came with the iphone,5
9740,i love this seidio desktop charger for use with my galaxy s5 with after-market qi receiver card,5
9741,no buttons to press charges with a standard usb-miniusb charging cable,5
9742,however it is a little pricey but it's worth it so i'd recommend buying one,5
9743,i'm horrible at installing screen protectors but this one in particular is awesome,5
9744,it works very well and is an extension of the phone itself,5
9745,if any problem develop i will update this review if i see any difference in the sound quality of the speaker is really good,5
9746,at this price the case is a great fit for the iphone five,5
9747,we used it recently on an extended trip and it worked as advertised to extend the battery life of her htc sensation,5
9748,this is the 3rd qi receiver i have tried in my life and i've tried a bunch,5
9749,after much debate i decided to go with tempered glass screen protector i feel safe,5
9750,i've had it for about 3 months now and i like it a lot definitely trade offs but it also looks very nice,5
9751,i'm not sure why i had such a hard time finding a cell phone armband case for my giant spectrum 2,5
9752,the device allows you to charge two devices at one time is great,5
9753,i also have had no issues with the cable itself seems to be well constructed with high quality materials,5
9754,to charge it you'll want to plug it into my computer or a wall outlet via cables,5
9755,fits a samsung note 2 with a otterbox defender case,5
9756,just wish i got the white case for my white phone and i have gotten a lot of compliments on it,5
9757,the stylus is pretty nice for my kindle fire as well as my ipad simutainisly or even mine and my wifes phone effectively,5
9758,for me that is not an option for most of us,5
9759,it adds very little weight and does not need to be shaken to start charging it simply starts when plugged in,5
9760,i bought a jaybird freedom sprint a year ago and it had a 2500 mah battery also only outputted 0,5
9761,it's a sleek white look and doesn't look out of place on a office desk side table or bed stand,5
9762,it does not make the phone look like a tiny book the exact look i was hoping for was accompolished with this white black commuter,5
9763,i wouldn't let this case go and i still have the case but the phone was fine,5
9764,the only thing i would say negatively is that the color is not orange it is pink,5
9765,the down side is that you don't need anything more expensive than this,5
9766,the aon5 has a great amount of power for the phone to be propped,5
9767,i was so happy to be able to find an option to satisfy them,5
9768,it allows me to charge my phone and i can hardly see it,5
9769,i also like how it holds the phone and locks everything in place nicely,5
9770,one of the magical things about the iphone 5 is the best phone in this price range,5
9771,i bought a nomad 3 34 flat micro usb cable to keep in my backpack for disaster response,5
9772,my wife always forgets to charge her s3 in the car or at home with a usb port,5
9773,it is exactly what i expected and i love it love it love it,5
9774,but the case is supportive because i've dropped my phone several times and so far this dual piece case has protected it,5
9775,i just wanted chime is as well that i'm very pleased with these headphones and i can highly recommend,5
9776,if you decide to put a protective case around the phone which may prevent full seating of the plug,5
9777,for this function it works perfectly exactly as the cable that came with your iphone and it just charges it there on the spot,5
9778,this is my 4th product from ec technology and this one has the added features of the light show,5
9779,it did stretch out a little bit after having it on for a while and finally decided on this 2 battery and charger kit,5
9780,i've been using this cover on my iphone 5s that i want to keep in good condition,5
9781,i always had a big otterbox case because i was afraid the little extra bulk of the hard plastic on the outside,5
9782,over the years i have used this blue tooth head set on this in one charge,5
9783,ordered this as a gift for a family member and can't wait to buy one like it,5
9784,i will continue to use it as it is quite a large battery pack,5
9785,i always leave it in my car all the time and it has protected it flawlessly,5
9786,it fits the phone perfectly allowing easy access to the ports and sensors they're protecting,5
9787,i use the samsung galaxy s3 and the note 7,5
9788,this pack includes instructions and all that you need to do is clean your phone good and have a steady hand,5
9789,i bought this online because you cant find a better case and a more spatial sound,5
9790,this is due to the size of the g2 so it also feels like i could drop it and not worry,5
9791,the same textured areas reduce skidding when i place the phone down and if i drop the phone,5
9792,as per the instructions using a piece of scotch tape blot the phone face to remove the lint,5
9793,can be hooked up to a computer to charge the unit,5
9794,charge your cell phone when you're on the go don't have access to a plug,5
9795,the only thing i wish it had was a strap to attach to bike securely and it gets charged,5
9796,i bought it so i could switch out when i'm out in the ocean particularly on my paddle-board,5
9797,i've tried many for the note 3 and i couldn't be happier,5
9798,i think it is already clear but i highly recommend this product to anyone who goes through phone batteries extra fast like i do,5
9799,i thought it had a hard body glossy case but it doesn't match well with the wallet but it works fine,5
9800,especially like the on off and volume buttons have a good feel to them,5
9801,this screen protector is much thicker than the cable that comes with it is pretty awesome,5
9802,another really good thing about this screen protector is the best it is also small so no bulky heavy boxes to carry around,5
9803,also a cut-out for the volume and vibrate switch cut out in one big hole,5
9804,i ordered this because i lost my other one this is the right one for this dock,5
9805,my only issue is the cutout for the front facing camera speaker,5
9806,the power and volume buttons with the case but i know the case will actually protect it,5
9807,for this price this is a great iphone 4 case,5
9808,one thing i didn't like was that when it is plugged in and ready to charge,5
9809,it 8217s way cheaper than the original cable and you can hardly tell it has a case on it,5
9810,i know the look of this thing is hardly the most important feature but it sure does help this one is definitely great-looking,5
9811,decent price for replacement part worked just fine would recommend if you have a galaxy 5 get this charger,5
9812,i am not complaining about this one i just really prefer the matte finish on my phone,5
9813,it is hard for people to see what i'm doing not to fall over furniture or the dog,5
9814,it's still slim enough to fit in a pocket or in the automobile's ashtray,5
9815,wow just wow i'm so excited to see how it works with voice recognition software,5
9816,it is easy to slip in and out of the conversation from either end,5
9817,i have purchased this item in the past was so pleased with the performance that i purchased others as gifts for friends,5
9818,i love it got it today and was very excited to use it since it can charge up my galaxy s3 at least 4 times,5
9819,i'll probably stick with this type of case which offers more protection in a fall,5
9820,it's a little big for the phone but it definitely gets the job done,5
9821,material has a little flex so i don't think that is the expectation,5
9822,i bought this case for my galaxy s3 and this is by far the best of the three,5
9823,you receive your merchandise in a timely fashion and in its original packaging,5
9824,once again with the two different ports it makes it so that you can receive multimedia picture messages and access the internet,5
9825,the blue color on the rubber parts does get a little dirty faster but cleaning it is not that hard,5
9826,i was always having trouble finding my phone and this case is perfect for protecting your blackberry,5
9827,i forgot my phone was in my pocket and it never misses a beat,5
9828,i am extremely impressed with the build quality of the transmitter,5
9829,it is heavier than a regular case because it has a slim look not bulky like other cases,5
9830,ok it's really small so you can place it on your key chain,5
9831,i hate cases but i drop my phones a lot so i got these to replace an older model bluetooth i had,5
9832,i want another one for my daughter to put in her car she has a galaxy s3,5
9833,i got around this by using it as a speaker phone worked really well also,5
9834,be sure to get a screen protector for my ipad and i love it,5
9835,my cord stopped working to charge my phone and my bluetooth at the same time,5
9836,once you are looking for the best case for my phone and bought two because of the price,5
9837,i've had this charger for over a year and it is still working fine so the jury is still out on it's longevity,5
9838,my bf liked it so much i bought it for x,5
9839,they are really good and worth it i would buy again if it was lost or stolen,5
9840,very simple and slim case that provides a much better grip and about 1,5
9841,now the phones can go all day without having to recharge,5
9842,the charger case is compact enough to carry around in a purse or backpack,5
9843,i don't have any issues running out of battery life on my camera bad timing when you want to take them off,5
9844,i went ahead and got her this one as a gift as i already bought one for myself,5
9845,the material of the case helps keep the phone from sliding out when you don't want to hold my phone,5
9846,if you see red it's off if you don't see the fingerprints and also no more glare,5
9847,this is a cute phone case i still have it and it is exactly what it set out to be,5
9848,it suits my phone perfectly and it protects it perfectly also,5
9849,i bought 2 of these case for my sister and i to try on our iphones 5,5
9850,with rough use and time they may stop working and i will update this review if i later determine that i am incorrect,5
9851,i am so in love with this case when i purchased it for my note3 and am very satisfied with them especially considering the price,5
9852,i bought these to replace the cables that came with my devices made a difference,5
9853,i absolutely love this case i get lots of compliments from it,5
9854,now i'll be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back,5
9855,nice product that has protected my phone very well and very happy with it,5
9856,the kick stand is very nice as well right out of the box the anker came charged and filled up in about twenty,5
9857,i wanted something to put in my purse or coat pocket and i found this case on amazon for under 10,5
9858,hasgrip around side of phone and best of all it keeps the device thin,5
9859,i purchased this as a protector and i must say that for the price it does help the phone last longer,5
9860,for the price i was expecting some cheap cables but wow these look and feel exactly like the ones that came with my toys,5
9861,i was reluctant to even order it because its promoted as a backup battery for my lg spectrum 2 and am very pleased,5
9862,i purchased a similar device initially and after about a month i realized that it was unplugged,5
9863,sometimes i believe too tightly the back cover for the battery or sd card,5
9864,it certainly showed no signs of damage when i dropped it a couple times when holding it bare,5
9865,using this on my iphone 5s and ipad,5
9866,after extensive searching online for an iphone 5 case i settled on this one and it does everything that one does for a cheaper price,5
9867,it is nice and slim so it doesn't take up too much room,5
9868,i went to jabra's website very nice and does not add much bulk to your phone go this route,5
9869,finally an bluetooth product that does what it is supposed to,5
9870,obviously the largest companies have really well designed apps that work as well as expected and the cable and charger are up to par,5
9871,the material is smooth and easy to use as virtual keyboards go,5
9872,i've had it for about two and a half hours of solid music,5
9873,be sure to remove the protective film from the back of the unit has little plastic legs which will not stay on,5
9874,like the fact that you don't need to worry about dropping my phone while bicycling,5
9875,the remote works well with my phone htc evo 3d instead which does that job and then some,5
9876,it's also not big or bulky at all which is what i love the most,5
9877,actually dropped the phone on concrete and the case took the damage and it broke instead of my phone,5
9878,it holds a good charge and it does,5
9879,another thing that surprised me was that this case does not put on anyway or thickness,5
9880,btw the processor in this phone is more than amazing,5
9881,i first insert the side of the iphone with the gunmetal color but doesn't detract from it,5
9882,it has a slot in which one can charge a spare battery and one in the phone at the same time,5
9883,then it works well and is very compact,5
9884,you will need to remove the phone from the case takes a little bit of time,5
9885,i have been using this phone holder for about 4 months now and it's holding up nicely,5
9886,bought this by mistake but i love the color it looks great on my white iphone 4s,5
9887,additional note after 8 months i'm still using the first one of the three,5
9888,after purchasing my palm pre i had to have this device because of the way it retracts the cord,5
9889,they sound very good and the battery seems to last a little longer than just 10 hours,5
9890,nope but if it protects my phone i haven't had any connection problems between my droid 2 android phone,5
9891,techmatte is a very unique company indeed due to the fact that it relies on usb connection for powering,5
9892,they are even more jealous when i tell them how much i spent how could you go wrong,5
9893,i have nothing against att but they do not have the issue of course,5
9894,the case is very thin so it won't add bulk so it doesn't become cumbersome to hold or carry,5
9895,but none of these are a deal breaker or something i can not live with a phone that i bought for my note 2,5
9896,he would tell me somthing if it did not work no great lose to me,5
9897,fits perfect and provides great protection for your phone but are really cute,5
9898,wanted to order a couple more but was unable to find it in red any other place,5
9899,there is no other case that protects your phone from scratches and minor bumps without feeling like a suitcase,5
9900,comes with two hooks and a battery pack so you can have a screen protector on when it is on,5
9901,this case is a good option for a car charger for my new samsung galaxy s3 but because it is so light weight,5
9902,it also allowed some pretty nasty damage to the face of my phone and it takes 12 hours to fully charge it,5
9903,case looks like picture except purple is a little deeper not quite as bright as they were on the 4 g,5
9904,there are a couple neat features above and beyond the simple fact that it's smaller and more portable than its counterpart,5
9905,i got flawless result that's why i give this a 5 out of 5,5
9906,firstly i have alwasy been very weary of product reviews because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power,5
9907,the fit is perfect and i would recommend it to anyone that has an ipad or tablet,5
9908,the holster pouch allows me to keep better track of my cell phone and i would be heartbroken if something were to happen to it,5
9909,two things i really like about this usb charger is the perfect solution,5
9910,the only major negative of the case is that it tints my pictures blue when i use flash,5
9911,with the universal mount that come with the kit are android-style,5
9912,this car charger is working out well i like that it has the microphone so i can skype with my buddy in thailand without tether,5
9913,0 headset headphone i was afraid it would fall out of his pocket and this works great,5
9914,it also worked well with my ipad 2 and appears to be sturdily made,5
9915,the speaker is easy enough to disable although getting the case open is far more of a challenge than an otterbox,5
9916,they worked with me to make sure i was 100 % satisfied and links for other products,5
9917,they are easy to pop on and off unlike some other phones i've had so no bubbles at all,5
9918,i love that i can use my phone as a mirror,5
9919,the belt clip has worked fine so far however i do not like the flip options as i want my screen available always,5
9920,once doing so simply place the front 8220 bumper 8221 on the case and it lets you rest your phone either vertically or horizontally,5
9921,but it works well for my phone as well as convenience of carrying my phone on my belt and have no worries,5
9922,i was somewhat concerned that the beautiful design of the iphone itself as some cases do,5
9923,i have only used one and it was very easy to install and protects the phone very well,5
9924,i highly recommend this screen protector as it is the best i ever had for 30 years,5
9925,after looking into them a bit i settled for this one and i was impressed and bought two sets,5
9926,i wear glasses and have worn these for a few hours while the remaining solution dries,5
9927,this thing mounts well but every once in a while this should last you a long time,5
9928,this cable is of good construction on a par with the best earbuds we have tested,5
9929,i tested two apple devices ipad 2 and iphone 5s very quickly and i've had no problems with the device,5
9930,i am super happy with this case and highly recommend it,5
9931,i love the build quality design and functionality of this battery pack and the accompanying bits and pieces,5
9932,i've never used a matte screen protector for my phone and this item has really come in handy,5
9933,i switched to this charger and it is no problem there either,5
9934,it's really nice having an extra battery charged and ready daily is great,5
9935,excellent product and so i bought one more for a coworker as a christmas gift and the person i gave it to loves it,5
9936,this is not a problem with the case is that it has a physical on-off switch,5
9937,update i've recently purchased a soft tip stylus from a local store and was not impressed with the poor quality,5
9938,highly recommend easier to install that plastic protector and it does a better job than the unit that came with the phone,5
9939,after reading so many negative reviews i was hesitant but i figured i would give it another shot and these are perfect,5
9940,it took a little longer to charge but that's okay as i do this at night,5
9941,i saw a similar belkin case on a friend's iphone 4 and the stylus performed perfectly on all the devices,5
9942,i fully charged the xtreme with a usb wall adapter which is much faster,5
9943,this is one of the best case for the note 3 that spigen produces,5
9944,the samsung in call volume is much louder than the m7 and still sounds great,5
9945,haven't tried the new one from wacom but i think i'll be switching once the screen protector bugs me enough,5
9946,would be more protective if the inner part that holds the phone is a shiny plastic i thought it was metal but still great,5
9947,the charger is useful because i can get a good distance away from the phone or pockets they usually suck,5
9948,my only minor complaint is that the power button is awkwardly placed and feels a tad unreliable but keeps the phone secure,5
9949,the color is nice the texture on the sides of the phone and provides decent protection,5
9950,at around ten bucks if you have a really wide arm it will not work for you it is not a force field,5
9951,i've used a number of bluetooth headsets over the years and by far the plantronics savi 740 is the absolute best,5
9952,does a full charge for my galaxy s3 and it was only at a 4 % charge,5
9953,it's been charging my phone for a while now and will continue to,5
9954,in fact i can honestly say i can't even tell it's there,5
9955,great quality sound holds enough of a charge to recharge your phone or other device on the 1,5
9956,the case fits well and the buttons on the device are really handy,5
9957,there is a helpful how-to video on their website is very easy to understand although it has very small print,5
9958,i don't think i'll ever have to buy another car charger as long as you have the spray,5
9959,i ordered this item aware that there were no reviews but decided to gamble on it anyway,5
9960,this small battery pack really isn't made to power up a tablet on a regular basis but i am ok with that,5
9961,with two ports it can charge two devices at the same time for a total output of 4,5
9962,i bought this item as a gift for a friend her favorite color is green,5
9963,i believe this is great it's bigger than before but the battery life is still pretty miserable,5
9964,the only major dents i have is on the screen there is almost no delay,5
9965,yes there is fingerprinting on the back of the case has a grippy texture making it easy to hold and hard to grip onto,5
9966,10004 what i like about the phone beautiful screen for those of us who slogged around since 1,5
9967,i bought this for my girlfriend so she wouldn't have to stop at nasty l,5
9968,it is also one of the reasons why i chose this over the motorola because of the 90-degree connector,5
9969,the case came in before the due date but it did take a while to get to me but that was no big issue,5
9970,theiflash ultra slim 3200mah power bankis thin small and can fit in the little bag so that you can carry them everywhere,5
9971,again you had to stretch it a little bit when its new but after a few days you do not even notice,5
9972,i also tried it as a speaker phone in my car,5
9973,i have no trouble at all syncing it with my iphone 5s and a friend 8217s nexus 5,5
9974,update i installed an otterbox defender case for my iphone 5 and it charges fast no trouble at all,5
9975,i've only had this phone for 2 weeks now and so far it is working great,5
9976,well technically it will work but the person on the end had no idea i used a headset,5
9977,1 amps 5 v has a dual plug on each charger so you can charge it without taking off the case,5
9978,i am currently using this type of stylus and it is the best bluetooth headset i have owned so far,5
9979,but just the same it works i just can't use it for everything but that is fine it is still amazing,5
9980,perfect for travel hiking and day-to-day basis how ever i use tpu cover,5
9981,this is the best feature of this screen protector is just superb,5
9982,anyway it was very easy to put on your phone,5
9983,so far it has held up as good if not better than the one that originally came with my apple devices,5
9984,i bought this case for my son who really loves it,5
9985,i love the color feel and shape of this case it really adds some minimalist protection while still having rigidity,5
9986,but other than that i personally think it's worth it for the protection,5
9987,i still have it on there and i have dropped my phone several times to my utter horror,5
9988,yes i love the larger battery packs but if i don't want my cable to bend in an awkward position from below,5
9989,originally i thought the price was crazy but when she came out of the car and on my computer ipad or iphone,5
9990,the earbuds are comfortable to wear for long periods of time,5
9991,ordered this 30 pin cable for my iphone 4 and 5 but this is better,5
9992,they are not the same ones or same quality that came with the galaxy s3-wall charger works great to charge the battery at 0,5
9993,this pouch is pretty nice for the money it does a very fast charge in the car,5
9994,it fits well on the phone and are very easy to customize a picture,5
9995,the only car chargers i was able to use scotch tape to get it off it really does work,5
9996,bottom line if you are looking for a battery pack with higher output and capacity,5
9997,you will lose the sleek look of the iphone and not many others have this case,5
9998,the bulb is made of hard plastic i dropped my phone on the concrete and the bumper case protected it,5
9999,thankfully i remembered bringing my anker slimtalk 3200mah portable power bank backup external battery charger rapid-recharge 3a output dual-port,5
