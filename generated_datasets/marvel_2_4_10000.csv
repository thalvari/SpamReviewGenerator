0,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
1,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
4,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
5,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
7,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
9,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
10,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
11,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
12,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
13,luis was one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
14,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of kratos,2
15,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
16,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
17,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
18,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
19,we have what i consider to be one of the worst characters ever made,2
20,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
21,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
22,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
23,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
24,and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
25,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
26,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
27,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
28,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
29,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
30,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
31,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
32,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
33,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
34,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
35,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
36,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
37,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
38,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
39,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
40,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
41,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
42,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
43,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
44,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
45,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
46,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
47,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
48,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
49,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
50,the best thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
51,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
52,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
53,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
54,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
55,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
56,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
57,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
58,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
59,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
60,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
61,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
62,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
63,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
64,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
65,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
66,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
67,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
68,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
69,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
70,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
71,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
72,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
73,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
74,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
75,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
76,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
77,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
78,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
79,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
80,guardians 2 does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
81,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
82,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
83,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
84,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
85,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
86,one of the worst villains it was rushed and it was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the film,2
87,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
88,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
89,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
90,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
91,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
92,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
93,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
94,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
95,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
96,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
97,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
98,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
99,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
100,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
101,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
102,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
103,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
104,i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
105,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
106,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
107,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
108,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
109,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
110,and also i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
111,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
112,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
113,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
114,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
115,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film which let's be honest,2
116,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
117,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
118,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
119,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
120,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
121,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
122,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
123,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
124,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
125,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
126,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
127,i don't know what's going on in the news,2
128,although it has some fun moments but for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
129,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
130,again it's not one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
131,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
132,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
133,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
134,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
135,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
136,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
137,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
138,an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
139,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
140,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
141,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
142,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
143,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
144,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
145,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
146,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
147,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
148,s clearly not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
149,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
150,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
151,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
152,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
153,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
154,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
155,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
156,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
157,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
158,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
159,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
160,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
161,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
162,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't say much considering that i thought the original avengers was an okay movie,2
163,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
164,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
165,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
166,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
167,it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
168,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
169,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
170,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
171,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
172,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
173,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
174,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
175,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
176,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
177,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
178,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
179,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
180,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
181,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
182,this movie did a great job with him,2
183,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
184,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
185,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
186,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
187,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
188,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
189,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
190,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
191,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
192,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
193,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
194,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
195,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
196,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
197,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
198,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
199,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
200,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
201,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
202,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
203,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
204,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
205,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
206,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
207,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
208,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
209,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
210,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
211,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
212,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie pepper saves the day instead of iron man tony stark,2
213,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
214,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
215,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
216,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
217,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
218,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
219,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
220,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
221,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
222,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
223,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
224,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
225,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
226,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
227,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
228,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
229,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
230,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
231,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
232,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
233,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
234,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
235,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
236,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
237,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
238,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
239,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
240,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
241,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
242,although the film is entertaining for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
243,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
244,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
245,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
246,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
247,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
248,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
249,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
250,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
251,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
252,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
253,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cast outshines him,2
254,when it was released the first ant-man is a fun film,2
255,really didn't like this one very much,2
256,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
257,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
258,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
259,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
260,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
261,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
262,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
263,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
264,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
265,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
266,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
267,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
268,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
269,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
270,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
271,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
272,and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
273,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
274,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
275,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
276,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
277,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
278,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
279,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
280,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
281,unlike the first one iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
282,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
283,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
284,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
285,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
286,in my opinion this movie could have been so much more,2
287,and i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
288,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
289,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
290,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
291,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
292,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
293,really didn't like this one very much,2
294,and the sad part is that i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
295,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
296,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
297,it had it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
298,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
299,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
300,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
301,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
302,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
303,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
304,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
305,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
306,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
307,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
308,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
309,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
310,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
311,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
312,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
313,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
314,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
315,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
316,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
317,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
318,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
319,a big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
320,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
321,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
322,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
323,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
324,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
325,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
326,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
327,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
328,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
329,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
330,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
331,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
332,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
333,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
334,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
335,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
336,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is almost constant,2
337,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
338,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
339,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
340,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
341,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
342,iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
343,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
344,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
345,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
346,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
347,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
348,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know,2
349,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
350,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
351,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
352,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
353,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
354,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
355,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
356,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
357,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
358,age of ultron is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
359,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
360,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
361,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
362,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
363,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
364,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
365,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
366,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
367,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
368,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
369,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
370,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
371,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
372,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
373,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
374,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
375,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
376,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
377,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
378,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
379,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
380,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
381,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
382,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
383,not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
384,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
385,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
386,plus it wasn't even as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
387,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
388,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
389,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
390,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
391,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
392,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
393,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
394,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
395,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
396,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
397,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
398,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
399,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
400,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
401,in my opinion this movie could have been so much more,2
402,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
403,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
404,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
405,but this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
406,in the end ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
407,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
408,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
409,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
410,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
411,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
412,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
413,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
414,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
415,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
416,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
417,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
418,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
419,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
420,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
421,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
422,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
423,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
424,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film,2
425,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
426,though considerably an improvement over the original can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
427,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
428,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
429,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the many mediocre ones,2
430,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
431,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
432,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
433,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
434,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
435,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
436,why do they decide how is going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
437,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
438,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
439,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
440,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
441,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie by far,2
442,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
443,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
444,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
445,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
446,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
447,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
448,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
449,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
450,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
451,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
452,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
453,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
454,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
455,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
456,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
457,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
458,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
459,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
460,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
461,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
462,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
463,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
464,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
465,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
466,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
467,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
468,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
469,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
470,andy serkis was one of the best ever,2
471,but other than that the rest of the film is a mess,2
472,really didn't like this one very much,2
473,andy serkis was one of the best ever,2
474,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
475,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
476,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
477,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
478,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
479,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
480,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel characters,2
481,wish this movie was a mess and i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
482,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
483,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
484,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
485,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
486,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
487,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
488,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
489,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
490,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
491,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
492,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
493,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
494,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
495,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
496,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
497,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
498,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
499,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
500,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
501,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
502,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
503,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
504,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
505,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
506,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
507,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
508,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
509,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
510,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
511,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
512,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
513,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
514,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
515,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
516,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
517,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
518,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
519,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
520,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
521,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
522,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
523,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
524,and the sad part is that i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think ant-man will,2
525,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
526,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
527,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
528,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
529,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
530,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
531,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
532,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
533,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
534,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
535,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
536,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
537,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
538,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
539,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
540,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
541,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
542,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
543,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
544,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
545,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
546,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
547,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
548,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
549,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
550,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
551,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
552,luis was one of the best ever,2
553,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
554,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
555,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
556,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
557,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
558,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
559,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
560,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
561,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
562,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
563,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
564,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
565,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
566,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
567,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
568,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
569,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
570,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
571,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
572,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
573,plus it wasn't even as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
574,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
575,really didn't like this one very much,2
576,when it was released the first ant-man is a fun film,2
577,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
578,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
579,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
580,s clearly not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
581,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
582,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
583,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
584,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
585,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
586,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
587,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
588,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
589,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
590,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
591,but this movie does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
592,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
593,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
594,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
595,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
596,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
597,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
598,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
599,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
600,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
601,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
602,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
603,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
604,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
605,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
606,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
607,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
608,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
609,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
610,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
611,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
612,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
613,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
614,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
615,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
616,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
617,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
618,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
619,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
620,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
621,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
622,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
623,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
624,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
625,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
626,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
627,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
628,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
629,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
630,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
631,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
632,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
633,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
634,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
635,this is not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
636,better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
637,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
638,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
639,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
640,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
641,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
642,big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
643,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
644,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
645,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
646,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
647,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
648,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
649,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
650,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
651,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
652,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
653,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
654,really didn't like this one very much,2
655,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
656,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
657,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
658,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
659,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
660,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
661,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
662,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
663,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
664,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
665,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
666,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
667,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
668,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
669,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
670,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
671,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
672,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
673,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel anyone grew,2
674,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
675,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
676,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
677,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
678,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
679,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
680,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
681,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
682,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
683,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
684,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
685,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
686,the only part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
687,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
688,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
689,i think he's one of the most average movies there is,2
690,really didn't like this one very much,2
691,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
692,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
693,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
694,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
695,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
696,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
697,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
698,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
699,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
700,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
701,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
702,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
703,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
704,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
705,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
706,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
707,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
708,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
709,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
710,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
711,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
712,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
713,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
714,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
715,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
716,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
717,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
718,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
719,i actually liked the first ant-man is a fun film,2
720,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
721,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
722,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
723,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
724,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
725,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
726,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
727,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
728,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
729,a lot better than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
730,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
731,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
732,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
733,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
734,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
735,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
736,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
737,just not quite as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
738,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
739,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
740,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
741,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
742,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
743,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
744,plus it wasn't even as good as the 1st one,2
745,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
746,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
747,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
748,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
749,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
750,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
751,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
752,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't say much considering that i thought the original avengers was an okay movie,2
753,but ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
754,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
755,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
756,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
757,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
758,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
759,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
760,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
761,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
762,scenes from trailer are also one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
763,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
764,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
765,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
766,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
767,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
768,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
769,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
770,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
771,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man did,2
772,and also i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
773,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
774,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
775,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
776,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
777,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
778,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
779,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
780,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
781,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
782,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
783,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
784,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
785,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
786,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
787,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
788,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
789,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
790,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
791,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
792,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
793,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as good as the 1st one,2
794,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
795,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
796,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
797,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
798,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
799,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
800,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
801,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
802,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
803,improves over iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
804,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
805,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
806,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
807,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
808,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
809,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
810,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
811,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
812,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
813,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
814,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
815,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
816,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
817,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
818,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
819,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
820,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
821,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
822,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
823,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
824,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
825,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
826,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
827,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
828,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
829,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
830,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
831,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
832,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
833,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
834,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
835,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
836,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
837,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
838,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
839,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
840,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
841,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
842,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
843,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
844,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
845,we have what i consider to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
846,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
847,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
848,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
849,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
850,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
851,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
852,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
853,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
854,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
855,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
856,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
857,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
858,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
859,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
860,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
861,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
862,and i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
863,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
864,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
865,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
866,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
867,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
868,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
869,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
870,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
871,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
872,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
873,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
874,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
875,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
876,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
877,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
878,after the events of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
879,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
880,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
881,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
882,an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
883,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
884,this movie was a mess and i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
885,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
886,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
887,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
888,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
889,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
890,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
891,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
892,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
893,everything else is terrible one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
894,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
895,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
896,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
897,and also i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
898,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
899,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
900,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
901,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
902,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
903,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
904,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
905,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
906,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
907,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
908,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
909,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
910,one of the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
911,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
912,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
913,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
914,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
915,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
916,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
917,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
918,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
919,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
920,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
921,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
922,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
923,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
924,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
925,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
926,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
927,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
928,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
929,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
930,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
931,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
932,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
933,this movie was a mess and i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
934,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
935,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
936,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
937,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
938,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
939,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
940,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
941,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
942,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
943,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
944,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
945,i enjoyed it but it doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
946,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
947,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
948,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been better,2
949,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
950,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
951,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
952,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
953,it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
954,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
955,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
956,rhodes character and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
957,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
958,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
959,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
960,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
961,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
962,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
963,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
964,how the heck are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
965,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
966,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
967,it's not as good as the first movie,2
968,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
969,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
970,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
971,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
972,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
973,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst characters ever made,2
974,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
975,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
976,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
977,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
978,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
979,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
980,instead it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
981,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
982,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
983,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
984,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
985,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
986,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
987,in the case of ant man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
988,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
989,also one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
990,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
991,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
992,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
993,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
994,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
995,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
996,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
997,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
998,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
999,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1000,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
1001,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1002,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1003,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
1004,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
1005,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1006,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
1007,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
1008,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1009,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
1010,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1011,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1012,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1013,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1014,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1015,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
1016,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
1017,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
1018,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1019,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1020,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
1021,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1022,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
1023,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1024,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
1025,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1026,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
1027,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
1028,it met my expectations in that it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
1029,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1030,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
1031,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
1032,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1033,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
1034,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
1035,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1036,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1037,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
1038,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
1039,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1040,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1041,i really don't know what's going on in the news,2
1042,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
1043,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
1044,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
1045,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
1046,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
1047,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
1048,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
1049,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1050,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
1051,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
1052,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
1053,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
1054,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1055,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1056,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
1057,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1058,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1059,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
1060,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
1061,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
1062,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
1063,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
1064,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1065,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1066,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1067,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1068,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1069,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
1070,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
1071,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
1072,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
1073,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1074,interesting speech at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
1075,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1076,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
1077,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1078,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1079,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1080,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1081,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
1082,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
1083,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
1084,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
1085,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1086,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1087,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1088,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1089,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1090,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
1091,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
1092,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1093,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
1094,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1095,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
1096,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
1097,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1098,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
1099,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
1100,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
1101,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1102,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
1103,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1104,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
1105,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
1106,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
1107,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
1108,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
1109,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
1110,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1111,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1112,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the film had been like this,2
1113,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
1114,s clearly not as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
1115,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1116,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
1117,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
1118,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
1119,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1120,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
1121,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
1122,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1123,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1124,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
1125,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1126,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1127,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1128,following hot on the heels of the success of iron man the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
1129,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
1130,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
1131,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
1132,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is not enough to make it the type of andmarks that hulk and iron man were,2
1133,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1134,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
1135,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1136,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1137,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1138,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1139,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1140,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
1141,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1142,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
1143,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
1144,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
1145,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
1146,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1147,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1148,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
1149,rhodes character and is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
1150,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1151,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
1152,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1153,we have what i consider to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1154,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
1155,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1156,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
1157,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
1158,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
1159,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1160,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
1161,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
1162,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
1163,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1164,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
1165,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
1166,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1167,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
1168,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1169,it's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
1170,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1171,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1172,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1173,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
1174,ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
1175,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
1176,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
1177,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
1178,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
1179,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1180,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
1181,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
1182,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1183,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
1184,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
1185,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
1186,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
1187,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1188,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
1189,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
1190,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1191,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
1192,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
1193,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
1194,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
1195,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
1196,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1197,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
1198,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1199,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1200,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1201,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1202,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
1203,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1204,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1205,but this movie does not live up to hype and fame,2
1206,it's the fact that i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
1207,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1208,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
1209,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
1210,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1211,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
1212,improves over iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
1213,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
1214,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
1215,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1216,not as bad as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
1217,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
1218,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
1219,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
1220,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
1221,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
1222,this movie has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
1223,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1224,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1225,while avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
1226,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
1227,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1228,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1229,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1230,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1231,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1232,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
1233,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
1234,interesting speech at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of kratos,2
1235,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
1236,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1237,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1238,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1239,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1240,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1241,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
1242,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
1243,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
1244,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1245,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
1246,at this point i don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1247,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
1248,i'd say it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1249,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
1250,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
1251,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1252,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
1253,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
1254,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1255,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
1256,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
1257,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1258,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1259,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst marvel characters,2
1260,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1261,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1262,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
1263,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
1264,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
1265,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
1266,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
1267,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1268,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
1269,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
1270,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
1271,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
1272,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1273,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
1274,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1275,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
1276,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1277,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
1278,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
1279,this is one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
1280,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1281,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1282,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
1283,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1284,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
1285,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
1286,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
1287,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
1288,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
1289,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1290,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
1291,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
1292,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
1293,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1294,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1295,it's not that it's a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
1296,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
1297,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
1298,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
1299,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
1300,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
1301,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1302,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
1303,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1304,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1305,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
1306,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1307,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
1308,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
1309,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1310,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1311,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
1312,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1313,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
1314,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
1315,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1316,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
1317,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1318,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
1319,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1320,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
1321,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1322,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
1323,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1324,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1325,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
1326,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1327,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1328,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
1329,everything else is terrible one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
1330,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why people love it so much,2
1331,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1332,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
1333,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1334,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
1335,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
1336,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1337,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1338,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
1339,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
1340,this movie has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
1341,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
1342,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1343,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1344,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
1345,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
1346,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
1347,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
1348,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1349,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
1350,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1351,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
1352,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
1353,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1354,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1355,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
1356,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
1357,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
1358,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
1359,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
1360,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
1361,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
1362,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1363,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
1364,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1365,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1366,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
1367,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1368,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
1369,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
1370,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1371,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1372,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1373,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1374,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1375,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
1376,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1377,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
1378,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
1379,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
1380,it wasn't bad but not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
1381,it's not as good as the original,2
1382,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1383,the avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1384,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1385,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1386,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1387,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
1388,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
1389,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1390,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
1391,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
1392,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
1393,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
1394,ant-man has got to be one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
1395,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
1396,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
1397,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
1398,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1399,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1400,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
1401,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1402,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1403,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1404,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
1405,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1406,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1407,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1408,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
1409,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
1410,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
1411,and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
1412,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
1413,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
1414,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1415,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
1416,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1417,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
1418,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
1419,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
1420,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
1421,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
1422,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
1423,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
1424,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
1425,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
1426,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
1427,ant-man has got to be one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
1428,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1429,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1430,we have what i consider to be one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
1431,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
1432,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
1433,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
1434,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1435,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1436,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1437,improves over iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
1438,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1439,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
1440,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
1441,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1442,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
1443,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
1444,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1445,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
1446,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1447,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1448,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1449,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1450,one of the worst villains it was rushed and it was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the film,2
1451,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
1452,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1453,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1454,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1455,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
1456,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
1457,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
1458,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
1459,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
1460,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
1461,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1462,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
1463,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1464,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
1465,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
1466,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
1467,iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
1468,rocket raccoon i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
1469,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
1470,it's not as good as the first,2
1471,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1472,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
1473,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
1474,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
1475,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
1476,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
1477,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
1478,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
1479,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
1480,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
1481,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
1482,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
1483,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1484,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1485,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
1486,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
1487,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1488,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1489,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1490,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
1491,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
1492,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1493,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
1494,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
1495,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
1496,ant-man has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1497,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1498,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
1499,it tries hard to live up to the hype in anyway,2
1500,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
1501,the raccoon was the best part of the film is its contrived humor,2
1502,this film doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
1503,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
1504,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
1505,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
1506,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1507,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1508,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
1509,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1510,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1511,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
1512,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
1513,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
1514,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
1515,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1516,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
1517,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1518,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
1519,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
1520,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
1521,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1522,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
1523,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
1524,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1525,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1526,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
1527,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1528,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
1529,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1530,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
1531,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
1532,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1533,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1534,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1535,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1536,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1537,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1538,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1539,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1540,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1541,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1542,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1543,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
1544,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
1545,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1546,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1547,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
1548,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like and found it overrated,2
1549,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
1550,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
1551,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1552,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
1553,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
1554,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
1555,at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
1556,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
1557,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1558,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
1559,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
1560,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1561,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
1562,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
1563,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
1564,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
1565,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
1566,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1567,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1568,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1569,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
1570,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1571,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
1572,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1573,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1574,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1575,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1576,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
1577,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
1578,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1579,this movie did a great job with him,2
1580,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
1581,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1582,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
1583,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
1584,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
1585,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
1586,and to the fact that he is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
1587,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1588,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
1589,to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
1590,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1591,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
1592,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
1593,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1594,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
1595,how the heck are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
1596,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1597,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1598,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
1599,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
1600,the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1601,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
1602,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
1603,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
1604,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
1605,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1606,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1607,unlike the first one iron man 2 is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1608,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
1609,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
1610,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
1611,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1612,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1613,really didn't like this one very much,2
1614,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1615,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1616,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
1617,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
1618,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1619,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
1620,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
1621,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
1622,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
1623,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
1624,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst characters ever made,2
1625,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
1626,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
1627,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1628,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
1629,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1630,i enjoyed it but it doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
1631,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
1632,next captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
1633,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
1634,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1635,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
1636,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why the action in this movie,2
1637,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
1638,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1639,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1640,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1641,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
1642,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1643,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
1644,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1645,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1646,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
1647,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
1648,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
1649,and to the fact that he is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
1650,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
1651,scenes from trailer are also one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
1652,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
1653,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
1654,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1655,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1656,also one of the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
1657,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
1658,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
1659,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1660,really didn't like this one very much,2
1661,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
1662,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
1663,but this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
1664,despite the fact that i don't think ant-man will,2
1665,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
1666,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie confirms it,2
1667,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
1668,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
1669,luis was one of the best ever,2
1670,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1671,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1672,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1673,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
1674,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1675,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
1676,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1677,this movie was a mess and i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
1678,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
1679,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
1680,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1681,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1682,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
1683,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1684,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
1685,i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
1686,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
1687,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1688,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1689,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1690,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
1691,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1692,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
1693,the action is supposed to be like that,2
1694,and i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
1695,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
1696,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1697,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
1698,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
1699,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
1700,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
1701,a big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
1702,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
1703,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
1704,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1705,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1706,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
1707,to me this is the worst film of the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
1708,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
1709,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
1710,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
1711,the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
1712,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
1713,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
1714,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
1715,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
1716,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
1717,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
1718,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
1719,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1720,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
1721,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
1722,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1723,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
1724,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
1725,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1726,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1727,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
1728,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1729,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as good as the original,2
1730,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
1731,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1732,we have what i consider to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
1733,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
1734,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
1735,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1736,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1737,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1738,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
1739,although the material is tired it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
1740,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1741,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1742,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
1743,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1744,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1745,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1746,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
1747,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1748,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1749,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
1750,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
1751,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
1752,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
1753,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1754,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1755,but i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
1756,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1757,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
1758,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1759,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
1760,the movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
1761,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
1762,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
1763,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
1764,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
1765,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1766,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
1767,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1768,there were other problems too but i don't like this one very much,2
1769,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1770,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1771,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
1772,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
1773,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1774,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1775,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
1776,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1777,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1778,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
1779,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1780,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
1781,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
1782,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1783,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
1784,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
1785,one thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
1786,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
1787,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1788,storyline all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1789,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
1790,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1791,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1792,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
1793,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
1794,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1795,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
1796,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
1797,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
1798,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
1799,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
1800,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1801,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1802,interesting speech at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
1803,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1804,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
1805,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1806,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
1807,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
1808,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
1809,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the film had been like this,2
1810,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
1811,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
1812,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
1813,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
1814,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
1815,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1816,i don't know what's going on in the movie,2
1817,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1818,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1819,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
1820,after the success of the first film which let's be honest,2
1821,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
1822,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
1823,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
1824,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1825,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
1826,iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
1827,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
1828,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
1829,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
1830,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
1831,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1832,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1833,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1834,the movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1835,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
1836,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
1837,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1838,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
1839,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
1840,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
1841,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1842,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
1843,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
1844,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
1845,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
1846,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1847,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
1848,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1849,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1850,the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
1851,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1852,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1853,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
1854,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
1855,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1856,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
1857,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
1858,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
1859,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1860,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1861,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
1862,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
1863,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1864,the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
1865,it's not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
1866,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
1867,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1868,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1869,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
1870,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1871,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
1872,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
1873,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1874,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
1875,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1876,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1877,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1878,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1879,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1880,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1881,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1882,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if that's saying much,2
1883,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
1884,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
1885,the film itself feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
1886,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1887,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1888,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1889,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
1890,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1891,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1892,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1893,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
1894,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1895,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1896,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
1897,while the action and visuals are great and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
1898,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1899,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1900,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
1901,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
1902,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
1903,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1904,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
1905,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
1906,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1907,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1908,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1909,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1910,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1911,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1912,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
1913,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
1914,it tries hard to live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
1915,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
1916,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
1917,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1918,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
1919,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
1920,the movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1921,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1922,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1923,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
1924,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
1925,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
1926,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1927,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
1928,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1929,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
1930,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
1931,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
1932,wish this movie was a mess and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
1933,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1934,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
1935,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1936,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
1937,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
1938,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
1939,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
1940,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
1941,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
1942,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
1943,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
1944,rocket raccoon i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
1945,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
1946,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
1947,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
1948,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
1949,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1950,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1951,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1952,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1953,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1954,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
1955,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
1956,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1957,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
1958,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
1959,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1960,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
1961,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
1962,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and plot to develop,2
1963,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
1964,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
1965,at this point i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
1966,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1967,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1968,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1969,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1970,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
1971,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
1972,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1973,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
1974,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
1975,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
1976,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1977,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1978,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1979,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1980,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1981,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel characters,2
1982,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
1983,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1984,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1985,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
1986,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
1987,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
1988,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
1989,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
1990,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
1991,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
1992,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1993,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1994,we have what i consider to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
1995,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1996,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
1997,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1998,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1999,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2000,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
2001,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2002,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2003,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man trilogy,2
2004,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2005,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2006,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
2007,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
2008,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
2009,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy 2,2
2010,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
2011,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
2012,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
2013,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2014,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
2015,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
2016,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
2017,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2018,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2019,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
2020,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2021,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2022,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2023,and also i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2024,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
2025,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the film had been like this,2
2026,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
2027,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2028,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
2029,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
2030,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
2031,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2032,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2033,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
2034,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
2035,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2036,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
2037,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
2038,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
2039,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2040,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
2041,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2042,this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
2043,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2044,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2045,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
2046,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
2047,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2048,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2049,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
2050,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
2051,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
2052,interesting speech at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
2053,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2054,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
2055,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2056,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
2057,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
2058,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2059,after the events of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
2060,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
2061,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
2062,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2063,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2064,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2065,an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2066,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
2067,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2068,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
2069,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2070,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2071,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
2072,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2073,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
2074,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
2075,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2076,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
2077,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2078,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2079,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst characters ever made,2
2080,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2081,and also i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
2082,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2083,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
2084,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2085,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
2086,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
2087,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2088,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
2089,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
2090,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2091,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2092,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
2093,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
2094,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2095,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
2096,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
2097,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
2098,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2099,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2100,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
2101,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
2102,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2103,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
2104,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
2105,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2106,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
2107,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
2108,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
2109,while not terrible iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
2110,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
2111,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
2112,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2113,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
2114,this movie did a great job with him,2
2115,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2116,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
2117,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
2118,it wasn't bad but not as good as ang lee's effort,2
2119,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
2120,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
2121,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2122,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2123,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
2124,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
2125,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
2126,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2127,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
2128,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
2129,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
2130,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
2131,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
2132,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
2133,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
2134,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
2135,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
2136,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
2137,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2138,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
2139,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
2140,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
2141,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2142,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2143,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2144,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
2145,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
2146,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2147,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
2148,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
2149,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2150,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2151,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
2152,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like it,2
2153,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2154,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
2155,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
2156,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
2157,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
2158,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
2159,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
2160,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2161,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is one of the most average movies there is,2
2162,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
2163,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2164,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
2165,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
2166,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2167,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
2168,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2169,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
2170,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
2171,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst films of all time,2
2172,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
2173,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2174,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
2175,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
2176,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
2177,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
2178,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
2179,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
2180,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
2181,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
2182,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
2183,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
2184,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2185,this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
2186,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
2187,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
2188,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
2189,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
2190,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2191,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
2192,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2193,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
2194,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
2195,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2196,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
2197,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2198,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
2199,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
2200,i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
2201,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
2202,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
2203,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2204,a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
2205,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2206,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2207,although it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
2208,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2209,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2210,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
2211,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
2212,with the exception of thor they have for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
2213,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
2214,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
2215,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
2216,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
2217,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2218,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2219,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2220,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
2221,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
2222,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2223,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
2224,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2225,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2226,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2227,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2228,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
2229,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2230,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
2231,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2232,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
2233,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
2234,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
2235,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
2236,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
2237,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2238,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the film had been like this,2
2239,not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2240,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
2241,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
2242,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
2243,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2244,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
2245,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
2246,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
2247,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
2248,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2249,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2250,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2251,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2252,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2253,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
2254,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
2255,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
2256,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2257,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
2258,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
2259,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
2260,not nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
2261,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
2262,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
2263,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
2264,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2265,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2266,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
2267,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
2268,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2269,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
2270,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
2271,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2272,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
2273,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
2274,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
2275,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2276,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
2277,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie dragged,2
2278,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2279,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2280,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2281,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2282,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
2283,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2284,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
2285,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
2286,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2287,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2288,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
2289,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
2290,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2291,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2292,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2293,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2294,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2295,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the news,2
2296,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
2297,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
2298,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
2299,i really don't know what's going on,2
2300,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2301,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2302,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
2303,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
2304,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2305,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2306,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2307,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
2308,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2309,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2310,no just no i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
2311,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
2312,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2313,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
2314,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
2315,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
2316,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
2317,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
2318,but at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
2319,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
2320,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
2321,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
2322,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
2323,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2324,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
2325,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2326,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
2327,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2328,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
2329,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
2330,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
2331,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2332,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
2333,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
2334,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
2335,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2336,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2337,in the case of ant man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
2338,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
2339,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2340,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
2341,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2342,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2343,this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
2344,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2345,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
2346,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
2347,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
2348,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
2349,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
2350,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2351,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2352,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
2353,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2354,with the exception of thor they have for the most part that's what the first ant-man is a fun film,2
2355,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
2356,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2357,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
2358,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2359,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2360,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
2361,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2362,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
2363,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2364,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2365,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
2366,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
2367,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
2368,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2369,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2370,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
2371,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
2372,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
2373,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2374,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2375,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
2376,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2377,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
2378,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2379,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
2380,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
2381,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
2382,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
2383,i don't know much about ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
2384,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2385,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2386,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2387,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
2388,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
2389,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2390,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
2391,i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
2392,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
2393,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the first movie,2
2394,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
2395,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
2396,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
2397,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2398,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2399,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2400,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
2401,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
2402,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
2403,this movie did a great job with him,2
2404,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2405,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
2406,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2407,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
2408,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
2409,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
2410,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
2411,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
2412,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2413,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers,2
2414,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2415,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
2416,overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
2417,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
2418,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
2419,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2420,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
2421,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
2422,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
2423,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
2424,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2425,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
2426,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
2427,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
2428,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
2429,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
2430,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2431,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
2432,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
2433,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2434,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
2435,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2436,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2437,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2438,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
2439,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2440,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
2441,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2442,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2443,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2444,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
2445,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
2446,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
2447,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2448,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
2449,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
2450,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
2451,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2452,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
2453,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
2454,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
2455,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2456,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
2457,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2458,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2459,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
2460,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2461,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
2462,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
2463,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2464,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
2465,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2466,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
2467,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2468,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
2469,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
2470,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
2471,the avengers age of ultron is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
2472,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2473,it tries hard to live up to the name of the mcu,2
2474,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
2475,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
2476,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2477,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2478,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2479,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
2480,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
2481,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2482,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2483,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
2484,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
2485,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
2486,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2487,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
2488,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2489,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
2490,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2491,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
2492,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2493,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2494,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
2495,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
2496,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think ant-man will,2
2497,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2498,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
2499,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2500,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
2501,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2502,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2503,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2504,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2505,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2506,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2507,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
2508,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
2509,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
2510,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
2511,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2512,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2513,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
2514,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2515,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
2516,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
2517,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
2518,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
2519,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
2520,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
2521,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2522,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2523,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
2524,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's as well as michael peã±a's innocent-faced humor,2
2525,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2526,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
2527,not nearly as good as the 1st one,2
2528,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
2529,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2530,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2531,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2532,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2533,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2534,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
2535,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2536,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
2537,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2538,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2539,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
2540,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
2541,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2542,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
2543,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2544,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
2545,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2546,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2547,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
2548,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2549,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2550,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2551,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
2552,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
2553,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2554,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
2555,but other than that the rest of the marvel universe where the hell was the ant-man and the wasp,2
2556,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
2557,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
2558,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2559,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
2560,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
2561,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
2562,there were other problems too but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
2563,well it wasn't so good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
2564,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2565,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2566,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
2567,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2568,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2569,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
2570,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
2571,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
2572,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
2573,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2574,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2575,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
2576,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
2577,there were other problems too but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
2578,it tries hard to live up to the name of the mcu,2
2579,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
2580,i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
2581,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
2582,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2583,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
2584,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2585,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
2586,when it was released the first ant-man is not a big success,2
2587,though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
2588,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2589,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
2590,plus i really don't know what's going on in the movie,2
2591,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
2592,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2593,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
2594,the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2595,there were other problems too but i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
2596,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
2597,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2598,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
2599,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
2600,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
2601,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
2602,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
2603,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2604,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2605,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
2606,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
2607,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2608,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
2609,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
2610,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2611,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
2612,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
2613,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
2614,and i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
2615,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2616,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2617,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
2618,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2619,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2620,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2621,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
2622,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2623,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2624,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
2625,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2626,rhodes character and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
2627,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
2628,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2629,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2630,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
2631,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
2632,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2633,it's not that it's a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
2634,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
2635,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2636,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
2637,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2638,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2639,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
2640,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2641,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
2642,just not quite as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
2643,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2644,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
2645,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2646,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
2647,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst films of all time,2
2648,to me this is the worst film of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
2649,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
2650,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
2651,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
2652,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
2653,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
2654,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
2655,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2656,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
2657,the action isn't nearly as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2658,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2659,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2660,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2661,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
2662,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
2663,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
2664,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2665,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
2666,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
2667,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2668,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
2669,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2670,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if that's saying much,2
2671,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2672,when it was released the first ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
2673,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
2674,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
2675,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
2676,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2677,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
2678,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2679,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
2680,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
2681,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
2682,iron man 2 is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2683,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2684,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
2685,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
2686,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
2687,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
2688,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2689,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp does little narratively and hardly explains any crucial plot points,2
2690,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
2691,the raccoon was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
2692,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
2693,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2694,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2695,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2696,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
2697,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
2698,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2699,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2700,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2701,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
2702,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
2703,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
2704,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2705,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2706,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2707,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2708,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
2709,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2710,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
2711,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
2712,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2713,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2714,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2715,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
2716,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the news,2
2717,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2718,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2719,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2720,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2721,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
2722,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2723,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
2724,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
2725,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2726,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2727,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
2728,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
2729,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
2730,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
2731,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2732,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2733,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
2734,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2735,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
2736,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2737,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
2738,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
2739,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
2740,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2741,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2742,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2743,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
2744,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2745,and i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
2746,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2747,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
2748,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
2749,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
2750,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
2751,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
2752,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
2753,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2754,s clearly not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2755,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2756,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
2757,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
2758,the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
2759,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
2760,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2761,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2762,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2763,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
2764,we have what i consider to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2765,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
2766,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2767,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
2768,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2769,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
2770,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
2771,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know,2
2772,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
2773,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
2774,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2775,i'd give avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
2776,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
2777,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2778,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
2779,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
2780,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like this one very much,2
2781,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2782,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
2783,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2784,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
2785,this movie did a great job with him,2
2786,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2787,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2788,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2789,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
2790,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
2791,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2792,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
2793,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
2794,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
2795,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
2796,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2797,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
2798,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
2799,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
2800,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
2801,there were other problems too but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
2802,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
2803,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2804,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
2805,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2806,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
2807,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
2808,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
2809,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2810,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2811,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2812,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2813,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2814,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
2815,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
2816,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2817,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2818,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
2819,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
2820,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
2821,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
2822,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
2823,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2824,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
2825,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2826,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2827,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
2828,the best thing about this film is it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
2829,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
2830,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2831,the movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part it was a good movie,2
2832,age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
2833,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
2834,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2835,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2836,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
2837,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
2838,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2839,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
2840,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2841,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
2842,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
2843,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2844,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
2845,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2846,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2847,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
2848,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
2849,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
2850,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
2851,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2852,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
2853,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2854,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2855,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
2856,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2857,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
2858,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2859,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
2860,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
2861,it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2862,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
2863,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2864,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
2865,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
2866,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2867,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
2868,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2869,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
2870,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
2871,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
2872,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
2873,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
2874,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
2875,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
2876,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
2877,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
2878,one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
2879,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
2880,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2881,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
2882,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
2883,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
2884,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2885,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2886,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
2887,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2888,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
2889,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
2890,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
2891,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
2892,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2893,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2894,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
2895,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
2896,i thought this movie was a mess and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2897,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
2898,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
2899,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
2900,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
2901,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
2902,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
2903,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
2904,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2905,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2906,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
2907,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2908,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2909,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
2910,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2911,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2912,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2913,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2914,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2915,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
2916,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
2917,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
2918,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
2919,in the end ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
2920,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
2921,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2922,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
2923,that's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
2924,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2925,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2926,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2927,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
2928,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2929,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
2930,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2931,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
2932,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
2933,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
2934,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
2935,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
2936,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2937,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2938,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
2939,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
2940,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2941,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2942,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
2943,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2944,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
2945,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
2946,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
2947,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
2948,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
2949,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2950,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2951,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2952,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
2953,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2954,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
2955,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
2956,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2957,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
2958,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
2959,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2960,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
2961,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2962,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
2963,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
2964,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2965,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2966,it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
2967,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
2968,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2969,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy it is the sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy vol,2
2970,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2971,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
2972,i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
2973,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2974,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2975,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
2976,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
2977,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
2978,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
2979,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
2980,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2981,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2982,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
2983,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
2984,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
2985,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
2986,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2987,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
2988,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2989,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2990,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
2991,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
2992,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
2993,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
2994,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
2995,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
2996,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
2997,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2998,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
2999,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
3000,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
3001,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
3002,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3003,mainly because this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
3004,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3005,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3006,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
3007,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
3008,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
3009,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
3010,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3011,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
3012,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
3013,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
3014,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
3015,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
3016,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3017,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3018,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
3019,and i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
3020,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
3021,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
3022,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3023,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3024,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3025,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
3026,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
3027,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
3028,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
3029,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
3030,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
3031,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
3032,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
3033,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3034,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3035,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
3036,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
3037,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
3038,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3039,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
3040,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
3041,i thought that this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
3042,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3043,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
3044,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3045,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
3046,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
3047,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3048,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3049,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
3050,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
3051,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3052,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
3053,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
3054,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3055,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3056,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
3057,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3058,the action is supposed to be like that,2
3059,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
3060,really didn't like this one very much,2
3061,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3062,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
3063,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3064,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
3065,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
3066,scenes from trailer are also one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
3067,we have what i consider to be one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
3068,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3069,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
3070,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3071,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
3072,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
3073,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3074,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3075,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
3076,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
3077,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
3078,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
3079,rhodes character and is one of the worst characters ever made,2
3080,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3081,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
3082,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3083,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
3084,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
3085,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3086,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3087,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
3088,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3089,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
3090,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3091,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
3092,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3093,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
3094,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
3095,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3096,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3097,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3098,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
3099,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
3100,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
3101,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3102,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
3103,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3104,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3105,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3106,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
3107,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3108,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
3109,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3110,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
3111,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3112,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3113,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
3114,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3115,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3116,plus it wasn't even as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
3117,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
3118,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know,2
3119,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3120,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3121,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
3122,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
3123,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3124,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
3125,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3126,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3127,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3128,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3129,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
3130,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
3131,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3132,but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie confirms it,2
3133,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3134,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3135,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3136,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
3137,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3138,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
3139,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
3140,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3141,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3142,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
3143,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3144,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3145,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3146,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3147,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
3148,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
3149,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
3150,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
3151,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3152,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3153,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
3154,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
3155,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3156,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
3157,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3158,this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
3159,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like this one,2
3160,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
3161,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
3162,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3163,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
3164,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3165,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3166,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
3167,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
3168,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3169,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3170,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3171,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
3172,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3173,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3174,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
3175,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
3176,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
3177,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
3178,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
3179,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
3180,the action is supposed to be like that,2
3181,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3182,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
3183,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
3184,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
3185,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
3186,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3187,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
3188,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
3189,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
3190,did not live up to hype and fame,2
3191,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3192,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
3193,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3194,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3195,the only part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
3196,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
3197,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
3198,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
3199,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the hype,2
3200,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3201,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3202,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3203,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3204,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
3205,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
3206,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
3207,one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
3208,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
3209,but this movie does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
3210,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3211,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3212,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3213,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
3214,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
3215,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3216,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3217,the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3218,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
3219,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
3220,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3221,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
3222,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3223,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3224,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
3225,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
3226,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3227,it has some fun moments but for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
3228,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3229,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
3230,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3231,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3232,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
3233,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
3234,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
3235,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
3236,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3237,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3238,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
3239,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
3240,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3241,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3242,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
3243,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
3244,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3245,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
3246,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
3247,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3248,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
3249,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3250,more worryingly it has a lot of jokes and for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3251,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3252,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
3253,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
3254,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
3255,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
3256,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
3257,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
3258,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3259,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think there was a good movie,2
3260,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3261,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3262,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3263,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3264,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3265,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
3266,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
3267,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
3268,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3269,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why the action in this movie,2
3270,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
3271,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3272,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3273,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3274,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
3275,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
3276,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
3277,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
3278,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3279,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like it,2
3280,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3281,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
3282,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3283,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3284,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3285,no just no i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
3286,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
3287,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3288,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3289,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3290,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
3291,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
3292,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
3293,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3294,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3295,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3296,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
3297,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
3298,not nearly as good as the first one,2
3299,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
3300,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3301,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
3302,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
3303,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
3304,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3305,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3306,this movie did a great job with him,2
3307,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
3308,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
3309,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
3310,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3311,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3312,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
3313,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
3314,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
3315,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3316,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
3317,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
3318,although it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3319,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3320,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
3321,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3322,really didn't like this one very much,2
3323,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
3324,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3325,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3326,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
3327,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
3328,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
3329,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3330,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
3331,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
3332,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3333,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
3334,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
3335,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
3336,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3337,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
3338,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
3339,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
3340,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3341,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3342,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
3343,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
3344,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
3345,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3346,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
3347,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3348,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3349,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
3350,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film had been like this,2
3351,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
3352,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3353,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
3354,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
3355,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
3356,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
3357,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3358,to me this is the worst film of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
3359,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
3360,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
3361,it tries hard to live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
3362,i'd give avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
3363,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
3364,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
3365,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3366,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
3367,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
3368,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
3369,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
3370,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
3371,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3372,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3373,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
3374,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
3375,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3376,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
3377,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
3378,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
3379,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
3380,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
3381,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
3382,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3383,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3384,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3385,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3386,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
3387,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3388,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
3389,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
3390,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3391,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
3392,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
3393,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
3394,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
3395,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3396,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3397,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3398,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3399,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3400,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
3401,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
3402,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
3403,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
3404,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3405,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3406,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
3407,rooker was the best part of the film is its contrived humor,2
3408,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3409,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3410,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3411,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
3412,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
3413,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3414,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
3415,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3416,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
3417,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3418,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
3419,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
3420,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
3421,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
3422,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
3423,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
3424,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
3425,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
3426,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
3427,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
3428,it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3429,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
3430,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
3431,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3432,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
3433,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3434,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3435,look it's not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
3436,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3437,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
3438,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3439,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3440,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3441,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
3442,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
3443,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
3444,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3445,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers,2
3446,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
3447,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3448,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3449,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
3450,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
3451,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
3452,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
3453,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3454,to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
3455,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3456,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3457,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3458,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
3459,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
3460,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
3461,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
3462,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
3463,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
3464,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3465,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
3466,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
3467,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3468,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
3469,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
3470,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
3471,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
3472,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
3473,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
3474,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3475,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3476,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
3477,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
3478,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3479,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3480,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
3481,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3482,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3483,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3484,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
3485,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
3486,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3487,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
3488,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3489,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3490,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
3491,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
3492,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
3493,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
3494,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
3495,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3496,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
3497,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3498,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3499,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
3500,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3501,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
3502,not one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
3503,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
3504,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3505,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
3506,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
3507,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
3508,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
3509,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
3510,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3511,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3512,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3513,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst films of all time,2
3514,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
3515,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
3516,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
3517,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
3518,again it's not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3519,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
3520,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
3521,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
3522,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3523,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
3524,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
3525,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3526,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
3527,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3528,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3529,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
3530,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
3531,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
3532,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
3533,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3534,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
3535,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3536,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3537,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
3538,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
3539,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3540,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
3541,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3542,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
3543,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3544,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
3545,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
3546,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3547,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
3548,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3549,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3550,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3551,for the most part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
3552,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
3553,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3554,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3555,not one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
3556,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3557,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
3558,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
3559,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3560,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
3561,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
3562,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
3563,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
3564,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
3565,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
3566,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
3567,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
3568,i don't know why i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
3569,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3570,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3571,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
3572,overall the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
3573,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
3574,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
3575,really didn't like this one very much,2
3576,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
3577,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
3578,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
3579,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3580,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3581,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
3582,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
3583,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
3584,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3585,improves over iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
3586,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
3587,the raccoon was the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
3588,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3589,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3590,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
3591,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
3592,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
3593,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
3594,i don't know what's going on,2
3595,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3596,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
3597,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3598,interesting speech at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
3599,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
3600,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3601,the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
3602,and also i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
3603,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
3604,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3605,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3606,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
3607,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3608,at this point i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
3609,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
3610,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
3611,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
3612,it's not as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
3613,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
3614,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
3615,i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
3616,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
3617,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
3618,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3619,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3620,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
3621,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
3622,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3623,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
3624,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
3625,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
3626,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
3627,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
3628,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3629,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3630,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
3631,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
3632,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
3633,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
3634,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
3635,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3636,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3637,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
3638,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
3639,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3640,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3641,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
3642,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
3643,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3644,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
3645,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3646,it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3647,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3648,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3649,rhodes character and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
3650,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
3651,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
3652,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3653,i don't know what's going on in the movie,2
3654,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3655,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
3656,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
3657,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst characters ever made,2
3658,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3659,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
3660,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
3661,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man,2
3662,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3663,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3664,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
3665,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
3666,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3667,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
3668,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
3669,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
3670,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
3671,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie is 2,2
3672,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
3673,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3674,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
3675,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
3676,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
3677,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3678,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
3679,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
3680,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3681,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
3682,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3683,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3684,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
3685,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
3686,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
3687,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
3688,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3689,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3690,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
3691,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
3692,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
3693,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3694,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3695,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3696,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
3697,and the sad part is that i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
3698,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3699,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
3700,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
3701,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3702,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3703,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3704,unlike the first one iron man 2 is one of the most average movies there is,2
3705,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3706,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
3707,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
3708,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3709,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
3710,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3711,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst,2
3712,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as good as i remembered,2
3713,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
3714,the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
3715,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
3716,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3717,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
3718,mainly because this movie does not live up to the original,2
3719,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3720,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
3721,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
3722,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3723,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
3724,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3725,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3726,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
3727,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
3728,mainly because this movie does not live up to the original,2
3729,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3730,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
3731,there were other problems too but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
3732,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
3733,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if that's saying much,2
3734,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
3735,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3736,really didn't like this one very much,2
3737,this movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3738,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
3739,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3740,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
3741,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
3742,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
3743,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3744,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
3745,guardians 2 does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
3746,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
3747,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3748,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
3749,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3750,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3751,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
3752,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3753,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
3754,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
3755,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
3756,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
3757,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
3758,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
3759,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
3760,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3761,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
3762,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3763,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
3764,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
3765,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like and found it overrated,2
3766,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
3767,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3768,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
3769,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
3770,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
3771,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3772,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
3773,mainly because this movie does not live up to hype,2
3774,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
3775,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3776,i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
3777,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
3778,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3779,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3780,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3781,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3782,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
3783,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
3784,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
3785,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
3786,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
3787,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3788,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
3789,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
3790,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3791,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
3792,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
3793,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3794,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
3795,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3796,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
3797,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3798,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
3799,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
3800,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3801,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3802,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
3803,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
3804,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3805,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3806,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
3807,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3808,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
3809,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3810,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
3811,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
3812,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
3813,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3814,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
3815,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
3816,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
3817,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3818,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
3819,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3820,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3821,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
3822,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
3823,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3824,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3825,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3826,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3827,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
3828,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3829,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
3830,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
3831,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
3832,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
3833,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3834,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
3835,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
3836,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
3837,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
3838,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3839,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
3840,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
3841,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
3842,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3843,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
3844,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
3845,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
3846,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3847,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
3848,the raccoon was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3849,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3850,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3851,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
3852,really didn't like this one very much,2
3853,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
3854,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3855,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
3856,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3857,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3858,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
3859,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
3860,we have what i consider to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
3861,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
3862,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3863,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3864,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3865,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3866,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
3867,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3868,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3869,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
3870,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
3871,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
3872,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3873,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3874,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
3875,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
3876,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
3877,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
3878,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
3879,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3880,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3881,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
3882,really didn't like this one very much,2
3883,rooker was the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
3884,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
3885,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
3886,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3887,rocket raccoon i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
3888,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3889,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
3890,but other than that the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3891,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3892,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
3893,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3894,not nearly as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
3895,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3896,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3897,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
3898,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
3899,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3900,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
3901,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3902,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
3903,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
3904,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst characters ever made,2
3905,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
3906,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
3907,this movie did a great job with him,2
3908,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
3909,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3910,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
3911,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
3912,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
3913,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
3914,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3915,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
3916,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
3917,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3918,plus it wasn't even as good as the 1st one,2
3919,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
3920,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3921,a big step down from the first movie and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
3922,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3923,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
3924,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
3925,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
3926,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
3927,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
3928,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
3929,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3930,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3931,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3932,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
3933,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
3934,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
3935,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
3936,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
3937,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
3938,i'd say it was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
3939,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3940,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3941,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3942,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3943,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
3944,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been better,2
3945,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
3946,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
3947,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3948,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3949,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
3950,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
3951,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
3952,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man film,2
3953,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3954,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3955,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
3956,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
3957,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
3958,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
3959,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
3960,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3961,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3962,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
3963,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
3964,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
3965,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
3966,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3967,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
3968,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
3969,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
3970,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
3971,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3972,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
3973,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3974,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3975,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
3976,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
3977,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3978,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3979,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
3980,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3981,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
3982,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
3983,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
3984,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
3985,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3986,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3987,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
3988,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
3989,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
3990,and the sad part is that i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
3991,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3992,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
3993,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3994,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
3995,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
3996,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3997,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
3998,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
3999,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4000,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
4001,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4002,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
4003,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
4004,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
4005,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4006,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4007,i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
4008,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4009,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
4010,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
4011,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
4012,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
4013,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4014,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
4015,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4016,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
4017,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4018,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
4019,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4020,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
4021,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4022,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4023,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4024,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
4025,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4026,but at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
4027,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
4028,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
4029,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
4030,despite the fact that i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4031,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
4032,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
4033,why do all the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie,2
4034,it's not as good as the first,2
4035,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
4036,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
4037,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
4038,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4039,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4040,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
4041,although it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4042,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
4043,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4044,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
4045,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4046,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4047,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4048,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
4049,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
4050,the action is supposed to be like that,2
4051,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
4052,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
4053,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
4054,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
4055,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4056,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
4057,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
4058,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4059,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4060,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4061,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
4062,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4063,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
4064,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
4065,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4066,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
4067,in the end ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
4068,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4069,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4070,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
4071,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
4072,honestly the colours in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
4073,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
4074,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
4075,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4076,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4077,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4078,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
4079,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
4080,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
4081,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4082,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
4083,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
4084,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4085,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
4086,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
4087,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
4088,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4089,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4090,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4091,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
4092,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
4093,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
4094,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4095,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
4096,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
4097,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
4098,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
4099,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
4100,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
4101,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
4102,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4103,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
4104,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
4105,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
4106,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
4107,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
4108,really didn't like this one very much,2
4109,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4110,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
4111,after the events of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
4112,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4113,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 especially with its satirizing nods to the dark knight rises,2
4114,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
4115,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
4116,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
4117,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
4118,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
4119,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4120,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4121,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
4122,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
4123,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4124,i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
4125,age of ultron is one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
4126,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
4127,this movie was a mess and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
4128,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4129,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
4130,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
4131,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4132,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
4133,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
4134,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
4135,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
4136,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
4137,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
4138,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
4139,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
4140,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
4141,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
4142,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
4143,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4144,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4145,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4146,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the many mediocre ones,2
4147,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
4148,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
4149,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
4150,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4151,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
4152,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
4153,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
4154,i actually liked the first ant-man did,2
4155,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4156,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
4157,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
4158,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
4159,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4160,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4161,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
4162,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4163,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
4164,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
4165,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
4166,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
4167,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
4168,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4169,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
4170,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
4171,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
4172,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
4173,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4174,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
4175,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
4176,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
4177,other than that the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4178,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
4179,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
4180,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
4181,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
4182,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
4183,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
4184,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
4185,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
4186,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the 1st one,2
4187,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
4188,this is one of the worst films of all time but it's just a setup for the avengers,2
4189,how the heck are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
4190,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4191,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
4192,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4193,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
4194,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4195,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4196,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4197,the film itself feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
4198,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
4199,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4200,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4201,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4202,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
4203,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
4204,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
4205,i don't know why i think he's one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
4206,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4207,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
4208,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4209,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
4210,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4211,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
4212,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4213,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
4214,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
4215,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
4216,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4217,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
4218,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
4219,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4220,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4221,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
4222,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
4223,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
4224,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
4225,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
4226,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
4227,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
4228,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
4229,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4230,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
4231,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
4232,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
4233,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
4234,mainly because this movie does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4235,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4236,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
4237,not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
4238,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4239,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
4240,it met my expectations in that it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
4241,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4242,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
4243,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4244,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
4245,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4246,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4247,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
4248,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
4249,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
4250,it tries hard to live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
4251,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
4252,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
4253,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
4254,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
4255,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4256,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4257,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
4258,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
4259,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4260,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
4261,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
4262,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
4263,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4264,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4265,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
4266,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4267,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
4268,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
4269,ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4270,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
4271,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
4272,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4273,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
4274,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4275,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
4276,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
4277,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4278,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4279,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
4280,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4281,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
4282,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
4283,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
4284,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4285,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
4286,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4287,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
4288,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4289,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
4290,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
4291,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
4292,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4293,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
4294,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4295,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4296,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4297,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
4298,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
4299,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
4300,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
4301,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
4302,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
4303,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4304,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4305,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4306,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4307,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
4308,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
4309,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
4310,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
4311,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4312,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4313,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man,2
4314,we have what i consider to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
4315,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4316,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
4317,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
4318,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
4319,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4320,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4321,its giving tony stark layers while bridging the gap between the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
4322,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
4323,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4324,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4325,instead it feels like a parody of the genre,2
4326,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4327,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
4328,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
4329,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4330,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
4331,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4332,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
4333,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4334,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
4335,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
4336,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4337,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
4338,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4339,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
4340,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4341,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4342,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4343,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4344,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4345,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
4346,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4347,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
4348,we have what i consider to be one of the worst characters ever made,2
4349,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
4350,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4351,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4352,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4353,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
4354,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4355,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4356,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4357,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
4358,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
4359,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4360,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
4361,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
4362,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
4363,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4364,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
4365,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
4366,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4367,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4368,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
4369,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4370,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4371,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
4372,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
4373,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
4374,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
4375,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
4376,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4377,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4378,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4379,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4380,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4381,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
4382,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4383,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4384,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4385,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4386,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
4387,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
4388,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4389,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
4390,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
4391,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4392,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4393,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4394,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4395,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
4396,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4397,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
4398,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4399,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
4400,a big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
4401,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
4402,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4403,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
4404,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
4405,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
4406,and the sad part is that i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
4407,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4408,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
4409,really didn't like this one very much,2
4410,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4411,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
4412,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
4413,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
4414,also one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
4415,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
4416,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4417,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4418,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4419,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4420,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
4421,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4422,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
4423,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4424,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4425,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy,2
4426,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
4427,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
4428,but other than that the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
4429,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
4430,it feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
4431,better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4432,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
4433,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4434,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4435,iron man 3 was an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
4436,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
4437,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
4438,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
4439,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4440,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4441,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4442,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4443,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
4444,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4445,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
4446,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
4447,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4448,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
4449,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
4450,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
4451,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
4452,you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4453,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4454,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
4455,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
4456,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4457,i felt iron man 2 is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
4458,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
4459,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
4460,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
4461,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4462,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4463,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4464,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
4465,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4466,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
4467,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
4468,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
4469,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
4470,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4471,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
4472,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
4473,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
4474,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
4475,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
4476,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
4477,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
4478,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
4479,i'm not a fan of the source material and you can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
4480,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
4481,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4482,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
4483,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
4484,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
4485,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
4486,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4487,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
4488,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
4489,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
4490,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4491,it wasn't bad but not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4492,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4493,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
4494,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
4495,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
4496,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
4497,i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4498,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
4499,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
4500,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4501,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film is a mess,2
4502,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4503,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
4504,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4505,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4506,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
4507,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4508,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4509,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the film had been like this,2
4510,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
4511,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
4512,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4513,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4514,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4515,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
4516,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4517,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
4518,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4519,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4520,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
4521,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
4522,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4523,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
4524,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4525,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4526,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
4527,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4528,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
4529,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
4530,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4531,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
4532,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4533,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4534,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
4535,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
4536,rooker was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
4537,better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4538,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
4539,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
4540,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4541,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4542,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
4543,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
4544,and also i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
4545,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
4546,scenes from trailer are also one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
4547,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4548,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4549,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
4550,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4551,i felt iron man 2 is one of the worst characters ever made,2
4552,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4553,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4554,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
4555,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
4556,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
4557,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4558,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4559,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
4560,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
4561,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
4562,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
4563,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
4564,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
4565,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
4566,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
4567,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
4568,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
4569,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
4570,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4571,big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
4572,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
4573,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4574,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
4575,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4576,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4577,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4578,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4579,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4580,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
4581,although the material is tired it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
4582,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
4583,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4584,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
4585,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4586,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
4587,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4588,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
4589,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4590,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
4591,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
4592,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4593,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4594,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
4595,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4596,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4597,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
4598,i thought he was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
4599,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
4600,it's not as good as the first,2
4601,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
4602,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
4603,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4604,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
4605,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
4606,the raccoon was the best part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
4607,this movie did a great job with him,2
4608,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4609,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
4610,not nearly as good as the first one,2
4611,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4612,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
4613,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
4614,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
4615,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4616,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
4617,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
4618,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4619,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
4620,unlike the first one iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4621,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
4622,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4623,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4624,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4625,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
4626,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4627,and the sad part is that i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
4628,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
4629,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
4630,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4631,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4632,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4633,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4634,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4635,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
4636,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
4637,there were other problems too but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
4638,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4639,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
4640,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
4641,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4642,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
4643,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4644,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4645,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
4646,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
4647,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4648,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best ever,2
4649,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4650,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
4651,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
4652,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4653,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4654,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
4655,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
4656,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4657,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
4658,did not live up to hype and fame,2
4659,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
4660,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4661,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
4662,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
4663,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4664,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4665,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the mcu,2
4666,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
4667,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
4668,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
4669,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
4670,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
4671,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
4672,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
4673,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
4674,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4675,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4676,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
4677,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
4678,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
4679,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4680,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
4681,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
4682,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
4683,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4684,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
4685,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
4686,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
4687,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
4688,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
4689,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
4690,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp does little narratively and hardly explains any crucial plot points,2
4691,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
4692,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
4693,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
4694,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
4695,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
4696,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4697,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4698,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4699,i'd give avengers age of ultron is one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
4700,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
4701,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
4702,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
4703,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
4704,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
4705,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
4706,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man,2
4707,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
4708,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to hype and fame,2
4709,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
4710,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4711,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
4712,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
4713,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
4714,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
4715,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4716,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
4717,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
4718,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
4719,this movie did a great job with him,2
4720,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
4721,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4722,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
4723,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
4724,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4725,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4726,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
4727,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4728,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
4729,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
4730,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
4731,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4732,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4733,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
4734,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4735,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4736,and also i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
4737,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4738,it was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
4739,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
4740,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
4741,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
4742,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
4743,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4744,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
4745,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
4746,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
4747,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man film,2
4748,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
4749,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
4750,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
4751,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
4752,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
4753,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
4754,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4755,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
4756,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
4757,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
4758,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4759,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
4760,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
4761,it feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
4762,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
4763,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
4764,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4765,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4766,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
4767,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4768,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4769,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
4770,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
4771,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
4772,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
4773,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4774,one of the worst villains it was rushed and it was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the film,2
4775,this movie did a great job with him,2
4776,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
4777,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4778,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
4779,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4780,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4781,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
4782,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
4783,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
4784,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4785,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
4786,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
4787,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
4788,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
4789,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4790,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4791,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4792,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4793,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4794,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
4795,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
4796,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4797,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
4798,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
4799,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4800,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
4801,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4802,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4803,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4804,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4805,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
4806,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4807,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4808,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4809,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
4810,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
4811,no just no i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
4812,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
4813,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
4814,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
4815,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4816,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
4817,not nearly as good as the first one,2
4818,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
4819,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4820,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
4821,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4822,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
4823,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
4824,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
4825,it was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
4826,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
4827,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4828,did not live up to hype and fame,2
4829,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
4830,and i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
4831,iron man 2 is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
4832,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
4833,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
4834,one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
4835,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
4836,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
4837,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4838,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
4839,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
4840,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4841,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
4842,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
4843,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4844,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4845,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4846,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
4847,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
4848,we have what i consider to be one of the worst films of all time,2
4849,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man is not a big success,2
4850,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4851,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
4852,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4853,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
4854,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4855,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
4856,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4857,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4858,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
4859,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
4860,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4861,ant-man has got to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
4862,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
4863,this is my least favorite of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
4864,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4865,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4866,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4867,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4868,i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
4869,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
4870,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
4871,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4872,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
4873,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
4874,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
4875,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
4876,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4877,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
4878,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
4879,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
4880,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
4881,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4882,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
4883,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to hype,2
4884,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4885,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4886,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4887,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4888,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
4889,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
4890,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4891,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4892,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4893,unlike the first one iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
4894,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
4895,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4896,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4897,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
4898,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4899,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4900,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
4901,look it's not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
4902,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
4903,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4904,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4905,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4906,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4907,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4908,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
4909,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4910,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
4911,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4912,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
4913,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
4914,i think he's one of the most average movies there is,2
4915,it's like one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
4916,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4917,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
4918,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
4919,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
4920,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
4921,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4922,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4923,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4924,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
4925,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
4926,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4927,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4928,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4929,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
4930,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
4931,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
4932,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
4933,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4934,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
4935,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4936,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
4937,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp does little narratively and hardly explains any crucial plot points,2
4938,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4939,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
4940,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4941,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
4942,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
4943,one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
4944,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4945,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
4946,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4947,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
4948,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4949,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
4950,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4951,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
4952,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
4953,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
4954,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4955,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4956,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4957,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4958,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
4959,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why people love it so much,2
4960,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4961,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4962,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one very much,2
4963,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4964,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4965,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4966,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4967,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
4968,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4969,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4970,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4971,although the film is entertaining for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
4972,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
4973,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
4974,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4975,it was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
4976,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
4977,other than that the rest of the actors do fine,2
4978,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
4979,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
4980,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and plot to develop,2
4981,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4982,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4983,the avengers age of ultron is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
4984,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4985,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
4986,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
4987,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4988,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
4989,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
4990,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4991,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
4992,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
4993,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
4994,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
4995,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4996,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
4997,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4998,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4999,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5000,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5001,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5002,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
5003,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
5004,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
5005,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5006,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5007,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5008,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
5009,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5010,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5011,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
5012,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5013,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5014,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
5015,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5016,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5017,weakest out of all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
5018,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5019,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
5020,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5021,there are some funny moments but there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
5022,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
5023,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
5024,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
5025,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5026,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
5027,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
5028,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5029,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5030,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5031,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
5032,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
5033,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
5034,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5035,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
5036,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5037,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
5038,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5039,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
5040,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5041,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
5042,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
5043,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5044,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
5045,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
5046,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
5047,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
5048,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
5049,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
5050,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
5051,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
5052,rocket raccoon i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
5053,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
5054,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
5055,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
5056,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5057,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5058,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
5059,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
5060,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
5061,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5062,it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5063,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel characters,2
5064,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
5065,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5066,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
5067,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5068,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
5069,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
5070,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5071,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5072,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
5073,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
5074,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5075,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
5076,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5077,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5078,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
5079,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
5080,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
5081,plus i really don't know what's going to happen,2
5082,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
5083,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
5084,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
5085,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5086,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
5087,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
5088,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5089,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
5090,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5091,not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
5092,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5093,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
5094,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
5095,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
5096,the action isn't nearly as good as the first,2
5097,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5098,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
5099,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5100,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
5101,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
5102,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
5103,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5104,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5105,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
5106,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
5107,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5108,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
5109,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
5110,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
5111,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
5112,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5113,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5114,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
5115,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5116,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5117,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5118,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5119,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
5120,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5121,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5122,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
5123,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
5124,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5125,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
5126,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
5127,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
5128,the suit looked impressive and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
5129,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
5130,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
5131,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5132,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
5133,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5134,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
5135,to me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
5136,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp,2
5137,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5138,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5139,this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
5140,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5141,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
5142,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5143,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
5144,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
5145,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
5146,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5147,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5148,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
5149,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
5150,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5151,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5152,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5153,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
5154,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5155,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5156,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
5157,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
5158,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
5159,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5160,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5161,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5162,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5163,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
5164,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5165,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
5166,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5167,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
5168,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5169,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
5170,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5171,this movie did a great job with him,2
5172,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5173,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
5174,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
5175,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5176,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5177,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
5178,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
5179,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
5180,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
5181,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
5182,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
5183,it tries hard to live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5184,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5185,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
5186,one thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
5187,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
5188,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
5189,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
5190,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of manipulative but meaningless death in the last act,2
5191,this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
5192,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
5193,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
5194,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
5195,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5196,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5197,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
5198,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5199,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
5200,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
5201,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5202,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
5203,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5204,it's not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5205,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
5206,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5207,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5208,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5209,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
5210,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
5211,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
5212,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5213,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5214,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
5215,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5216,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5217,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
5218,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5219,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
5220,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5221,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5222,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
5223,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5224,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
5225,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
5226,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5227,luis was one of the best marvel movies,2
5228,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
5229,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5230,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
5231,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
5232,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5233,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
5234,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5235,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5236,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5237,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5238,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
5239,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
5240,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5241,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
5242,the action isn't nearly as good as the 1st one,2
5243,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5244,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
5245,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be better,2
5246,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
5247,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
5248,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
5249,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5250,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5251,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5252,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5253,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
5254,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5255,after the success of the first film which let's be honest,2
5256,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
5257,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
5258,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
5259,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5260,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
5261,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
5262,i really like the first ant-man is a fun film,2
5263,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5264,though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
5265,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
5266,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
5267,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
5268,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
5269,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5270,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
5271,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
5272,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
5273,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
5274,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
5275,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5276,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
5277,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5278,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
5279,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
5280,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5281,rhodes character and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5282,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5283,big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
5284,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as good as the first,2
5285,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
5286,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5287,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the genre,2
5288,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
5289,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5290,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
5291,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5292,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5293,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5294,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
5295,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
5296,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5297,iron man 2 is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5298,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5299,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
5300,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
5301,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
5302,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5303,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
5304,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5305,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
5306,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5307,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
5308,don't don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
5309,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
5310,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5311,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel characters,2
5312,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
5313,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5314,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5315,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
5316,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5317,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
5318,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
5319,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
5320,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
5321,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
5322,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5323,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5324,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
5325,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
5326,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
5327,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
5328,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
5329,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5330,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5331,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
5332,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
5333,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
5334,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
5335,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
5336,one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5337,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
5338,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5339,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5340,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5341,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5342,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5343,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5344,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5345,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
5346,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5347,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
5348,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
5349,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5350,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
5351,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
5352,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5353,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
5354,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5355,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
5356,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5357,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
5358,i'd say it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
5359,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5360,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
5361,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
5362,the least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
5363,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
5364,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
5365,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
5366,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5367,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
5368,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
5369,and i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
5370,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
5371,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5372,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
5373,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5374,there were other problems too but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5375,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5376,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5377,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5378,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
5379,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5380,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5381,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5382,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5383,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
5384,and also i don't think there was a good movie,2
5385,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
5386,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the film had been like this,2
5387,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5388,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
5389,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
5390,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5391,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5392,it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5393,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5394,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
5395,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
5396,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
5397,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5398,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
5399,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
5400,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
5401,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5402,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
5403,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5404,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
5405,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5406,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
5407,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
5408,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
5409,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5410,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
5411,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
5412,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
5413,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5414,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
5415,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5416,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
5417,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5418,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5419,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
5420,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5421,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
5422,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie pepper saves the day instead of iron man tony stark,2
5423,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
5424,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5425,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5426,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
5427,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5428,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
5429,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5430,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
5431,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
5432,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
5433,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
5434,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
5435,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know,2
5436,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
5437,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
5438,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
5439,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5440,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5441,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
5442,at this point i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5443,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
5444,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
5445,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
5446,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5447,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5448,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
5449,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
5450,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best ever,2
5451,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5452,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5453,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
5454,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5455,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
5456,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5457,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5458,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5459,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5460,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5461,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
5462,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
5463,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5464,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5465,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5466,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
5467,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5468,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
5469,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5470,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5471,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
5472,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5473,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
5474,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
5475,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5476,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
5477,iron man on screen for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
5478,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
5479,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the movie,2
5480,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
5481,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
5482,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
5483,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5484,it's not as good as the first movie,2
5485,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5486,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
5487,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5488,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5489,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5490,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
5491,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
5492,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5493,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
5494,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
5495,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
5496,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
5497,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
5498,an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5499,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
5500,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
5501,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5502,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
5503,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
5504,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
5505,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5506,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5507,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5508,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
5509,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5510,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
5511,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
5512,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5513,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
5514,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
5515,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
5516,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
5517,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5518,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
5519,avengers age of ultron is one of the good things that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
5520,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
5521,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5522,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
5523,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
5524,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5525,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
5526,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
5527,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5528,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
5529,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5530,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
5531,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
5532,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5533,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
5534,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
5535,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
5536,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
5537,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
5538,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
5539,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
5540,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5541,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
5542,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5543,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
5544,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
5545,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
5546,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5547,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
5548,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5549,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5550,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5551,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
5552,the raccoon was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
5553,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5554,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5555,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5556,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
5557,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5558,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was made for kids,2
5559,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
5560,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5561,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
5562,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
5563,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
5564,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5565,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5566,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
5567,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
5568,it's the fact that i don't think ant-man will,2
5569,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5570,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
5571,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
5572,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5573,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
5574,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5575,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
5576,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5577,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5578,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
5579,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
5580,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5581,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
5582,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
5583,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
5584,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job,2
5585,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
5586,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5587,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
5588,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
5589,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5590,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5591,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
5592,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
5593,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
5594,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
5595,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know what's going on in the next avengers,2
5596,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
5597,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5598,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
5599,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5600,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5601,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5602,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
5603,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
5604,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
5605,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
5606,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
5607,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
5608,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
5609,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
5610,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
5611,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
5612,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5613,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
5614,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5615,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5616,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
5617,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
5618,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5619,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5620,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
5621,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
5622,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5623,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
5624,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5625,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know why the action in this movie,2
5626,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
5627,really didn't like this one very much,2
5628,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like this one very much,2
5629,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the different types of tony stark we got in the film,2
5630,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
5631,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
5632,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
5633,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5634,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
5635,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
5636,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
5637,not nearly as good as the first one,2
5638,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5639,the raccoon was the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
5640,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
5641,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
5642,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
5643,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
5644,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
5645,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5646,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
5647,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5648,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
5649,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
5650,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5651,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5652,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
5653,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
5654,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
5655,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5656,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
5657,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5658,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
5659,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
5660,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
5661,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5662,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
5663,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
5664,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5665,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
5666,it's like one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
5667,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
5668,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5669,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5670,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
5671,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
5672,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think ant-man will,2
5673,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5674,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first,2
5675,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
5676,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie,2
5677,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5678,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
5679,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
5680,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5681,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
5682,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
5683,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
5684,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
5685,hope this is the last of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
5686,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5687,i'd say it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
5688,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5689,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
5690,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
5691,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5692,the visual and cultural aspects are solid but outshined by guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
5693,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5694,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5695,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5696,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
5697,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5698,the action isn't nearly as good as the first movie,2
5699,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
5700,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5701,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
5702,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5703,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5704,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
5705,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
5706,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5707,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
5708,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
5709,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5710,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
5711,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
5712,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
5713,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
5714,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
5715,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
5716,it tries hard to live up to the hype in anyway,2
5717,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
5718,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5719,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5720,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
5721,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
5722,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
5723,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5724,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5725,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
5726,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5727,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5728,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
5729,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5730,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
5731,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5732,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
5733,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5734,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5735,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5736,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
5737,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5738,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5739,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5740,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
5741,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
5742,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
5743,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
5744,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
5745,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
5746,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5747,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5748,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
5749,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
5750,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
5751,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
5752,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
5753,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
5754,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
5755,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
5756,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
5757,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
5758,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5759,plus i really don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
5760,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5761,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5762,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5763,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
5764,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5765,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5766,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
5767,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5768,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
5769,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
5770,i felt iron man 2 is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5771,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
5772,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5773,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
5774,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
5775,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
5776,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
5777,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
5778,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5779,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5780,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
5781,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
5782,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5783,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5784,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5785,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
5786,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5787,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5788,the best thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
5789,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
5790,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5791,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
5792,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
5793,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
5794,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
5795,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5796,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
5797,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5798,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
5799,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
5800,while the action and visuals are great and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
5801,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
5802,the horrifically disrespectful treatment of the source material and you can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
5803,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5804,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
5805,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
5806,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
5807,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
5808,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5809,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5810,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
5811,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
5812,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5813,and the sad part is that i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5814,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5815,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5816,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5817,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5818,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5819,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5820,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
5821,iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
5822,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
5823,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
5824,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
5825,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
5826,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
5827,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5828,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
5829,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
5830,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
5831,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
5832,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5833,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
5834,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
5835,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
5836,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
5837,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
5838,this film had it's moments but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
5839,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
5840,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
5841,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5842,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5843,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5844,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
5845,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5846,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5847,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
5848,it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
5849,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
5850,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5851,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5852,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
5853,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5854,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
5855,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy 2,2
5856,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
5857,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5858,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
5859,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
5860,while not terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
5861,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5862,plus it wasn't even as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
5863,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
5864,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5865,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5866,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
5867,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
5868,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
5869,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
5870,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
5871,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
5872,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
5873,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
5874,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
5875,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5876,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's as well as michael peã±a's innocent-faced humor,2
5877,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
5878,while not terrible iron man 2 is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5879,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5880,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
5881,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
5882,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5883,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5884,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5885,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
5886,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
5887,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5888,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
5889,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
5890,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
5891,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5892,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5893,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
5894,just not quite as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5895,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
5896,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5897,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5898,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
5899,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5900,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
5901,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
5902,luis was one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
5903,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
5904,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
5905,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
5906,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5907,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
5908,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
5909,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
5910,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5911,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5912,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
5913,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5914,this movie was a mess and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
5915,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of the first ant-man,2
5916,other than that the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
5917,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5918,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5919,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
5920,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
5921,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
5922,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
5923,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
5924,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
5925,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
5926,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5927,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5928,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
5929,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5930,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5931,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5932,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5933,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
5934,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5935,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5936,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
5937,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
5938,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
5939,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5940,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
5941,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
5942,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
5943,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if that's saying much,2
5944,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
5945,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
5946,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5947,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
5948,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5949,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5950,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
5951,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
5952,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
5953,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5954,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
5955,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5956,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5957,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
5958,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
5959,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film had been like this,2
5960,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
5961,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5962,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
5963,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5964,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5965,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
5966,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
5967,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5968,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5969,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
5970,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think ant-man will,2
5971,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5972,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
5973,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
5974,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
5975,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5976,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
5977,we have what i consider to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5978,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5979,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
5980,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5981,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
5982,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
5983,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
5984,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5985,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
5986,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5987,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5988,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5989,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
5990,did not live up to hype and fame,2
5991,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
5992,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
5993,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
5994,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5995,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5996,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5997,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
5998,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
5999,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
6000,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
6001,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
6002,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
6003,iron man 2 is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
6004,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
6005,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6006,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
6007,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6008,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6009,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6010,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
6011,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
6012,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
6013,this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6014,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6015,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6016,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
6017,this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
6018,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
6019,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
6020,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
6021,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
6022,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
6023,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
6024,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
6025,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
6026,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6027,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6028,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
6029,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6030,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6031,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6032,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
6033,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
6034,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
6035,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
6036,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6037,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
6038,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
6039,not nearly as good as the 1st one,2
6040,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6041,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
6042,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6043,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6044,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6045,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6046,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
6047,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6048,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
6049,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
6050,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
6051,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6052,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6053,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6054,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
6055,how the heck are the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6056,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was awesome,2
6057,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6058,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
6059,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
6060,for the most part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
6061,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6062,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
6063,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6064,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
6065,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
6066,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6067,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
6068,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
6069,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6070,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
6071,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
6072,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
6073,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6074,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
6075,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
6076,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6077,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
6078,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
6079,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
6080,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6081,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
6082,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6083,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
6084,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6085,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6086,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6087,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6088,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
6089,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6090,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
6091,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
6092,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6093,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6094,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
6095,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6096,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6097,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
6098,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
6099,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6100,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6101,the movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
6102,it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6103,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6104,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6105,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6106,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6107,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6108,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6109,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6110,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
6111,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6112,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6113,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
6114,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6115,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6116,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
6117,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6118,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
6119,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
6120,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
6121,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
6122,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
6123,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel movie,2
6124,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6125,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
6126,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6127,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
6128,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6129,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
6130,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
6131,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6132,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6133,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6134,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
6135,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6136,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6137,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
6138,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
6139,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
6140,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
6141,it's the fact that i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
6142,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
6143,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
6144,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
6145,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
6146,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6147,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6148,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6149,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
6150,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
6151,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
6152,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6153,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
6154,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
6155,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
6156,also one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
6157,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
6158,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
6159,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
6160,its giving tony stark layers while bridging the gap between the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
6161,and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6162,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
6163,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
6164,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
6165,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6166,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
6167,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6168,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
6169,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
6170,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
6171,again it's not one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6172,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
6173,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6174,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6175,did not live up to hype and fame,2
6176,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
6177,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
6178,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
6179,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
6180,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6181,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6182,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
6183,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
6184,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
6185,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
6186,don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
6187,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6188,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6189,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6190,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6191,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
6192,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
6193,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
6194,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst films of all time but it's just a setup for the avengers,2
6195,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6196,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6197,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
6198,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6199,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
6200,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
6201,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
6202,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6203,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
6204,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6205,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6206,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
6207,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6208,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6209,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
6210,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6211,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6212,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
6213,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
6214,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
6215,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
6216,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
6217,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
6218,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6219,i really don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
6220,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6221,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6222,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
6223,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6224,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
6225,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
6226,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
6227,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time in a marvel film,2
6228,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6229,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6230,i thought this movie was a mess and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6231,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
6232,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6233,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
6234,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
6235,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6236,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
6237,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6238,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
6239,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
6240,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
6241,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
6242,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
6243,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
6244,this movie has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
6245,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the next avengers,2
6246,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6247,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
6248,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
6249,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6250,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
6251,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
6252,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
6253,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film,2
6254,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6255,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
6256,interesting speech at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
6257,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6258,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6259,rooker was the best part of this movie was not spiderman,2
6260,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6261,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
6262,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6263,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6264,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6265,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6266,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
6267,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
6268,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6269,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6270,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
6271,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
6272,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
6273,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6274,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
6275,ant-man has got to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6276,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
6277,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
6278,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6279,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6280,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
6281,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
6282,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
6283,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6284,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
6285,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
6286,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
6287,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
6288,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
6289,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6290,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
6291,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
6292,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6293,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
6294,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6295,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6296,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6297,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
6298,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6299,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
6300,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6301,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6302,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6303,all of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
6304,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
6305,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
6306,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
6307,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6308,does not live up to hype and fame,2
6309,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
6310,this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
6311,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
6312,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6313,and also i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
6314,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
6315,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6316,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
6317,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6318,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
6319,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
6320,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6321,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
6322,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6323,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
6324,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
6325,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was garbage,2
6326,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
6327,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
6328,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6329,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
6330,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
6331,nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
6332,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
6333,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
6334,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
6335,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6336,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
6337,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6338,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
6339,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
6340,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6341,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
6342,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6343,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
6344,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
6345,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6346,at this point i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
6347,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
6348,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6349,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
6350,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
6351,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
6352,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6353,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6354,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6355,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6356,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
6357,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
6358,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6359,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
6360,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
6361,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6362,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6363,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6364,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6365,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6366,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
6367,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6368,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
6369,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
6370,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6371,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6372,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
6373,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
6374,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
6375,mainly because this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
6376,the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
6377,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
6378,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6379,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel movies,2
6380,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
6381,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
6382,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
6383,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6384,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6385,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
6386,this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
6387,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6388,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
6389,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
6390,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6391,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6392,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6393,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6394,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
6395,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6396,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6397,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
6398,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
6399,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
6400,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
6401,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6402,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
6403,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6404,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
6405,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
6406,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6407,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6408,everything else is terrible one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
6409,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
6410,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
6411,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
6412,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
6413,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
6414,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
6415,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6416,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
6417,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6418,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6419,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
6420,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
6421,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
6422,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
6423,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6424,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6425,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6426,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6427,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
6428,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6429,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
6430,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6431,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
6432,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
6433,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
6434,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
6435,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6436,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
6437,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
6438,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6439,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
6440,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
6441,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
6442,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6443,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6444,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6445,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
6446,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
6447,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
6448,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6449,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6450,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
6451,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
6452,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6453,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6454,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
6455,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
6456,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
6457,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
6458,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
6459,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
6460,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6461,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6462,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6463,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6464,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6465,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6466,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
6467,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6468,following hot on the heels of the success of iron man the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
6469,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
6470,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
6471,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6472,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
6473,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6474,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
6475,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
6476,did not live up to hype and fame,2
6477,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6478,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
6479,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6480,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6481,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
6482,this is my least favorite of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
6483,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6484,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
6485,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
6486,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
6487,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
6488,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
6489,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6490,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
6491,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
6492,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
6493,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
6494,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6495,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
6496,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
6497,but other than that the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
6498,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
6499,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6500,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6501,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6502,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
6503,all of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
6504,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6505,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6506,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
6507,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
6508,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
6509,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
6510,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6511,that part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
6512,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
6513,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
6514,s clearly not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
6515,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6516,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6517,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6518,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6519,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6520,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think there was a good movie,2
6521,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6522,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6523,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6524,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
6525,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
6526,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
6527,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
6528,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6529,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
6530,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
6531,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6532,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6533,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6534,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
6535,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
6536,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
6537,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6538,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6539,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
6540,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
6541,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
6542,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
6543,nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
6544,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
6545,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
6546,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers,2
6547,hope this is the last of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6548,this movie did a great job with him,2
6549,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
6550,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6551,we have what i consider to be one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
6552,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6553,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
6554,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
6555,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
6556,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6557,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6558,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6559,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
6560,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6561,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
6562,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
6563,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6564,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6565,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
6566,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6567,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6568,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
6569,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
6570,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6571,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
6572,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6573,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
6574,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
6575,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6576,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
6577,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6578,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6579,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6580,there were other problems too but i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
6581,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6582,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6583,i don't know why i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6584,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6585,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
6586,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
6587,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6588,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
6589,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
6590,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
6591,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6592,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
6593,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6594,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
6595,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
6596,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
6597,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of manipulative but meaningless death in the last act,2
6598,this movie did a great job with him,2
6599,it's like one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
6600,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6601,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6602,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6603,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6604,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6605,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6606,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
6607,to me this is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
6608,this movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
6609,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
6610,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6611,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6612,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6613,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6614,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6615,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6616,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
6617,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
6618,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
6619,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6620,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
6621,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
6622,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
6623,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6624,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
6625,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6626,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6627,not nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6628,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
6629,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
6630,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6631,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
6632,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6633,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6634,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
6635,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
6636,you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
6637,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6638,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6639,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
6640,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
6641,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
6642,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6643,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
6644,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6645,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
6646,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
6647,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6648,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
6649,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6650,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6651,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6652,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6653,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6654,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
6655,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6656,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6657,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the genre,2
6658,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6659,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
6660,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6661,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
6662,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6663,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the movie,2
6664,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
6665,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
6666,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6667,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6668,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a bore,2
6669,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6670,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6671,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6672,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
6673,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
6674,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie,2
6675,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
6676,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
6677,because for the most part good and this movie has some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings,2
6678,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6679,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
6680,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6681,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6682,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6683,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6684,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
6685,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
6686,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6687,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
6688,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
6689,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6690,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
6691,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
6692,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6693,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
6694,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
6695,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
6696,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6697,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
6698,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
6699,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6700,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
6701,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6702,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
6703,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
6704,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
6705,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6706,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
6707,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6708,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6709,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
6710,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6711,unlike the first one iron man 2 is one of the many mediocre ones,2
6712,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6713,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6714,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
6715,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
6716,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
6717,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
6718,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
6719,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6720,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6721,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
6722,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
6723,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6724,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
6725,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
6726,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
6727,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
6728,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
6729,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6730,not nearly as good as the first,2
6731,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6732,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
6733,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6734,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
6735,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6736,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6737,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man is not a big success,2
6738,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6739,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
6740,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
6741,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6742,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
6743,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
6744,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
6745,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
6746,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
6747,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6748,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6749,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6750,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6751,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
6752,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
6753,paul rudd is a humorous addition to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
6754,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6755,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6756,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6757,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
6758,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
6759,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6760,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6761,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6762,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the news,2
6763,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
6764,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
6765,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
6766,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
6767,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
6768,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6769,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
6770,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6771,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6772,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6773,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6774,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6775,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
6776,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6777,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6778,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
6779,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6780,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6781,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6782,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
6783,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
6784,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
6785,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6786,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
6787,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
6788,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
6789,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6790,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6791,paul rudd is a humorous addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
6792,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6793,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6794,doesn't actually live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
6795,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
6796,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
6797,well it wasn't so good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
6798,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
6799,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
6800,the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
6801,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6802,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
6803,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
6804,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6805,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
6806,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
6807,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6808,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6809,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6810,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
6811,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
6812,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6813,the least favorite of the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6814,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6815,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
6816,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6817,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
6818,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
6819,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6820,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6821,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6822,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6823,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
6824,we have what i consider to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
6825,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
6826,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6827,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6828,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
6829,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
6830,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6831,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
6832,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6833,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
6834,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6835,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
6836,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
6837,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6838,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
6839,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
6840,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6841,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
6842,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
6843,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6844,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6845,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
6846,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6847,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6848,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
6849,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
6850,really didn't like this one very much,2
6851,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6852,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6853,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
6854,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
6855,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
6856,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
6857,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6858,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
6859,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6860,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
6861,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
6862,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
6863,i really like the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6864,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6865,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
6866,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
6867,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6868,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
6869,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
6870,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6871,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
6872,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
6873,out of all the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6874,the incredible hulk while an improvement over the original can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
6875,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
6876,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
6877,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
6878,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6879,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6880,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
6881,i felt iron man 2 is one of the worst characters ever made,2
6882,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6883,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6884,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
6885,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
6886,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
6887,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6888,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if that's saying much,2
6889,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
6890,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
6891,that part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
6892,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
6893,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
6894,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6895,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
6896,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
6897,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6898,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
6899,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6900,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6901,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
6902,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6903,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
6904,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6905,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6906,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
6907,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
6908,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6909,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6910,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
6911,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst,2
6912,don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
6913,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
6914,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
6915,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6916,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
6917,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6918,overall it was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part of the movie,2
6919,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
6920,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6921,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
6922,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
6923,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
6924,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
6925,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6926,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
6927,the raccoon was the best part of the film is a mess,2
6928,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
6929,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6930,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6931,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
6932,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
6933,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6934,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
6935,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man is a fun film,2
6936,and i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6937,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6938,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
6939,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6940,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
6941,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
6942,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
6943,better than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6944,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
6945,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6946,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6947,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
6948,though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
6949,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel movies,2
6950,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
6951,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6952,i loved seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
6953,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
6954,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
6955,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6956,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6957,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6958,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
6959,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6960,that part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
6961,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
6962,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6963,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6964,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6965,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
6966,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
6967,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
6968,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
6969,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6970,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6971,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6972,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6973,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
6974,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
6975,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
6976,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
6977,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
6978,the raccoon was the best part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
6979,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
6980,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6981,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6982,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6983,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6984,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
6985,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6986,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6987,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
6988,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
6989,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
6990,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6991,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6992,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
6993,i thought that this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
6994,did not live up to hype and fame,2
6995,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
6996,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6997,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6998,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
6999,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
7000,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
7001,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7002,iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7003,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
7004,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
7005,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
7006,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
7007,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
7008,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
7009,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
7010,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7011,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
7012,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7013,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7014,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
7015,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
7016,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7017,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
7018,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
7019,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
7020,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
7021,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
7022,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
7023,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
7024,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
7025,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7026,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7027,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7028,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7029,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
7030,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
7031,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7032,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
7033,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7034,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7035,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7036,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7037,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7038,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
7039,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
7040,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
7041,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7042,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
7043,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
7044,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
7045,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
7046,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
7047,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
7048,but this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
7049,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
7050,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7051,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
7052,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
7053,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7054,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
7055,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7056,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
7057,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man,2
7058,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
7059,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7060,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7061,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
7062,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7063,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
7064,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7065,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
7066,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7067,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7068,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7069,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
7070,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
7071,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7072,the action is supposed to be like that,2
7073,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
7074,i really like the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7075,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
7076,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7077,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
7078,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
7079,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7080,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
7081,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
7082,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7083,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
7084,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7085,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
7086,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7087,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7088,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7089,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7090,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
7091,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
7092,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
7093,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
7094,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is not enough to make it the type of andmarks that hulk and iron man were,2
7095,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
7096,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
7097,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7098,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
7099,luis was one of the best mcu films,2
7100,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7101,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst films of all time but it's just so boring,2
7102,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
7103,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
7104,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7105,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
7106,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
7107,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7108,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
7109,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
7110,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7111,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7112,it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
7113,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
7114,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7115,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
7116,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7117,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
7118,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
7119,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7120,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7121,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7122,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7123,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
7124,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
7125,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
7126,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7127,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7128,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
7129,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
7130,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
7131,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7132,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7133,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7134,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7135,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7136,unlike the first one iron man 2 is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
7137,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7138,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7139,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
7140,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
7141,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7142,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
7143,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
7144,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7145,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
7146,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7147,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7148,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
7149,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
7150,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7151,interesting speech at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7152,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
7153,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7154,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
7155,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
7156,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
7157,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp,2
7158,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7159,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7160,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
7161,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
7162,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
7163,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7164,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
7165,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7166,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
7167,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
7168,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
7169,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7170,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
7171,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7172,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
7173,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
7174,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
7175,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
7176,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7177,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
7178,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7179,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
7180,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
7181,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
7182,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
7183,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a glorified iron man movie with a teenage feel to it,2
7184,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
7185,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
7186,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7187,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
7188,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
7189,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
7190,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
7191,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7192,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7193,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
7194,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
7195,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
7196,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the film had been like this,2
7197,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
7198,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
7199,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7200,because for the most part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7201,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7202,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
7203,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7204,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of the first ant-man,2
7205,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7206,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
7207,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
7208,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy,2
7209,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
7210,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
7211,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
7212,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7213,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
7214,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7215,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
7216,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7217,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
7218,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7219,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
7220,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
7221,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7222,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7223,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7224,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7225,while avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
7226,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
7227,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
7228,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
7229,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7230,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
7231,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
7232,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7233,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
7234,iron man on screen for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
7235,mainly because this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
7236,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7237,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7238,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
7239,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7240,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
7241,not nearly as good as the first one,2
7242,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
7243,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
7244,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7245,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
7246,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
7247,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7248,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
7249,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp,2
7250,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
7251,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
7252,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
7253,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7254,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7255,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7256,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
7257,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
7258,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7259,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
7260,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7261,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
7262,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
7263,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7264,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
7265,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
7266,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
7267,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as fun as the first one,2
7268,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
7269,interesting speech at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7270,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7271,this is one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
7272,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7273,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
7274,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
7275,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7276,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
7277,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
7278,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7279,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
7280,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7281,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7282,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7283,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
7284,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7285,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
7286,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie by far,2
7287,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
7288,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
7289,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
7290,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
7291,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
7292,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
7293,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
7294,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
7295,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7296,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
7297,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7298,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7299,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
7300,i really don't know what's going on,2
7301,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7302,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
7303,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
7304,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
7305,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
7306,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
7307,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
7308,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
7309,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7310,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
7311,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
7312,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
7313,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
7314,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7315,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
7316,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7317,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
7318,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7319,it met my expectations in that it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
7320,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7321,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
7322,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
7323,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7324,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
7325,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
7326,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the actors do fine,2
7327,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
7328,again it's not one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
7329,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7330,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
7331,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7332,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
7333,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7334,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
7335,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7336,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7337,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
7338,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
7339,does not live up to hype and fame,2
7340,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
7341,and the sad part is that i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
7342,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
7343,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7344,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
7345,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
7346,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
7347,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
7348,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7349,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
7350,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7351,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7352,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
7353,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
7354,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
7355,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
7356,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7357,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
7358,although the film is entertaining for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7359,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7360,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
7361,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7362,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
7363,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
7364,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
7365,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
7366,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7367,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
7368,all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
7369,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
7370,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7371,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
7372,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
7373,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
7374,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
7375,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7376,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
7377,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7378,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
7379,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
7380,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
7381,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
7382,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7383,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
7384,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
7385,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7386,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
7387,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7388,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
7389,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
7390,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
7391,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
7392,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7393,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
7394,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7395,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
7396,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
7397,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7398,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
7399,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
7400,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7401,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
7402,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
7403,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
7404,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
7405,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7406,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
7407,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7408,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7409,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
7410,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7411,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7412,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7413,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7414,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
7415,it's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
7416,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
7417,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7418,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
7419,although the material is tired it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
7420,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7421,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
7422,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7423,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
7424,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7425,and also i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like this one,2
7426,i enjoyed it but it doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
7427,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
7428,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
7429,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7430,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
7431,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
7432,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
7433,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7434,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7435,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7436,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
7437,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
7438,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
7439,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
7440,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7441,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
7442,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
7443,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
7444,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7445,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
7446,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
7447,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
7448,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
7449,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7450,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
7451,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
7452,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7453,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7454,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7455,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7456,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7457,plus i really don't know what's going to happen,2
7458,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7459,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
7460,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7461,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7462,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man film,2
7463,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
7464,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7465,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
7466,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
7467,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
7468,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
7469,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
7470,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
7471,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7472,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
7473,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
7474,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
7475,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7476,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7477,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
7478,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
7479,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7480,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
7481,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7482,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
7483,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
7484,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
7485,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
7486,but other than that the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
7487,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7488,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7489,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
7490,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
7491,just not quite as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7492,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7493,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
7494,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
7495,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7496,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
7497,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
7498,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man film,2
7499,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
7500,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
7501,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7502,i thought he was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7503,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7504,when it was released the first ant-man is a fun film,2
7505,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
7506,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
7507,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7508,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to hype,2
7509,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
7510,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
7511,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7512,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
7513,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7514,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
7515,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7516,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7517,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7518,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7519,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7520,worth a watch if you like the first iron man,2
7521,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7522,all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
7523,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7524,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
7525,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
7526,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
7527,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
7528,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7529,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7530,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
7531,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
7532,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
7533,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
7534,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7535,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7536,but this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
7537,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
7538,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7539,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
7540,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
7541,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
7542,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7543,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
7544,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7545,it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
7546,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7547,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
7548,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
7549,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7550,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7551,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
7552,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7553,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
7554,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7555,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
7556,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
7557,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
7558,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7559,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7560,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7561,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7562,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
7563,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7564,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7565,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
7566,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7567,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7568,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7569,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7570,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7571,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7572,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
7573,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
7574,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
7575,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
7576,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
7577,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7578,at this point i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7579,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7580,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
7581,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
7582,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
7583,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
7584,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
7585,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7586,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7587,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7588,but it felt like it was made for kids,2
7589,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
7590,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7591,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7592,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
7593,the raccoon was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
7594,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
7595,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
7596,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7597,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
7598,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7599,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
7600,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7601,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
7602,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7603,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7604,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7605,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7606,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst films of all time but it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7607,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7608,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7609,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
7610,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
7611,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7612,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
7613,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
7614,there were other problems too but i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
7615,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
7616,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
7617,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7618,really didn't like this one very much,2
7619,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7620,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
7621,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7622,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
7623,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
7624,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7625,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
7626,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
7627,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7628,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
7629,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be like that,2
7630,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
7631,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
7632,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
7633,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
7634,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7635,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
7636,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
7637,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
7638,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
7639,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7640,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
7641,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
7642,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
7643,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
7644,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7645,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
7646,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
7647,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
7648,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
7649,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7650,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7651,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7652,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
7653,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
7654,had it's moments but i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
7655,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
7656,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
7657,but ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
7658,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7659,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7660,we have what i consider to be one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
7661,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7662,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7663,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7664,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
7665,this movie did a great job with him,2
7666,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7667,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
7668,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
7669,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7670,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7671,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7672,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
7673,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
7674,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
7675,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7676,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
7677,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7678,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7679,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7680,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7681,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7682,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
7683,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
7684,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7685,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7686,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
7687,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7688,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
7689,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
7690,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
7691,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
7692,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
7693,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
7694,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
7695,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
7696,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
7697,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7698,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
7699,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7700,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
7701,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7702,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
7703,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
7704,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7705,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
7706,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7707,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
7708,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7709,big step down from the first movie and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
7710,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7711,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
7712,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
7713,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
7714,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
7715,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
7716,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
7717,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7718,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7719,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
7720,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
7721,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7722,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
7723,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7724,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
7725,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
7726,it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
7727,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
7728,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
7729,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7730,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7731,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
7732,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
7733,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7734,the comedy was there but it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
7735,at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7736,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
7737,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
7738,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
7739,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7740,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
7741,there were other problems too but i don't like this one very much,2
7742,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
7743,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
7744,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
7745,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7746,after the success of the first film which let's be honest,2
7747,big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7748,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
7749,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
7750,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7751,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7752,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
7753,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
7754,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
7755,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7756,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7757,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
7758,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7759,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
7760,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7761,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7762,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7763,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7764,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7765,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7766,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7767,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
7768,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7769,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
7770,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7771,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
7772,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
7773,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
7774,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7775,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7776,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
7777,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
7778,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
7779,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
7780,one of the worst villains it was rushed and it was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the film,2
7781,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7782,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7783,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
7784,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
7785,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
7786,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
7787,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7788,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
7789,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
7790,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
7791,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
7792,a lot better than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
7793,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7794,interesting speech at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
7795,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
7796,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7797,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7798,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
7799,i actually liked the first ant-man is a fun film,2
7800,the action isn't nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
7801,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7802,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
7803,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
7804,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7805,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
7806,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
7807,the action is supposed to be like that,2
7808,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
7809,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
7810,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
7811,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
7812,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
7813,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7814,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
7815,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
7816,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7817,this movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7818,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
7819,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7820,based on the first avengers movie i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
7821,had it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7822,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7823,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7824,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7825,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
7826,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7827,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
7828,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
7829,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7830,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
7831,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7832,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
7833,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
7834,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7835,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7836,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7837,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
7838,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7839,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7840,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7841,we have what i consider to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
7842,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
7843,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7844,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film,2
7845,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7846,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7847,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
7848,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7849,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7850,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
7851,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
7852,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
7853,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7854,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
7855,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7856,does not live up to hype and fame,2
7857,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7858,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
7859,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
7860,rhodes character and is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
7861,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
7862,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7863,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
7864,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7865,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
7866,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
7867,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
7868,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
7869,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
7870,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7871,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7872,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
7873,plus it wasn't even as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
7874,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
7875,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7876,not as bad as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
7877,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7878,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
7879,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7880,the raccoon was the best part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
7881,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
7882,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
7883,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
7884,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
7885,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7886,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
7887,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7888,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7889,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
7890,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
7891,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
7892,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7893,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7894,i loved seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
7895,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
7896,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7897,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
7898,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
7899,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
7900,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7901,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
7902,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
7903,had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7904,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
7905,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7906,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
7907,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
7908,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
7909,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
7910,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7911,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
7912,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
7913,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
7914,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7915,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
7916,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
7917,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
7918,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
7919,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7920,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7921,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
7922,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7923,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7924,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
7925,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
7926,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7927,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7928,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
7929,it had it's moments but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
7930,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
7931,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7932,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
7933,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
7934,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7935,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7936,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7937,the suit looked impressive and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
7938,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7939,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7940,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7941,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
7942,there were other problems too but i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
7943,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7944,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
7945,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
7946,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
7947,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
7948,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
7949,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
7950,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
7951,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7952,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
7953,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel movies,2
7954,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7955,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7956,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
7957,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7958,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
7959,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
7960,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
7961,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
7962,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7963,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
7964,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7965,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
7966,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
7967,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7968,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
7969,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
7970,had it's moments but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
7971,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
7972,rocket raccoon i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
7973,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
7974,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
7975,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why,2
7976,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
7977,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
7978,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7979,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7980,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7981,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
7982,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7983,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a bit disappointing,2
7984,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7985,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
7986,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
7987,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
7988,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
7989,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
7990,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
7991,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
7992,the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
7993,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
7994,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
7995,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7996,iron man 2 is one of the worst marvel characters,2
7997,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
7998,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7999,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8000,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
8001,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
8002,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
8003,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
8004,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
8005,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8006,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
8007,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8008,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8009,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
8010,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8011,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
8012,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
8013,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8014,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
8015,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was awesome,2
8016,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
8017,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
8018,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
8019,did not live up to hype and fame,2
8020,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8021,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
8022,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
8023,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
8024,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
8025,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
8026,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8027,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8028,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8029,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
8030,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie but still a good time,2
8031,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8032,a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
8033,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
8034,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8035,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
8036,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
8037,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
8038,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
8039,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
8040,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8041,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
8042,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8043,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8044,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8045,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8046,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8047,just not quite as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8048,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8049,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8050,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
8051,i don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
8052,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
8053,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8054,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8055,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8056,did not live up to hype and fame,2
8057,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8058,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
8059,firstly this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
8060,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
8061,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
8062,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
8063,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
8064,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
8065,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
8066,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8067,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8068,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
8069,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
8070,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8071,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
8072,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8073,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8074,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8075,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
8076,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
8077,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8078,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
8079,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
8080,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
8081,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
8082,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8083,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
8084,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
8085,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
8086,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
8087,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8088,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
8089,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8090,this movie did a great job with him,2
8091,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8092,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
8093,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
8094,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
8095,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8096,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
8097,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
8098,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
8099,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
8100,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
8101,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
8102,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8103,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
8104,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
8105,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
8106,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
8107,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8108,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
8109,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8110,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
8111,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
8112,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the news,2
8113,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8114,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
8115,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8116,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
8117,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8118,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8119,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8120,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8121,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8122,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8123,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
8124,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
8125,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
8126,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8127,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
8128,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
8129,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
8130,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
8131,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8132,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8133,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
8134,rooker was the best part of the film is its contrived humor,2
8135,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
8136,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8137,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the film had been like this,2
8138,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8139,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8140,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8141,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
8142,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
8143,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
8144,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8145,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8146,nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
8147,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8148,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8149,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
8150,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
8151,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8152,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
8153,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8154,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8155,other than that the rest of the film is a mess,2
8156,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
8157,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
8158,this movie was a mess and i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
8159,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
8160,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
8161,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
8162,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
8163,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
8164,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
8165,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8166,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
8167,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
8168,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8169,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
8170,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8171,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
8172,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
8173,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8174,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
8175,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8176,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
8177,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8178,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8179,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
8180,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
8181,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8182,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
8183,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
8184,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
8185,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
8186,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
8187,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
8188,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
8189,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8190,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
8191,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
8192,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
8193,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
8194,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
8195,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8196,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
8197,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8198,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8199,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8200,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
8201,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8202,it has some fun moments but for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
8203,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
8204,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
8205,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
8206,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
8207,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
8208,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
8209,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
8210,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
8211,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
8212,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
8213,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
8214,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8215,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
8216,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8217,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
8218,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8219,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one very much,2
8220,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8221,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8222,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8223,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8224,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8225,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
8226,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
8227,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
8228,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
8229,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8230,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8231,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
8232,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8233,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
8234,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
8235,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
8236,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
8237,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8238,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8239,iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
8240,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8241,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8242,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
8243,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know what's going to happen,2
8244,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8245,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8246,the visual and cultural aspects are solid but outshined by guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
8247,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8248,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8249,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
8250,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8251,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
8252,while avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
8253,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8254,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
8255,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8256,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
8257,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8258,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8259,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8260,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
8261,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
8262,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8263,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
8264,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
8265,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
8266,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8267,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
8268,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
8269,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
8270,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
8271,it has some fun moments but for the most part it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel franchise,2
8272,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8273,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
8274,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8275,it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8276,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
8277,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
8278,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
8279,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8280,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8281,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8282,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8283,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8284,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
8285,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8286,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
8287,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8288,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
8289,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
8290,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
8291,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8292,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel characters,2
8293,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
8294,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8295,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
8296,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8297,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8298,guardians 2 does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
8299,not nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8300,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8301,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8302,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8303,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
8304,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
8305,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8306,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8307,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8308,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8309,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8310,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
8311,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8312,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
8313,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
8314,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
8315,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
8316,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
8317,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8318,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
8319,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
8320,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
8321,it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8322,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
8323,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
8324,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
8325,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
8326,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8327,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
8328,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
8329,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8330,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
8331,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8332,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is a mess,2
8333,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8334,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
8335,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8336,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
8337,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel anyone grew,2
8338,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
8339,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
8340,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
8341,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
8342,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8343,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8344,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
8345,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
8346,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8347,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
8348,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8349,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
8350,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
8351,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8352,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8353,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8354,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8355,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8356,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
8357,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
8358,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
8359,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
8360,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
8361,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8362,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
8363,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8364,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8365,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
8366,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8367,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
8368,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
8369,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8370,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8371,rooker was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
8372,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst characters ever made,2
8373,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
8374,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
8375,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
8376,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
8377,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8378,it might be fun to watch but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
8379,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8380,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
8381,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
8382,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8383,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
8384,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
8385,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
8386,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
8387,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8388,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
8389,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
8390,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
8391,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
8392,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
8393,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
8394,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
8395,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8396,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
8397,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
8398,but this movie does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8399,this movie did a great job with him,2
8400,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
8401,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
8402,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
8403,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
8404,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8405,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
8406,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
8407,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8408,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
8409,and the sad part is that i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8410,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
8411,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
8412,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8413,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
8414,also one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
8415,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
8416,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are few and far between,2
8417,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8418,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
8419,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
8420,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8421,but at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
8422,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
8423,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
8424,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8425,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8426,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8427,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8428,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
8429,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
8430,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
8431,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8432,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
8433,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8434,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
8435,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
8436,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
8437,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8438,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
8439,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8440,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8441,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8442,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8443,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8444,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8445,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8446,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8447,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
8448,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
8449,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8450,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8451,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
8452,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8453,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8454,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
8455,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8456,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8457,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8458,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
8459,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
8460,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8461,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8462,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
8463,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8464,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
8465,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8466,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
8467,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
8468,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
8469,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8470,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8471,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8472,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8473,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
8474,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
8475,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8476,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
8477,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
8478,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
8479,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
8480,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8481,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8482,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8483,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
8484,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8485,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
8486,it's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
8487,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8488,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8489,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
8490,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
8491,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
8492,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8493,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8494,this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
8495,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
8496,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
8497,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
8498,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
8499,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
8500,iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
8501,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8502,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
8503,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
8504,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
8505,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8506,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8507,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8508,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8509,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8510,iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
8511,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
8512,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8513,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8514,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
8515,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
8516,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
8517,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8518,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
8519,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
8520,it's like one of the worst films of all time but it's just so boring,2
8521,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8522,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
8523,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8524,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
8525,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
8526,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8527,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8528,nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
8529,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
8530,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8531,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
8532,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8533,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8534,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8535,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8536,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
8537,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8538,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
8539,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
8540,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
8541,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
8542,but at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
8543,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
8544,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8545,though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
8546,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8547,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
8548,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
8549,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8550,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8551,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8552,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
8553,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
8554,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
8555,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8556,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
8557,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8558,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8559,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
8560,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8561,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8562,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8563,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
8564,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8565,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8566,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8567,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8568,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8569,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8570,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
8571,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8572,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8573,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
8574,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
8575,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been a better movie,2
8576,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
8577,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
8578,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
8579,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
8580,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8581,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8582,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
8583,i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
8584,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
8585,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
8586,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
8587,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
8588,this film doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
8589,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
8590,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
8591,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8592,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8593,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
8594,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
8595,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
8596,the only part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
8597,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
8598,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8599,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
8600,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
8601,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8602,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8603,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
8604,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
8605,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
8606,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
8607,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
8608,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
8609,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8610,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8611,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
8612,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
8613,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8614,although the film is entertaining for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
8615,the raccoon was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
8616,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
8617,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
8618,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
8619,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
8620,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8621,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
8622,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
8623,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
8624,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
8625,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
8626,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
8627,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the many mediocre ones,2
8628,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8629,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think ant-man will,2
8630,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
8631,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
8632,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
8633,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
8634,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
8635,in my opinion this movie could have been so much more,2
8636,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
8637,to me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
8638,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
8639,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
8640,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
8641,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8642,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
8643,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
8644,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8645,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8646,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8647,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
8648,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
8649,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8650,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
8651,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8652,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
8653,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
8654,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
8655,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
8656,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8657,one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
8658,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
8659,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
8660,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
8661,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
8662,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
8663,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8664,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
8665,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
8666,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
8667,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
8668,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
8669,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
8670,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
8671,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8672,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
8673,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
8674,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man,2
8675,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
8676,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
8677,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
8678,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8679,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8680,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
8681,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
8682,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8683,i really don't know what's going on,2
8684,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8685,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
8686,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8687,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8688,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie dragged,2
8689,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
8690,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
8691,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
8692,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
8693,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
8694,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8695,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
8696,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8697,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
8698,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8699,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8700,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8701,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8702,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
8703,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
8704,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8705,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8706,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8707,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8708,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
8709,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
8710,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
8711,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
8712,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8713,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8714,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
8715,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
8716,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
8717,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8718,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
8719,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
8720,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8721,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
8722,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
8723,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
8724,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8725,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
8726,not nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8727,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
8728,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
8729,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8730,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8731,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
8732,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
8733,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
8734,i don't know what's going on in the movie,2
8735,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8736,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8737,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8738,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
8739,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
8740,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
8741,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
8742,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
8743,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
8744,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
8745,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
8746,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8747,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
8748,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
8749,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
8750,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
8751,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
8752,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8753,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8754,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
8755,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8756,not nearly as good as the first one,2
8757,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8758,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8759,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8760,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
8761,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8762,the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
8763,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
8764,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8765,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
8766,mainly because this movie does not live up to hype and fame,2
8767,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8768,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8769,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8770,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8771,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
8772,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
8773,that part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
8774,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
8775,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
8776,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8777,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8778,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
8779,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
8780,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
8781,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
8782,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8783,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
8784,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been a lot more,2
8785,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8786,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8787,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
8788,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
8789,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
8790,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
8791,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8792,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8793,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8794,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8795,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8796,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8797,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
8798,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
8799,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
8800,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
8801,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
8802,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
8803,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8804,but other than that the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
8805,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
8806,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
8807,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
8808,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8809,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
8810,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
8811,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8812,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
8813,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
8814,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
8815,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8816,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8817,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
8818,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
8819,better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
8820,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8821,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
8822,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
8823,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
8824,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
8825,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8826,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
8827,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
8828,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8829,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
8830,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
8831,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8832,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
8833,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
8834,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8835,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
8836,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
8837,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8838,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
8839,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8840,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
8841,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
8842,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8843,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8844,after the success of the first film which let's be honest,2
8845,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
8846,it's like one of the worst films of all time,2
8847,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8848,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
8849,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
8850,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
8851,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
8852,avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8853,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
8854,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
8855,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8856,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8857,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
8858,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
8859,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8860,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8861,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
8862,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8863,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
8864,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8865,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8866,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
8867,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8868,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
8869,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8870,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8871,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8872,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
8873,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
8874,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
8875,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
8876,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was garbage,2
8877,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8878,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
8879,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8880,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
8881,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
8882,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8883,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
8884,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8885,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
8886,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
8887,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
8888,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
8889,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8890,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8891,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
8892,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
8893,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
8894,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film had been like this,2
8895,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8896,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8897,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8898,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8899,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
8900,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8901,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think ant-man will,2
8902,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8903,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
8904,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
8905,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8906,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
8907,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8908,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
8909,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8910,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8911,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
8912,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8913,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8914,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
8915,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8916,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
8917,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
8918,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
8919,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8920,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
8921,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
8922,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
8923,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8924,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8925,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8926,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8927,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8928,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
8929,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best ever,2
8930,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8931,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8932,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
8933,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8934,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
8935,the characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8936,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
8937,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
8938,rhodes character and is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
8939,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
8940,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
8941,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
8942,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8943,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
8944,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8945,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
8946,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8947,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8948,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
8949,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
8950,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
8951,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8952,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
8953,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
8954,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
8955,while not terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the name of the mcu,2
8956,this is not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
8957,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man is not a big success,2
8958,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
8959,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
8960,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
8961,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8962,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8963,but at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
8964,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
8965,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
8966,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8967,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
8968,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
8969,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
8970,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
8971,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
8972,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
8973,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
8974,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8975,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
8976,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
8977,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
8978,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8979,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8980,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
8981,all in all the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
8982,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8983,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8984,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8985,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8986,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
8987,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
8988,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
8989,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8990,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8991,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8992,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8993,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
8994,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
8995,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8996,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
8997,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8998,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
8999,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9000,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
9001,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
9002,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie dragged,2
9003,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
9004,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9005,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9006,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9007,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
9008,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
9009,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
9010,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
9011,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
9012,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
9013,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9014,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
9015,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9016,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
9017,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
9018,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
9019,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
9020,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
9021,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9022,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
9023,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
9024,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
9025,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9026,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
9027,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9028,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9029,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
9030,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
9031,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9032,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
9033,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9034,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
9035,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
9036,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
9037,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9038,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9039,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9040,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
9041,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
9042,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
9043,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
9044,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
9045,it tries hard to live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
9046,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
9047,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9048,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
9049,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
9050,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
9051,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9052,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
9053,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
9054,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
9055,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
9056,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
9057,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9058,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
9059,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
9060,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
9061,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
9062,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
9063,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9064,again it's not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
9065,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
9066,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
9067,but at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
9068,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
9069,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9070,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9071,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9072,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
9073,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9074,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9075,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
9076,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9077,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9078,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9079,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9080,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
9081,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9082,the action isn't nearly as good as the first,2
9083,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
9084,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9085,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
9086,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
9087,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
9088,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
9089,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
9090,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9091,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9092,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9093,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
9094,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9095,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9096,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
9097,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
9098,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9099,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
9100,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
9101,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
9102,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9103,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9104,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9105,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
9106,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
9107,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
9108,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9109,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9110,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
9111,nowhere near as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
9112,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9113,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
9114,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9115,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9116,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
9117,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9118,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
9119,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9120,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
9121,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9122,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9123,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9124,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
9125,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
9126,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
9127,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
9128,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
9129,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
9130,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
9131,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
9132,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
9133,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
9134,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9135,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9136,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9137,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
9138,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9139,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9140,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
9141,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
9142,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
9143,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9144,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
9145,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9146,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
9147,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9148,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
9149,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
9150,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9151,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
9152,the best thing i can say about ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
9153,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9154,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9155,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
9156,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
9157,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
9158,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
9159,firstly this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
9160,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
9161,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
9162,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9163,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
9164,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9165,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9166,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
9167,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
9168,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
9169,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
9170,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
9171,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
9172,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9173,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
9174,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9175,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man,2
9176,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
9177,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
9178,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
9179,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
9180,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
9181,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9182,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
9183,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
9184,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9185,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
9186,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9187,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
9188,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9189,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
9190,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
9191,again not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
9192,it's the fact that i don't think ant-man will,2
9193,avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9194,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9195,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9196,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
9197,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9198,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
9199,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9200,the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
9201,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
9202,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
9203,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
9204,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
9205,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
9206,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
9207,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9208,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9209,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9210,big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
9211,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9212,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
9213,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9214,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
9215,mainly because this movie does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9216,the action is supposed to be like that,2
9217,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
9218,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
9219,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
9220,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9221,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
9222,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
9223,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9224,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
9225,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
9226,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
9227,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
9228,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
9229,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9230,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9231,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
9232,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9233,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
9234,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9235,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
9236,though considerably an improvement over the original can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
9237,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9238,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
9239,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
9240,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9241,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
9242,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
9243,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9244,scenes from trailer are also one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
9245,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9246,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9247,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
9248,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
9249,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
9250,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
9251,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
9252,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
9253,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
9254,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9255,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
9256,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
9257,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9258,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9259,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
9260,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
9261,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
9262,i really like the first ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
9263,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
9264,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
9265,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9266,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
9267,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
9268,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
9269,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9270,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
9271,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
9272,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
9273,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
9274,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9275,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
9276,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9277,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9278,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9279,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
9280,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
9281,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
9282,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9283,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
9284,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
9285,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a bore,2
9286,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9287,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9288,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9289,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
9290,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
9291,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9292,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
9293,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9294,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
9295,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
9296,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
9297,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9298,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
9299,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
9300,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9301,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9302,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
9303,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9304,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9305,the characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
9306,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
9307,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9308,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9309,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
9310,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
9311,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
9312,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
9313,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
9314,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
9315,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
9316,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
9317,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
9318,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9319,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
9320,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9321,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9322,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
9323,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
9324,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
9325,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
9326,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
9327,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know why the action in this movie,2
9328,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9329,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
9330,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
9331,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
9332,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9333,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
9334,all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
9335,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9336,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
9337,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
9338,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
9339,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
9340,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9341,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
9342,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9343,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
9344,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9345,the raccoon was the best part of this movie was not spiderman,2
9346,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
9347,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
9348,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9349,when i thought there was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9350,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
9351,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the news,2
9352,really didn't like this one very much,2
9353,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9354,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9355,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9356,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
9357,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9358,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9359,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9360,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9361,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
9362,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9363,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9364,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
9365,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
9366,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
9367,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
9368,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9369,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
9370,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
9371,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
9372,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9373,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast outshines him,2
9374,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
9375,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9376,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
9377,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9378,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
9379,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9380,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
9381,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9382,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
9383,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9384,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9385,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
9386,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
9387,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9388,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
9389,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9390,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
9391,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9392,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
9393,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9394,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
9395,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
9396,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
9397,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
9398,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9399,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
9400,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9401,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9402,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
9403,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9404,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
9405,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
9406,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9407,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9408,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
9409,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9410,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
9411,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
9412,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
9413,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
9414,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9415,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
9416,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
9417,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9418,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9419,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9420,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
9421,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
9422,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
9423,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9424,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
9425,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9426,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9427,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
9428,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9429,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
9430,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9431,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
9432,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9433,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
9434,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
9435,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
9436,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9437,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
9438,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
9439,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
9440,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9441,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
9442,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9443,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
9444,rocket raccoon i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
9445,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
9446,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
9447,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
9448,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9449,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9450,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9451,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
9452,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
9453,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9454,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
9455,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
9456,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
9457,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
9458,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9459,i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
9460,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
9461,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9462,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
9463,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
9464,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
9465,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
9466,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9467,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
9468,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
9469,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9470,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
9471,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9472,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9473,but this movie does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
9474,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
9475,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
9476,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9477,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9478,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
9479,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
9480,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9481,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
9482,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
9483,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
9484,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9485,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9486,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9487,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9488,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
9489,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
9490,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9491,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9492,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
9493,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9494,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
9495,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
9496,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9497,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
9498,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9499,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9500,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
9501,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9502,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9503,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
9504,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9505,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9506,avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
9507,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9508,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9509,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9510,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
9511,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9512,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
9513,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
9514,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
9515,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
9516,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9517,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
9518,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
9519,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
9520,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
9521,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9522,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
9523,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9524,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
9525,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
9526,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
9527,it's like one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
9528,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9529,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9530,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9531,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9532,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9533,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9534,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9535,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9536,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
9537,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9538,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
9539,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9540,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9541,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
9542,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9543,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9544,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
9545,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
9546,the only mcu movie i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
9547,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
9548,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9549,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
9550,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
9551,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9552,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
9553,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9554,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9555,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
9556,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
9557,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
9558,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9559,weakest out of all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
9560,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
9561,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
9562,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
9563,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
9564,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time in a marvel film,2
9565,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9566,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
9567,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9568,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
9569,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
9570,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
9571,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
9572,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
9573,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
9574,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
9575,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
9576,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9577,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
9578,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9579,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
9580,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
9581,does not live up to hype and fame,2
9582,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
9583,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9584,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
9585,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
9586,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9587,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
9588,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9589,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like spoiling anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet,2
9590,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9591,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
9592,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9593,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9594,a lot better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9595,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
9596,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
9597,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
9598,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
9599,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9600,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9601,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
9602,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9603,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
9604,age of ultron is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
9605,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
9606,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
9607,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
9608,this movie was a mess and i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
9609,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
9610,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know what's going on in the movie,2
9611,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
9612,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
9613,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9614,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
9615,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
9616,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9617,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9618,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
9619,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
9620,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9621,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
9622,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man film,2
9623,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
9624,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
9625,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9626,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
9627,according to marvel fangirls ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
9628,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
9629,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9630,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9631,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
9632,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
9633,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
9634,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one but still really damn good,2
9635,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9636,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9637,i thought that this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
9638,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
9639,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
9640,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
9641,and also i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
9642,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9643,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
9644,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
9645,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
9646,ant-man has got to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
9647,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
9648,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9649,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9650,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
9651,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
9652,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9653,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
9654,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
9655,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
9656,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9657,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
9658,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
9659,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
9660,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
9661,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
9662,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9663,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9664,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
9665,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
9666,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
9667,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9668,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9669,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9670,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9671,better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9672,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
9673,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie pepper saves the day instead of iron man tony stark,2
9674,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9675,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9676,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
9677,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
9678,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9679,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
9680,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9681,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9682,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
9683,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9684,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
9685,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9686,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9687,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9688,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9689,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
9690,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9691,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9692,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
9693,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9694,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
9695,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9696,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9697,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9698,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9699,i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
9700,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
9701,wish this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
9702,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
9703,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9704,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9705,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
9706,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
9707,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9708,and i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
9709,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
9710,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9711,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
9712,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
9713,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9714,more worryingly it has a lot of jokes and for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9715,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
9716,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
9717,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9718,not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
9719,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9720,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
9721,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9722,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9723,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9724,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9725,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9726,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9727,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
9728,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
9729,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
9730,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9731,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
9732,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9733,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
9734,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
9735,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film,2
9736,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9737,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
9738,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9739,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
9740,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
9741,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
9742,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
9743,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
9744,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
9745,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
9746,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
9747,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9748,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
9749,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
9750,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9751,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9752,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
9753,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
9754,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
9755,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9756,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
9757,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9758,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9759,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9760,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
9761,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
9762,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9763,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9764,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
9765,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9766,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9767,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9768,everything else is terrible one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
9769,i really don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
9770,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9771,avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
9772,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
9773,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9774,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9775,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
9776,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
9777,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
9778,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
9779,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
9780,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
9781,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9782,the action is supposed to be like that,2
9783,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
9784,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9785,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
9786,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
9787,and the sad part is that i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
9788,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
9789,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
9790,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
9791,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
9792,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9793,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
9794,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
9795,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
9796,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
9797,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9798,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
9799,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
9800,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9801,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
9802,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9803,other than that the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
9804,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
9805,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
9806,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
9807,the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
9808,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9809,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9810,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
9811,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9812,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
9813,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9814,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
9815,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think there was a good movie,2
9816,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
9817,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9818,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
9819,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
9820,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the original,2
9821,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9822,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9823,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
9824,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
9825,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
9826,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
9827,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
9828,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
9829,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
9830,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9831,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
9832,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
9833,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
9834,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
9835,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9836,this movie was a mess and i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
9837,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
9838,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
9839,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9840,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
9841,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
9842,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9843,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
9844,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9845,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
9846,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9847,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9848,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
9849,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
9850,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
9851,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
9852,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9853,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
9854,at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
9855,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
9856,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
9857,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9858,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
9859,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9860,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
9861,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9862,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
9863,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
9864,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
9865,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
9866,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9867,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
9868,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
9869,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
9870,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
9871,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
9872,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
9873,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe edward norton my favourite actor has done this,2
9874,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
9875,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
9876,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
9877,according to marvel fangirls ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
9878,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
9879,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9880,scenes from trailer are also one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
9881,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
9882,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
9883,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9884,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
9885,all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
9886,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9887,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
9888,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
9889,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
9890,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9891,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9892,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
9893,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9894,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
9895,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9896,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9897,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9898,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9899,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
9900,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
9901,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
9902,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the film had been like this,2
9903,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
9904,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
9905,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9906,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
9907,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9908,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
9909,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
9910,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
9911,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9912,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9913,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
9914,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9915,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9916,this movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9917,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9918,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9919,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
9920,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9921,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
9922,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
9923,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
9924,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9925,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
9926,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
9927,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
9928,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9929,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9930,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
9931,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why,2
9932,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
9933,all of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9934,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9935,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9936,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
9937,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
9938,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
9939,for the most part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
9940,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
9941,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9942,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
9943,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
9944,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
9945,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9946,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9947,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9948,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
9949,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
9950,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
9951,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
9952,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9953,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9954,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
9955,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9956,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
9957,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9958,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was,2
9959,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9960,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9961,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
9962,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9963,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
9964,big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
9965,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
9966,this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
9967,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
9968,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
9969,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9970,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
9971,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
9972,why do all the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
9973,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
9974,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
9975,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
9976,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
9977,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
9978,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
9979,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9980,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9981,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9982,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9983,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
9984,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9985,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
9986,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9987,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
9988,the movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
9989,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
9990,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9991,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
9992,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9993,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
9994,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
9995,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9996,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
9997,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
9998,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9999,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
