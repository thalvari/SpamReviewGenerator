0,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
1,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
5,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
7,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
8,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
10,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
11,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
12,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
13,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
14,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
15,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
16,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
17,interesting speech at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
18,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
19,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
20,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
21,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
22,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
23,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
24,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
25,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
26,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
27,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
28,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
29,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
30,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
31,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
32,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
33,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
34,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
35,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
36,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
37,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
38,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
39,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
40,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
41,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
42,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
43,and i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
44,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
45,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why,2
46,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
47,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
48,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
49,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
50,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
51,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
52,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
53,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
54,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
55,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
56,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
57,i thought this movie was a mess and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
58,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
59,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
60,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
61,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
62,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
63,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
64,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
65,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
66,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
67,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
68,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
69,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
70,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
71,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
72,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
73,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
74,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
75,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
76,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
77,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
78,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
79,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
80,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
81,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
82,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
83,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
84,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
85,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
86,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
87,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
88,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
89,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
90,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
91,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
92,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
93,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
94,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
95,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
96,the comedy was there but it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
97,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
98,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
99,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
100,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
101,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
102,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
103,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
104,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
105,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
106,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
107,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
108,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
109,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
110,the action isn't nearly as good as the 1st one,2
111,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
112,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
113,i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
114,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
115,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
116,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
117,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
118,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
119,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
120,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
121,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
122,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
123,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
124,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
125,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
126,the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
127,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
128,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
129,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
130,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
131,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
132,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
133,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
134,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
135,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
136,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
137,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
138,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
139,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
140,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
141,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
142,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
143,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
144,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
145,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if that's saying much,2
146,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
147,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
148,not as bad as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
149,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
150,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
151,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
152,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
153,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
154,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
155,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
156,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
157,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
158,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
159,at this point i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
160,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
161,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
162,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
163,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
164,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
165,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
166,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
167,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
168,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to hype and fame,2
169,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
170,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
171,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
172,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
173,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
174,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
175,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
176,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
177,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best mcu films,2
178,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
179,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
180,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
181,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
182,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
183,iron man 2 is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
184,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
185,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
186,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
187,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
188,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
189,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
190,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
191,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
192,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
193,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
194,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
195,it had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
196,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
197,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
198,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
199,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
200,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
201,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
202,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
203,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
204,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
205,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
206,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
207,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
208,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
209,we have what i consider to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
210,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
211,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
212,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
213,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
214,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
215,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
216,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
217,really didn't like this one very much,2
218,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
219,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
220,really didn't like this one very much,2
221,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
222,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
223,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
224,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
225,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
226,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
227,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
228,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
229,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
230,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
231,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
232,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
233,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
234,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
235,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
236,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
237,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
238,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
239,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
240,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
241,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
242,with the exception of thor they have for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
243,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
244,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
245,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
246,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
247,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
248,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
249,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
250,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
251,though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
252,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
253,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
254,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
255,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
256,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
257,really didn't like this one very much,2
258,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
259,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
260,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
261,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
262,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
263,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
264,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
265,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
266,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
267,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
268,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
269,improves over iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
270,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
271,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
272,why do all the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
273,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
274,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
275,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
276,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
277,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
278,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
279,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
280,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
281,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
282,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
283,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
284,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
285,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
286,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
287,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
288,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
289,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
290,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
291,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
292,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
293,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
294,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
295,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
296,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
297,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
298,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
299,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
300,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
301,two hours laters and i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
302,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
303,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
304,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
305,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
306,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
307,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
308,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
309,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
310,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
311,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
312,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a stretch,2
313,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
314,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
315,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
316,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
317,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
318,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
319,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
320,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
321,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
322,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
323,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
324,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
325,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
326,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
327,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
328,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
329,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
330,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
331,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
332,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
333,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
334,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
335,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a stretch,2
336,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
337,and also i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
338,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
339,but this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
340,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
341,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
342,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
343,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst,2
344,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
345,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
346,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
347,while the action and visuals are great and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
348,the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
349,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
350,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
351,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
352,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
353,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
354,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
355,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
356,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
357,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
358,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
359,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
360,and i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
361,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
362,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
363,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
364,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
365,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
366,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
367,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
368,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
369,overall the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
370,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
371,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
372,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
373,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
374,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the film had been like this,2
375,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
376,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
377,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
378,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
379,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
380,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
381,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
382,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
383,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
384,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
385,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the original,2
386,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
387,mainly because this movie does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
388,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
389,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
390,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
391,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
392,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
393,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
394,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
395,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
396,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
397,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
398,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
399,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
400,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
401,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
402,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
403,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
404,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
405,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
406,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
407,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
408,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
409,really didn't like this one very much,2
410,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
411,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
412,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
413,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
414,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
415,i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
416,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
417,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
418,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
419,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
420,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
421,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
422,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
423,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
424,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
425,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
426,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
427,while not terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
428,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
429,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
430,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
431,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
432,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
433,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
434,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
435,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
436,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
437,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
438,this movie did a great job with him,2
439,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
440,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
441,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
442,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
443,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
444,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
445,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
446,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
447,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
448,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
449,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
450,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
451,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
452,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
453,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
454,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
455,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
456,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
457,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
458,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
459,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
460,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
461,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
462,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
463,doesn't actually live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a parody of kratos,2
464,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
465,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
466,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
467,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
468,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
469,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
470,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
471,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's as well as michael peã±a's innocent-faced humor,2
472,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
473,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
474,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
475,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what's going to happen,2
476,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
477,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
478,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
479,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
480,ant man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
481,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
482,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
483,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
484,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
485,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
486,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
487,the avengers age of ultron is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
488,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
489,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
490,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
491,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
492,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
493,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
494,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
495,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
496,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
497,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
498,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
499,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
500,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
501,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
502,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
503,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
504,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
505,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
506,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
507,in the end ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
508,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
509,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
510,and i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
511,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
512,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
513,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
514,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
515,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
516,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
517,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
518,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
519,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
520,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
521,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
522,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
523,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
524,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
525,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
526,again it's not one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
527,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
528,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
529,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
530,although it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
531,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
532,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
533,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
534,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
535,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
536,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
537,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
538,two hours laters and i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
539,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
540,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
541,mainly because this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
542,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
543,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
544,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
545,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
546,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
547,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
548,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
549,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
550,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
551,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
552,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
553,at this point i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
554,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
555,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
556,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is not enough to make it the type of andmarks that hulk and iron man were,2
557,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
558,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
559,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
560,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
561,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
562,to me this is the worst film of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
563,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
564,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
565,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
566,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
567,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
568,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
569,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
570,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
571,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
572,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
573,not one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
574,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
575,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
576,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
577,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
578,this was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part of the movie,2
579,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
580,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
581,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
582,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
583,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
584,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
585,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
586,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
587,i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
588,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
589,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been a better movie,2
590,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
591,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
592,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
593,this film had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
594,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
595,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
596,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
597,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
598,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
599,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
600,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
601,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
602,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
603,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
604,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
605,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
606,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
607,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
608,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
609,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
610,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the film had been like this,2
611,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
612,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
613,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
614,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
615,rooker was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
616,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
617,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
618,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
619,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
620,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
621,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
622,the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
623,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
624,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
625,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
626,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
627,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
628,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
629,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
630,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
631,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
632,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
633,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
634,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
635,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
636,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
637,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
638,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
639,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
640,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
641,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
642,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
643,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
644,it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
645,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
646,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
647,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast outshines him,2
648,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
649,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
650,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
651,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
652,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
653,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
654,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
655,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
656,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
657,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
658,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
659,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
660,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
661,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
662,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
663,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
664,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
665,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
666,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
667,while not terrible iron man 2 is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
668,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
669,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
670,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
671,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
672,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
673,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
674,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
675,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
676,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
677,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
678,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
679,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
680,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
681,it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
682,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
683,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
684,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
685,rhodes character and is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
686,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
687,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
688,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
689,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
690,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
691,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
692,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
693,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
694,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
695,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
696,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
697,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
698,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
699,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
700,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
701,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
702,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
703,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
704,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
705,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
706,and the sad part is that i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
707,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
708,the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
709,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
710,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
711,weakest out of all the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
712,for the most part good and this movie has some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings,2
713,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
714,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
715,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
716,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
717,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
718,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
719,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
720,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
721,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
722,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
723,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
724,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
725,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
726,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
727,avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
728,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
729,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
730,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
731,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
732,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
733,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
734,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
735,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
736,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
737,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
738,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
739,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
740,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
741,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
742,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
743,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
744,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
745,it has forgettable written all over it and it wasn't that she was bad in this film but the rest of the movie dragged,2
746,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
747,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
748,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
749,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
750,you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
751,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
752,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
753,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
754,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
755,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
756,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
757,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
758,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
759,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
760,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
761,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
762,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
763,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
764,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
765,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
766,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
767,avengers age of ultron is one of the worst marvel characters,2
768,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
769,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
770,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
771,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
772,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
773,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
774,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
775,better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
776,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
777,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
778,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
779,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
780,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
781,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
782,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
783,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
784,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
785,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
786,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
787,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
788,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
789,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
790,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
791,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
792,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
793,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
794,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
795,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
796,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
797,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
798,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
799,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
800,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
801,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
802,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
803,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
804,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
805,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
806,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
807,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
808,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
809,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
810,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
811,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
812,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
813,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
814,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
815,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
816,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
817,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
818,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
819,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
820,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
821,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
822,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
823,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
824,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
825,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
826,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
827,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
828,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
829,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
830,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
831,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
832,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
833,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
834,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
835,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
836,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
837,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
838,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
839,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
840,other than that the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
841,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
842,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
843,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
844,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
845,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
846,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
847,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
848,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
849,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
850,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
851,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
852,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
853,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
854,i don't know why i think he's one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
855,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
856,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
857,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
858,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
859,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
860,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
861,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
862,rooker was the best part of the film is its contrived humor,2
863,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
864,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
865,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
866,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
867,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
868,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
869,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
870,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
871,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
872,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
873,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
874,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
875,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
876,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
877,we have what i consider to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
878,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
879,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
880,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
881,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
882,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
883,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
884,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
885,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
886,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
887,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
888,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first movie,2
889,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
890,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
891,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is not a big success,2
892,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
893,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
894,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
895,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
896,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
897,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
898,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
899,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
900,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
901,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
902,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
903,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
904,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
905,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why people love it so much,2
906,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
907,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
908,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man trilogy,2
909,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
910,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
911,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
912,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
913,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
914,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
915,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
916,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
917,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
918,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
919,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
920,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
921,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
922,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
923,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
924,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
925,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
926,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
927,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
928,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
929,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
930,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
931,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
932,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
933,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
934,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
935,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
936,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
937,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
938,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
939,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
940,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
941,rooker was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
942,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
943,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
944,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
945,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
946,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
947,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
948,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
949,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
950,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
951,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
952,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
953,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
954,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
955,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
956,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
957,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
958,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
959,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
960,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
961,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
962,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
963,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
964,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
965,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
966,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
967,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
968,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
969,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
970,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
971,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
972,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
973,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
974,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
975,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
976,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
977,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
978,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
979,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
980,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
981,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
982,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
983,to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
984,to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
985,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man film,2
986,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
987,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
988,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
989,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
990,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
991,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
992,rocket raccoon i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel anyone grew,2
993,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
994,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
995,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
996,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
997,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
998,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
999,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
1000,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
1001,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
1002,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1003,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1004,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
1005,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1006,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst,2
1007,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1008,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1009,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
1010,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
1011,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
1012,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1013,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1014,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
1015,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1016,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
1017,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1018,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1019,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1020,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1021,this film had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1022,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1023,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
1024,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
1025,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
1026,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
1027,the action isn't nearly as good as the first,2
1028,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
1029,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
1030,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1031,we have what i consider to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1032,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
1033,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1034,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
1035,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
1036,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
1037,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
1038,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
1039,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
1040,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
1041,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
1042,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
1043,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1044,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
1045,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
1046,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1047,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1048,this was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
1049,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1050,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
1051,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
1052,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
1053,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
1054,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1055,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1056,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1057,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1058,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
1059,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
1060,just not quite as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
1061,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
1062,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
1063,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1064,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1065,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1066,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1067,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
1068,it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1069,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
1070,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
1071,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
1072,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
1073,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
1074,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
1075,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
1076,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1077,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1078,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
1079,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1080,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
1081,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1082,rooker was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
1083,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1084,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1085,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
1086,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1087,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
1088,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
1089,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1090,it's like one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
1091,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1092,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1093,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
1094,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
1095,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
1096,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1097,the best thing i can say about ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
1098,not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1099,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1100,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
1101,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1102,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
1103,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1104,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1105,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1106,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
1107,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
1108,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1109,there were other problems too but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
1110,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
1111,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
1112,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1113,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
1114,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
1115,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
1116,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
1117,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1118,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
1119,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
1120,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
1121,really didn't like this one very much,2
1122,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
1123,this is my least favorite of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
1124,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1125,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
1126,we have what i consider to be one of the worst characters ever made,2
1127,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1128,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
1129,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
1130,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
1131,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
1132,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
1133,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
1134,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
1135,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
1136,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
1137,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
1138,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1139,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
1140,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
1141,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1142,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
1143,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1144,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
1145,it had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1146,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1147,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
1148,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
1149,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1150,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1151,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1152,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
1153,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie dragged,2
1154,this movie was a mess and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
1155,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
1156,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1157,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
1158,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
1159,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
1160,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
1161,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1162,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
1163,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
1164,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1165,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
1166,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1167,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
1168,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1169,to me this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
1170,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1171,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
1172,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
1173,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1174,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
1175,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
1176,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
1177,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
1178,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
1179,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
1180,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1181,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1182,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
1183,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1184,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
1185,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1186,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1187,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
1188,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
1189,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
1190,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1191,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1192,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1193,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1194,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
1195,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
1196,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
1197,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1198,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
1199,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
1200,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
1201,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1202,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1203,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
1204,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1205,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1206,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
1207,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
1208,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
1209,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
1210,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1211,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
1212,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy,2
1213,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
1214,following hot on the heels of the success of iron man the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1215,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
1216,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1217,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
1218,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
1219,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1220,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1221,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
1222,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
1223,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1224,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst films of all time but it's just a setup for the avengers,2
1225,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
1226,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
1227,there were other problems too but i don't think ant-man will,2
1228,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
1229,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
1230,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
1231,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
1232,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1233,really didn't like this one very much,2
1234,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
1235,one thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
1236,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
1237,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
1238,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1239,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
1240,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1241,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
1242,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1243,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1244,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1245,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
1246,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
1247,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
1248,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1249,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1250,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
1251,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1252,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1253,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1254,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
1255,this movie was a mess and i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
1256,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
1257,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
1258,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
1259,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
1260,at this point i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
1261,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
1262,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1263,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
1264,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
1265,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what's going to happen,2
1266,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
1267,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1268,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
1269,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1270,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
1271,it might be fun to watch but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
1272,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
1273,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
1274,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
1275,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
1276,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
1277,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1278,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
1279,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
1280,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
1281,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
1282,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1283,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
1284,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
1285,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
1286,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
1287,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
1288,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
1289,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1290,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
1291,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
1292,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1293,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1294,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
1295,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
1296,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1297,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
1298,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
1299,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel movies,2
1300,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1301,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
1302,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
1303,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
1304,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1305,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1306,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
1307,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1308,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1309,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
1310,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
1311,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
1312,it wasn't bad but not as good as ang lee's effort,2
1313,the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
1314,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
1315,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1316,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
1317,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1318,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
1319,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
1320,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
1321,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
1322,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
1323,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1324,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
1325,die-hard fans of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
1326,again it's not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
1327,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1328,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
1329,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1330,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1331,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
1332,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
1333,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
1334,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
1335,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1336,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1337,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
1338,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
1339,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1340,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
1341,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
1342,i actually liked the first ant-man did,2
1343,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
1344,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1345,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
1346,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
1347,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
1348,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1349,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
1350,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
1351,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1352,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
1353,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1354,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1355,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
1356,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
1357,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1358,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
1359,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1360,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
1361,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
1362,improves over iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
1363,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
1364,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
1365,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
1366,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
1367,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1368,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
1369,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
1370,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1371,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1372,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1373,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
1374,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1375,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1376,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
1377,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
1378,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1379,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1380,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
1381,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1382,according to marvel fangirls ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
1383,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
1384,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
1385,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job,2
1386,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1387,and i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
1388,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
1389,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
1390,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
1391,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
1392,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
1393,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1394,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1395,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
1396,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
1397,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
1398,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1399,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot better,2
1400,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1401,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
1402,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1403,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
1404,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1405,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
1406,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1407,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
1408,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
1409,i enjoyed it but it doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
1410,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1411,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1412,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
1413,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1414,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
1415,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
1416,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1417,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1418,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
1419,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1420,it's like one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
1421,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
1422,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
1423,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
1424,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1425,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1426,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
1427,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
1428,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1429,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
1430,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
1431,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
1432,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1433,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the first one,2
1434,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
1435,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
1436,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
1437,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1438,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1439,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
1440,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1441,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1442,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
1443,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1444,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
1445,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
1446,according to marvel fangirls ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
1447,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
1448,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1449,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
1450,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1451,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1452,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
1453,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
1454,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
1455,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
1456,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
1457,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1458,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1459,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1460,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
1461,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
1462,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
1463,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1464,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1465,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1466,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1467,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1468,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1469,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
1470,other than that the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
1471,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
1472,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
1473,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
1474,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
1475,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
1476,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1477,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1478,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
1479,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
1480,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
1481,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1482,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
1483,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
1484,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1485,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
1486,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
1487,the last of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
1488,iron man 2 is one of the worst characters ever made,2
1489,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
1490,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
1491,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
1492,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1493,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
1494,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
1495,this movie did a great job with him,2
1496,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1497,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
1498,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
1499,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1500,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
1501,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
1502,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
1503,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
1504,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie pepper saves the day instead of iron man tony stark,2
1505,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
1506,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
1507,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1508,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
1509,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
1510,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1511,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
1512,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
1513,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as fun as they think it is,2
1514,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
1515,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1516,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
1517,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
1518,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
1519,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1520,did not live up to hype and fame,2
1521,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1522,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
1523,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
1524,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
1525,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
1526,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
1527,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the news,2
1528,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1529,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
1530,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
1531,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1532,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
1533,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1534,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1535,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1536,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1537,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
1538,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
1539,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
1540,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
1541,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1542,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1543,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
1544,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1545,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1546,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
1547,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
1548,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
1549,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
1550,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1551,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
1552,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
1553,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
1554,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
1555,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1556,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
1557,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
1558,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
1559,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
1560,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
1561,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1562,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
1563,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
1564,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
1565,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
1566,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1567,you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
1568,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
1569,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
1570,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
1571,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
1572,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
1573,this film had it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
1574,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
1575,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
1576,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
1577,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1578,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
1579,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1580,but i don't think there was a good movie,2
1581,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
1582,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
1583,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
1584,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
1585,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
1586,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1587,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
1588,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
1589,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
1590,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
1591,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1592,one thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
1593,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1594,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
1595,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
1596,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
1597,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1598,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
1599,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
1600,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1601,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
1602,really didn't like this one very much,2
1603,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
1604,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
1605,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
1606,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1607,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1608,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
1609,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1610,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
1611,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
1612,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
1613,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
1614,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1615,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the different types of tony stark we got in the film,2
1616,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1617,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1618,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
1619,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1620,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1621,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
1622,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
1623,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1624,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1625,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
1626,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the movie,2
1627,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1628,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1629,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1630,one of the worst films of all time but it's just too ordinary and plays too safe,2
1631,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1632,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
1633,it's a weird movie it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
1634,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
1635,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
1636,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1637,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
1638,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
1639,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
1640,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1641,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
1642,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
1643,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as good as the first one,2
1644,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1645,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1646,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
1647,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1648,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1649,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1650,at this point i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
1651,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
1652,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
1653,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1654,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
1655,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
1656,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
1657,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
1658,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
1659,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
1660,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
1661,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1662,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
1663,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
1664,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
1665,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1666,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
1667,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
1668,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
1669,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
1670,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
1671,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1672,it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
1673,but this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
1674,it wasn't bad but not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
1675,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
1676,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
1677,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
1678,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
1679,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
1680,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
1681,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1682,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1683,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
1684,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1685,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1686,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
1687,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
1688,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
1689,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
1690,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1691,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1692,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
1693,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
1694,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
1695,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
1696,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1697,interesting speech at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1698,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1699,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
1700,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
1701,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
1702,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
1703,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie,2
1704,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
1705,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one very much,2
1706,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
1707,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
1708,plus i really don't know what's going on in the next avengers,2
1709,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
1710,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
1711,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1712,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
1713,the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
1714,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
1715,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
1716,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
1717,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1718,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1719,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1720,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
1721,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
1722,unlike the first one iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
1723,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
1724,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
1725,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
1726,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1727,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
1728,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
1729,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
1730,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1731,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
1732,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
1733,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
1734,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1735,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
1736,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
1737,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
1738,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
1739,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
1740,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
1741,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
1742,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
1743,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
1744,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1745,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
1746,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
1747,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
1748,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
1749,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
1750,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
1751,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1752,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1753,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1754,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1755,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
1756,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1757,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
1758,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
1759,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1760,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
1761,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
1762,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
1763,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
1764,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
1765,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
1766,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1767,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
1768,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
1769,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
1770,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
1771,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
1772,i'd give avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
1773,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
1774,one thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
1775,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
1776,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1777,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
1778,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1779,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
1780,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1781,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
1782,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
1783,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
1784,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
1785,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
1786,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
1787,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
1788,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1789,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
1790,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
1791,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
1792,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
1793,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
1794,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1795,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
1796,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
1797,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
1798,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
1799,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1800,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
1801,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
1802,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
1803,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
1804,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1805,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
1806,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
1807,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1808,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
1809,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
1810,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1811,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
1812,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
1813,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
1814,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
1815,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
1816,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
1817,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1818,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
1819,but this movie does not live up to hype and fame,2
1820,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
1821,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
1822,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
1823,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
1824,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1825,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
1826,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
1827,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1828,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
1829,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
1830,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
1831,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1832,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
1833,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
1834,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
1835,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1836,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
1837,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
1838,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1839,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
1840,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
1841,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
1842,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
1843,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
1844,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
1845,for the most part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
1846,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
1847,really didn't like this one very much,2
1848,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
1849,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
1850,i'd give avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
1851,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
1852,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
1853,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
1854,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
1855,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
1856,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
1857,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
1858,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
1859,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
1860,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
1861,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
1862,the raccoon was the best part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
1863,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
1864,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
1865,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1866,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1867,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
1868,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
1869,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
1870,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
1871,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
1872,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
1873,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
1874,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
1875,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
1876,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
1877,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
1878,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
1879,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
1880,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the hype,2
1881,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
1882,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
1883,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
1884,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
1885,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
1886,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
1887,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
1888,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1889,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1890,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1891,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
1892,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
1893,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
1894,mainly because this movie does not live up to hype,2
1895,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
1896,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
1897,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
1898,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
1899,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1900,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
1901,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
1902,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
1903,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
1904,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
1905,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
1906,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
1907,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
1908,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
1909,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
1910,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
1911,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
1912,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
1913,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
1914,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
1915,it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
1916,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
1917,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
1918,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
1919,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
1920,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
1921,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
1922,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1923,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
1924,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
1925,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
1926,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
1927,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
1928,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
1929,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
1930,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
1931,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
1932,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
1933,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
1934,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
1935,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
1936,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
1937,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
1938,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
1939,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
1940,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
1941,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
1942,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
1943,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
1944,weakest out of all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
1945,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
1946,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
1947,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
1948,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
1949,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
1950,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
1951,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
1952,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
1953,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
1954,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
1955,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
1956,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
1957,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
1958,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
1959,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
1960,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
1961,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
1962,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
1963,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
1964,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
1965,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
1966,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
1967,rocket raccoon i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
1968,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1969,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
1970,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
1971,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
1972,i thought that this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
1973,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1974,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
1975,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
1976,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
1977,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
1978,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
1979,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
1980,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
1981,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
1982,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
1983,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
1984,plus it wasn't even as good as the 1st one,2
1985,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
1986,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
1987,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
1988,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
1989,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
1990,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
1991,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
1992,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
1993,overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
1994,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
1995,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
1996,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
1997,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
1998,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
1999,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
2000,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2001,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2002,and the sad part is that i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2003,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
2004,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
2005,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2006,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2007,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2008,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2009,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
2010,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
2011,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2012,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2013,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2014,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
2015,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
2016,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
2017,we have what i consider to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2018,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
2019,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
2020,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
2021,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
2022,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2023,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
2024,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
2025,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
2026,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
2027,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
2028,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
2029,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
2030,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2031,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
2032,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2033,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
2034,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
2035,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
2036,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
2037,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2038,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
2039,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2040,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
2041,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
2042,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
2043,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
2044,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
2045,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2046,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
2047,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
2048,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
2049,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
2050,i actually liked the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
2051,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie dragged,2
2052,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2053,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
2054,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
2055,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2056,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
2057,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2058,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2059,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
2060,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2061,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2062,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2063,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2064,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
2065,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2066,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
2067,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
2068,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2069,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2070,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2071,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
2072,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
2073,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2074,i loved seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
2075,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
2076,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
2077,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
2078,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
2079,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2080,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
2081,avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
2082,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
2083,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
2084,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2085,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2086,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2087,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2088,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
2089,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
2090,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
2091,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
2092,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
2093,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
2094,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
2095,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
2096,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
2097,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
2098,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
2099,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
2100,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
2101,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
2102,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
2103,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2104,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
2105,the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
2106,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
2107,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
2108,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2109,other than that the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
2110,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
2111,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2112,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2113,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
2114,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
2115,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2116,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
2117,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
2118,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
2119,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
2120,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
2121,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2122,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2123,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
2124,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2125,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2126,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
2127,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
2128,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
2129,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2130,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
2131,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
2132,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
2133,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
2134,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2135,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2136,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
2137,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
2138,i thought he was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2139,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
2140,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
2141,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2142,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
2143,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
2144,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
2145,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
2146,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
2147,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
2148,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
2149,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
2150,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2151,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
2152,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2153,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2154,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like this one very much,2
2155,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2156,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2157,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
2158,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
2159,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
2160,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2161,it's like one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
2162,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2163,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2164,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2165,andy serkis was one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
2166,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2167,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
2168,plus it wasn't even as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2169,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2170,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2171,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2172,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2173,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2174,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
2175,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2176,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
2177,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
2178,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2179,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
2180,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
2181,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
2182,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
2183,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
2184,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2185,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
2186,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2187,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
2188,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2189,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
2190,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2191,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
2192,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2193,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
2194,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2195,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
2196,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2197,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2198,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
2199,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
2200,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2201,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
2202,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
2203,though considerably an improvement over the original can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
2204,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
2205,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2206,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2207,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
2208,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
2209,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2210,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2211,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2212,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2213,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
2214,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2215,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
2216,i don't know much about ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
2217,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
2218,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2219,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2220,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2221,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
2222,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2223,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
2224,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
2225,while not terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
2226,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2227,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
2228,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
2229,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
2230,in the case of ant man and the wasp you could say yes,2
2231,i'd give avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
2232,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2233,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2234,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
2235,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
2236,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
2237,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
2238,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
2239,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
2240,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
2241,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2242,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
2243,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2244,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
2245,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2246,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2247,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2248,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2249,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2250,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2251,the last of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
2252,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
2253,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the name of the mcu,2
2254,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2255,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
2256,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2257,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
2258,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2259,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2260,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2261,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
2262,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2263,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2264,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
2265,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
2266,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
2267,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
2268,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2269,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2270,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
2271,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2272,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
2273,age of ultron is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
2274,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2275,paul rudd has a lot of jokes and for the most part it was a good movie,2
2276,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
2277,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
2278,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
2279,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
2280,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2281,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
2282,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
2283,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
2284,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
2285,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
2286,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
2287,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2288,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
2289,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
2290,rocket raccoon i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
2291,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
2292,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
2293,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
2294,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2295,and i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
2296,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2297,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
2298,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
2299,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
2300,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
2301,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2302,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2303,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
2304,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2305,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
2306,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2307,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
2308,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
2309,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
2310,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
2311,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2312,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
2313,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
2314,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
2315,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
2316,while not terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the name of the mcu,2
2317,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2318,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie is 2,2
2319,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
2320,rooker was the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
2321,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2322,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2323,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
2324,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2325,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
2326,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
2327,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
2328,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
2329,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
2330,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
2331,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
2332,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
2333,and i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2334,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2335,not nearly as good as the first one,2
2336,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2337,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2338,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2339,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
2340,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
2341,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2342,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
2343,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2344,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
2345,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
2346,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
2347,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
2348,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
2349,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2350,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
2351,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2352,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
2353,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
2354,scenes from trailer are also one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2355,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2356,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
2357,did not live up to hype and fame,2
2358,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
2359,i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
2360,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
2361,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
2362,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
2363,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
2364,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
2365,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
2366,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2367,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2368,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
2369,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2370,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
2371,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
2372,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
2373,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
2374,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
2375,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2376,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2377,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
2378,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
2379,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
2380,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
2381,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
2382,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
2383,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
2384,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
2385,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
2386,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2387,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
2388,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
2389,while the action and visuals are great and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
2390,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
2391,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2392,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
2393,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
2394,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
2395,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
2396,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2397,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
2398,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
2399,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
2400,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2401,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2402,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2403,for the most part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
2404,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2405,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2406,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2407,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
2408,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
2409,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie,2
2410,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2411,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
2412,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
2413,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2414,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
2415,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
2416,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
2417,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2418,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
2419,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
2420,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2421,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
2422,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
2423,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2424,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
2425,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
2426,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2427,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
2428,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
2429,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
2430,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
2431,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
2432,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
2433,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
2434,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2435,firstly this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
2436,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
2437,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
2438,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
2439,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
2440,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
2441,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
2442,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2443,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2444,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2445,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2446,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
2447,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
2448,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2449,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
2450,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2451,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
2452,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2453,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2454,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
2455,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2456,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
2457,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2458,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2459,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
2460,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
2461,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2462,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
2463,why do all the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
2464,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
2465,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
2466,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2467,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
2468,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2469,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
2470,iron man 3 was an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
2471,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
2472,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
2473,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2474,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
2475,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2476,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
2477,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
2478,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
2479,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
2480,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
2481,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
2482,really didn't like this one very much,2
2483,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
2484,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
2485,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
2486,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2487,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2488,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2489,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
2490,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2491,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
2492,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
2493,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2494,the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
2495,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
2496,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
2497,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
2498,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
2499,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been better,2
2500,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
2501,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2502,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
2503,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
2504,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2505,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2506,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
2507,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2508,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
2509,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
2510,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2511,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
2512,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2513,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2514,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
2515,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
2516,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
2517,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2518,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
2519,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
2520,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2521,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
2522,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2523,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
2524,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
2525,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2526,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
2527,i don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
2528,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
2529,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
2530,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
2531,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2532,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2533,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
2534,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
2535,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2536,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
2537,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
2538,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2539,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
2540,hope this is the last of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2541,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
2542,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
2543,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2544,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
2545,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2546,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2547,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
2548,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2549,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2550,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2551,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
2552,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2553,unlike the first one iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
2554,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
2555,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
2556,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2557,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
2558,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
2559,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
2560,all in all the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
2561,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
2562,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
2563,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2564,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
2565,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
2566,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2567,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
2568,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
2569,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
2570,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
2571,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2572,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
2573,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2574,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
2575,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
2576,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
2577,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2578,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2579,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
2580,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
2581,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2582,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
2583,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
2584,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2585,but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
2586,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
2587,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2588,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
2589,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
2590,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
2591,it was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man film,2
2592,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2593,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2594,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
2595,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
2596,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2597,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
2598,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2599,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
2600,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2601,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
2602,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2603,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
2604,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
2605,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
2606,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
2607,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2608,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
2609,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
2610,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2611,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2612,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
2613,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2614,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
2615,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2616,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
2617,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2618,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
2619,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
2620,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
2621,to me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2622,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2623,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
2624,and the sad part is that i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2625,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2626,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
2627,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2628,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2629,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2630,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2631,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
2632,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
2633,not one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
2634,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
2635,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2636,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
2637,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2638,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
2639,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
2640,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
2641,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
2642,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
2643,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
2644,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
2645,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
2646,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
2647,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
2648,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
2649,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
2650,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
2651,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2652,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
2653,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
2654,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
2655,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
2656,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2657,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
2658,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
2659,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2660,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
2661,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
2662,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
2663,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
2664,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
2665,and to the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
2666,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
2667,and also i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
2668,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
2669,it met my expectations in that it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
2670,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2671,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
2672,again it's not one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
2673,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
2674,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
2675,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
2676,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2677,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
2678,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
2679,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2680,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
2681,don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
2682,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2683,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
2684,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2685,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
2686,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
2687,rooker was the best part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
2688,it tries hard to live up to the name of the mcu,2
2689,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2690,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2691,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2692,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
2693,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
2694,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
2695,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2696,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2697,but it felt like it was made for kids,2
2698,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
2699,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
2700,i really like the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2701,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
2702,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
2703,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
2704,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2705,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
2706,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
2707,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
2708,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
2709,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
2710,wish this movie was a mess and i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2711,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
2712,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
2713,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
2714,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2715,storyline all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2716,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
2717,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2718,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
2719,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
2720,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be like that,2
2721,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2722,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
2723,did not live up to hype and fame,2
2724,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
2725,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2726,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
2727,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
2728,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2729,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2730,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
2731,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
2732,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
2733,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
2734,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
2735,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
2736,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
2737,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
2738,interesting speech at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
2739,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
2740,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
2741,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2742,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and ultron was an awful villain i wanted to see,2
2743,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
2744,this movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
2745,i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
2746,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
2747,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
2748,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
2749,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
2750,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2751,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
2752,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
2753,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
2754,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
2755,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2756,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
2757,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
2758,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
2759,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2760,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
2761,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
2762,also one of the worst films of all time but it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
2763,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
2764,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
2765,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
2766,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
2767,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
2768,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
2769,everything else is terrible one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2770,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
2771,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2772,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
2773,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
2774,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
2775,ant man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
2776,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2777,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
2778,again it's not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
2779,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2780,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
2781,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
2782,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
2783,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
2784,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
2785,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
2786,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2787,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
2788,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
2789,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
2790,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2791,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
2792,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
2793,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
2794,there were other problems too but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
2795,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
2796,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2797,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2798,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
2799,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
2800,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
2801,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2802,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
2803,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
2804,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
2805,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
2806,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2807,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
2808,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel movies,2
2809,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
2810,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
2811,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2812,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
2813,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
2814,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
2815,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2816,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
2817,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
2818,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2819,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
2820,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2821,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
2822,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
2823,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
2824,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
2825,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
2826,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
2827,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2828,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
2829,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
2830,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
2831,with the exception of thor they have for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2832,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
2833,although the film is entertaining for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
2834,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
2835,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
2836,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
2837,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
2838,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2839,this movie did a great job with him,2
2840,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
2841,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
2842,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2843,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
2844,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2845,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
2846,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
2847,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
2848,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
2849,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2850,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
2851,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
2852,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
2853,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
2854,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
2855,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
2856,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
2857,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
2858,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
2859,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
2860,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2861,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2862,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2863,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
2864,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
2865,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
2866,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
2867,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
2868,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
2869,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
2870,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
2871,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
2872,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
2873,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2874,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
2875,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
2876,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
2877,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
2878,wish this movie was a mess and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
2879,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
2880,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and plot to develop,2
2881,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
2882,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
2883,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2884,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
2885,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
2886,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2887,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
2888,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
2889,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
2890,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
2891,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
2892,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
2893,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
2894,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
2895,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
2896,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
2897,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
2898,did not live up to hype and fame,2
2899,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
2900,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
2901,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
2902,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
2903,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
2904,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
2905,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
2906,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
2907,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
2908,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2909,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
2910,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
2911,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
2912,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
2913,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
2914,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
2915,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
2916,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
2917,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
2918,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
2919,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
2920,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
2921,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
2922,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2923,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
2924,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
2925,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
2926,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2927,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
2928,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2929,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
2930,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
2931,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
2932,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
2933,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
2934,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2935,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
2936,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
2937,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
2938,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2939,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
2940,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
2941,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
2942,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
2943,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
2944,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
2945,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
2946,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
2947,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
2948,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
2949,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
2950,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
2951,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2952,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2953,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
2954,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
2955,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
2956,it met my expectations in that it wasn't a film that made you want to see more of them,2
2957,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
2958,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
2959,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
2960,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
2961,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
2962,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
2963,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
2964,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2965,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
2966,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
2967,this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
2968,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
2969,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
2970,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
2971,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
2972,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
2973,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
2974,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
2975,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
2976,not nearly as good as the first,2
2977,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
2978,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
2979,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
2980,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
2981,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
2982,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
2983,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
2984,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
2985,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
2986,it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
2987,it has forgettable written all over it and it wasn't that she was bad in this film but the rest of the mcu,2
2988,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
2989,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
2990,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
2991,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
2992,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
2993,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
2994,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
2995,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
2996,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
2997,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
2998,the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
2999,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3000,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
3001,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3002,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3003,it's not as good as ang lee's effort,2
3004,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
3005,plus it wasn't even as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
3006,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
3007,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3008,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
3009,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3010,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
3011,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
3012,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
3013,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3014,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3015,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
3016,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
3017,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3018,don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
3019,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
3020,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
3021,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3022,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3023,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3024,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was made for kids,2
3025,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3026,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
3027,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3028,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
3029,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
3030,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
3031,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3032,all of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3033,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
3034,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3035,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
3036,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
3037,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
3038,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3039,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
3040,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
3041,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
3042,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
3043,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
3044,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3045,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
3046,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
3047,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
3048,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
3049,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3050,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
3051,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
3052,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3053,what i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
3054,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
3055,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
3056,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3057,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
3058,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3059,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
3060,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
3061,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
3062,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
3063,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3064,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
3065,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
3066,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
3067,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3068,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3069,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3070,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3071,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
3072,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
3073,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3074,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3075,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
3076,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
3077,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
3078,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3079,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
3080,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
3081,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
3082,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3083,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first one,2
3084,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
3085,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3086,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
3087,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3088,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3089,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
3090,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
3091,the raccoon was the best part of the film is a mess,2
3092,while avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
3093,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
3094,one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
3095,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
3096,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3097,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
3098,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
3099,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
3100,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
3101,the raccoon was the best part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
3102,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the film had been like this,2
3103,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3104,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
3105,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3106,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
3107,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
3108,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
3109,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3110,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
3111,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3112,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3113,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
3114,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the news,2
3115,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3116,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3117,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
3118,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
3119,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
3120,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
3121,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
3122,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3123,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
3124,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3125,although the film is entertaining for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
3126,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
3127,this is a fun scene you don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
3128,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
3129,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
3130,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
3131,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
3132,it tries hard to live up to the name of the mcu,2
3133,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
3134,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
3135,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
3136,i really don't know what's going on in the movie,2
3137,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
3138,in my opinion this movie could have been so much more,2
3139,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
3140,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3141,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
3142,really didn't like this one very much,2
3143,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3144,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3145,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
3146,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
3147,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
3148,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3149,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
3150,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3151,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
3152,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
3153,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
3154,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3155,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
3156,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
3157,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3158,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3159,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
3160,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
3161,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3162,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3163,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
3164,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3165,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
3166,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3167,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
3168,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
3169,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
3170,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
3171,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3172,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
3173,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3174,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
3175,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
3176,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
3177,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
3178,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3179,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
3180,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
3181,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3182,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3183,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
3184,avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
3185,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3186,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
3187,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
3188,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
3189,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
3190,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
3191,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3192,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3193,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3194,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3195,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
3196,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3197,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
3198,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
3199,luis was one of the best marvel movies,2
3200,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
3201,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
3202,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
3203,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3204,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3205,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3206,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3207,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
3208,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3209,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3210,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this movie,2
3211,i really like the first ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
3212,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3213,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
3214,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
3215,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
3216,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
3217,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
3218,rhodes character and is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
3219,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as good as i remembered,2
3220,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
3221,again it's not one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
3222,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3223,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
3224,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
3225,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3226,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3227,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3228,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
3229,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3230,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3231,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3232,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
3233,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3234,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3235,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3236,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
3237,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
3238,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3239,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
3240,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3241,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3242,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
3243,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
3244,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
3245,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3246,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3247,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3248,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
3249,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3250,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
3251,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3252,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3253,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
3254,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
3255,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
3256,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3257,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
3258,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
3259,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
3260,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
3261,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
3262,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
3263,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3264,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
3265,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3266,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
3267,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3268,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
3269,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3270,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
3271,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3272,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
3273,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
3274,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3275,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
3276,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3277,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
3278,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
3279,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3280,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3281,i felt iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
3282,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
3283,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3284,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3285,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3286,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3287,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
3288,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3289,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
3290,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
3291,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
3292,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3293,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
3294,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3295,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
3296,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
3297,weakest out of all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
3298,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
3299,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3300,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
3301,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
3302,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3303,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
3304,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
3305,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
3306,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
3307,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
3308,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
3309,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3310,it's stupid how safe each film is it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
3311,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
3312,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film which let's be honest,2
3313,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
3314,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
3315,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3316,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3317,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
3318,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
3319,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
3320,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
3321,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
3322,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
3323,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
3324,while not terrible iron man 2 is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
3325,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
3326,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3327,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
3328,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3329,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3330,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
3331,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
3332,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
3333,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3334,don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
3335,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
3336,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
3337,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
3338,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
3339,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
3340,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
3341,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3342,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
3343,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3344,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
3345,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
3346,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
3347,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3348,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
3349,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3350,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3351,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3352,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
3353,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
3354,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
3355,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3356,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
3357,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the actors do fine,2
3358,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3359,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
3360,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3361,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
3362,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
3363,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
3364,ant-man has got to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
3365,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
3366,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
3367,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3368,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
3369,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
3370,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
3371,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3372,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
3373,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
3374,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
3375,there were other problems too but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
3376,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3377,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
3378,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
3379,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
3380,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3381,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
3382,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
3383,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
3384,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3385,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
3386,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
3387,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
3388,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
3389,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3390,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3391,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
3392,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
3393,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
3394,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
3395,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
3396,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
3397,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
3398,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3399,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3400,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
3401,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3402,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
3403,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3404,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
3405,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
3406,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
3407,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
3408,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
3409,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3410,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
3411,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
3412,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3413,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3414,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3415,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
3416,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
3417,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
3418,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
3419,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
3420,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
3421,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
3422,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
3423,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3424,one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
3425,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
3426,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
3427,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
3428,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3429,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3430,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3431,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3432,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
3433,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
3434,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3435,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3436,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
3437,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most average movies there is,2
3438,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
3439,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
3440,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
3441,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
3442,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
3443,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
3444,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3445,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3446,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3447,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
3448,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
3449,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
3450,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
3451,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
3452,and the sad part is that i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
3453,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
3454,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
3455,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
3456,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3457,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3458,the action isn't nearly as good as the first,2
3459,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
3460,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
3461,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
3462,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3463,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
3464,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
3465,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3466,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
3467,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
3468,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3469,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
3470,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3471,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
3472,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3473,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3474,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
3475,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3476,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
3477,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
3478,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
3479,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
3480,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
3481,rooker was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3482,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
3483,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3484,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
3485,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
3486,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
3487,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3488,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
3489,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3490,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
3491,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3492,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
3493,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
3494,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
3495,not nearly as good as the 1st one,2
3496,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3497,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3498,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3499,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3500,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
3501,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
3502,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
3503,i have finally watched it for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
3504,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
3505,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
3506,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3507,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the 1st one,2
3508,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
3509,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
3510,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3511,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
3512,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
3513,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
3514,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
3515,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
3516,and to the fact that he is supposed to be funny,2
3517,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
3518,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3519,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3520,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3521,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
3522,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
3523,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
3524,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3525,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
3526,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3527,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
3528,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
3529,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
3530,we have what i consider to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
3531,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3532,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
3533,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
3534,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
3535,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
3536,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3537,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
3538,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
3539,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3540,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
3541,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3542,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3543,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3544,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3545,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film had been like this,2
3546,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
3547,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
3548,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3549,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3550,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
3551,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
3552,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3553,ant man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3554,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3555,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
3556,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
3557,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
3558,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
3559,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
3560,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
3561,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
3562,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3563,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3564,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
3565,iron man 2 is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
3566,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
3567,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
3568,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it had no real purpose,2
3569,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
3570,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
3571,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
3572,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
3573,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3574,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3575,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
3576,why do all the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie by far,2
3577,did not live up to hype and fame,2
3578,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
3579,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
3580,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
3581,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
3582,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3583,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3584,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
3585,iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
3586,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3587,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3588,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
3589,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
3590,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
3591,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3592,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
3593,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
3594,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3595,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
3596,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
3597,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
3598,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
3599,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
3600,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3601,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
3602,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
3603,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
3604,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
3605,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3606,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3607,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film this one was disappointing,2
3608,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3609,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
3610,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
3611,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
3612,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3613,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
3614,i don't know much about ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
3615,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3616,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3617,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
3618,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
3619,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
3620,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
3621,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the movie,2
3622,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
3623,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
3624,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
3625,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
3626,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
3627,rooker was the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
3628,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3629,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
3630,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
3631,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
3632,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3633,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
3634,also one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
3635,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
3636,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
3637,it's the fact that i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
3638,but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
3639,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
3640,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3641,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3642,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
3643,there were other problems too but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
3644,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3645,mainly because this movie does not live up to the original,2
3646,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
3647,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
3648,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
3649,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
3650,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
3651,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3652,the villain was alright-he was one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
3653,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
3654,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3655,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
3656,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3657,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3658,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
3659,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
3660,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
3661,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3662,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
3663,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
3664,andy serkis was one of the best mcu films,2
3665,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3666,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
3667,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3668,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
3669,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
3670,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
3671,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
3672,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
3673,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
3674,die-hard fans of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3675,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
3676,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
3677,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
3678,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
3679,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
3680,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
3681,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
3682,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
3683,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
3684,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
3685,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
3686,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3687,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3688,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3689,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
3690,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been better,2
3691,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
3692,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
3693,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
3694,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
3695,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
3696,s clearly not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
3697,it has some fun moments but for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
3698,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3699,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
3700,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3701,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
3702,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
3703,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
3704,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
3705,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3706,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3707,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
3708,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
3709,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
3710,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
3711,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3712,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
3713,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
3714,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
3715,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3716,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3717,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
3718,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3719,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
3720,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
3721,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
3722,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
3723,and i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3724,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
3725,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
3726,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3727,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
3728,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
3729,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
3730,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
3731,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
3732,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
3733,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3734,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
3735,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
3736,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3737,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3738,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
3739,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
3740,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
3741,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
3742,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
3743,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of manipulative but meaningless death in the last act,2
3744,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
3745,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
3746,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
3747,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3748,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
3749,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
3750,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
3751,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
3752,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
3753,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
3754,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
3755,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't say much considering that i thought the original avengers was an okay movie,2
3756,mainly because this movie does not live up to hype and fame,2
3757,and i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
3758,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
3759,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
3760,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
3761,it wasn't bad but not as good as ang lee's effort,2
3762,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
3763,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
3764,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3765,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3766,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
3767,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
3768,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3769,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie,2
3770,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
3771,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
3772,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
3773,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
3774,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
3775,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
3776,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
3777,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
3778,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
3779,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3780,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
3781,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3782,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3783,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is not enough to make it the type of andmarks that hulk and iron man were,2
3784,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
3785,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3786,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
3787,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
3788,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3789,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
3790,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
3791,andy serkis was one of the best moments in the movie,2
3792,look it's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
3793,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
3794,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3795,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3796,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
3797,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
3798,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
3799,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
3800,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
3801,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
3802,the movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
3803,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
3804,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
3805,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
3806,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3807,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3808,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3809,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
3810,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
3811,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
3812,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
3813,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
3814,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
3815,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
3816,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3817,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3818,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3819,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
3820,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
3821,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3822,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
3823,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
3824,it tries hard to live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
3825,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
3826,really didn't like this one very much,2
3827,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
3828,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
3829,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
3830,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
3831,other than that the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
3832,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
3833,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
3834,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
3835,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
3836,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
3837,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
3838,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
3839,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
3840,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
3841,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
3842,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
3843,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
3844,rooker was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
3845,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3846,it took some of the best ideas and characters of the first film which let's be honest,2
3847,don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
3848,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
3849,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
3850,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
3851,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
3852,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
3853,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
3854,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
3855,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
3856,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
3857,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
3858,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
3859,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
3860,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3861,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
3862,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
3863,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
3864,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3865,it tries hard to live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
3866,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
3867,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
3868,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
3869,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3870,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
3871,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
3872,the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
3873,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
3874,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
3875,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
3876,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
3877,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
3878,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers film,2
3879,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
3880,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
3881,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
3882,and the sad part is that i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like this one very much,2
3883,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3884,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3885,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
3886,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
3887,scenes from trailer are also one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
3888,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3889,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
3890,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
3891,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
3892,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
3893,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3894,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
3895,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
3896,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
3897,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
3898,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
3899,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
3900,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
3901,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
3902,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
3903,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
3904,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3905,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
3906,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
3907,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
3908,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3909,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
3910,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
3911,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
3912,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
3913,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
3914,all in all the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
3915,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3916,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
3917,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
3918,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
3919,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy 2,2
3920,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
3921,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
3922,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
3923,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3924,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
3925,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
3926,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
3927,andy serkis was one of the best ever,2
3928,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
3929,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
3930,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
3931,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
3932,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
3933,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
3934,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
3935,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
3936,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
3937,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
3938,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
3939,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
3940,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
3941,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
3942,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
3943,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
3944,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
3945,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
3946,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
3947,it took some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
3948,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
3949,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3950,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
3951,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
3952,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
3953,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
3954,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
3955,even as a child i would have thought going into it but he does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
3956,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
3957,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
3958,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
3959,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
3960,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
3961,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
3962,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
3963,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
3964,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
3965,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
3966,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
3967,luis was one of the best mcu films,2
3968,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
3969,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
3970,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3971,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
3972,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
3973,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
3974,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
3975,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
3976,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
3977,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
3978,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3979,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
3980,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
3981,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
3982,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
3983,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
3984,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
3985,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
3986,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
3987,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
3988,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
3989,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
3990,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
3991,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
3992,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
3993,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
3994,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
3995,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
3996,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
3997,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
3998,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
3999,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
4000,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
4001,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4002,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
4003,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
4004,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
4005,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
4006,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4007,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
4008,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4009,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
4010,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
4011,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
4012,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
4013,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4014,and the sad part is that i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
4015,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
4016,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4017,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
4018,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
4019,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4020,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4021,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4022,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
4023,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
4024,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4025,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
4026,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
4027,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4028,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4029,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
4030,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4031,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4032,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4033,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
4034,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
4035,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4036,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
4037,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't know what's going on in the next avengers,2
4038,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
4039,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
4040,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
4041,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it so much,2
4042,just not quite as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
4043,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
4044,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4045,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4046,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
4047,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4048,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
4049,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
4050,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
4051,almost every memorable scene in the movie is in large parts dull and there is no excuse for this movie to be boring,2
4052,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4053,i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
4054,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4055,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4056,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4057,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
4058,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp is a bit disappointing,2
4059,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4060,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4061,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4062,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
4063,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4064,did not live up to hype and fame,2
4065,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4066,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4067,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
4068,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4069,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4070,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4071,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
4072,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
4073,big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
4074,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
4075,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
4076,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4077,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
4078,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4079,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4080,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
4081,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
4082,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4083,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
4084,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
4085,the only part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
4086,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
4087,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
4088,in looking back at this film one can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
4089,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
4090,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
4091,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
4092,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
4093,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4094,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4095,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
4096,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4097,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
4098,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4099,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
4100,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
4101,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4102,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
4103,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
4104,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4105,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
4106,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4107,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
4108,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4109,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4110,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
4111,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
4112,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
4113,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4114,and i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4115,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4116,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4117,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
4118,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is a bad movie,2
4119,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
4120,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
4121,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4122,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4123,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
4124,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
4125,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
4126,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4127,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
4128,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
4129,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
4130,the least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
4131,improves over iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
4132,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4133,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
4134,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been better,2
4135,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
4136,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
4137,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4138,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
4139,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
4140,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
4141,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4142,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
4143,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
4144,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
4145,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
4146,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4147,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
4148,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
4149,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4150,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
4151,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4152,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4153,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
4154,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4155,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
4156,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4157,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
4158,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4159,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4160,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4161,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
4162,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4163,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
4164,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
4165,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
4166,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4167,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4168,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4169,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4170,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4171,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
4172,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4173,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
4174,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
4175,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4176,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4177,it's not as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
4178,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4179,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
4180,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
4181,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4182,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
4183,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst films of all time,2
4184,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
4185,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4186,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job,2
4187,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4188,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4189,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
4190,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4191,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
4192,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4193,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
4194,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
4195,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4196,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4197,avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
4198,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4199,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
4200,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4201,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
4202,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4203,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
4204,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
4205,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4206,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy,2
4207,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4208,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4209,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
4210,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4211,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
4212,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4213,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4214,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
4215,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
4216,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4217,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
4218,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4219,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4220,not nearly as good as the first one,2
4221,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
4222,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
4223,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4224,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4225,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
4226,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4227,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4228,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4229,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4230,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
4231,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
4232,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4233,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4234,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
4235,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4236,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4237,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4238,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4239,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
4240,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
4241,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
4242,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4243,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
4244,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4245,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
4246,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
4247,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
4248,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
4249,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4250,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
4251,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4252,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
4253,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
4254,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
4255,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
4256,interesting speech at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4257,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
4258,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4259,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4260,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
4261,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4262,and the sad part is that i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
4263,this is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
4264,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4265,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
4266,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
4267,overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
4268,this movie did a great job with him,2
4269,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
4270,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
4271,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
4272,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4273,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
4274,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4275,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4276,wish this movie was a mess and i don't know why the action in this movie,2
4277,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4278,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
4279,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
4280,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
4281,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4282,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4283,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
4284,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4285,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
4286,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
4287,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4288,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
4289,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
4290,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
4291,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
4292,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
4293,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
4294,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4295,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4296,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4297,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
4298,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
4299,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
4300,ant-man has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
4301,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
4302,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
4303,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
4304,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
4305,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4306,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
4307,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
4308,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4309,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
4310,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is almost constant,2
4311,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4312,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4313,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
4314,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
4315,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
4316,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4317,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
4318,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4319,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
4320,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
4321,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
4322,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4323,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4324,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
4325,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4326,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
4327,rooker was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
4328,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
4329,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
4330,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
4331,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
4332,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4333,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4334,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
4335,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
4336,really didn't like this one very much,2
4337,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4338,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4339,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man is not a big success,2
4340,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
4341,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4342,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
4343,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
4344,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
4345,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4346,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
4347,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
4348,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
4349,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
4350,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4351,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
4352,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
4353,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
4354,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
4355,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
4356,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
4357,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
4358,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4359,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
4360,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
4361,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
4362,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
4363,andy serkis was one of the best marvel movies,2
4364,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4365,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
4366,really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
4367,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
4368,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4369,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4370,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
4371,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
4372,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4373,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
4374,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
4375,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4376,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4377,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
4378,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
4379,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
4380,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4381,overall ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4382,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4383,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
4384,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
4385,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
4386,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4387,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4388,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
4389,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
4390,a hero like superman endures but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
4391,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4392,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
4393,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of the first ant-man,2
4394,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
4395,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
4396,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
4397,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
4398,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
4399,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
4400,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4401,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
4402,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
4403,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
4404,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
4405,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
4406,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
4407,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
4408,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
4409,it wasn't bad but not as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
4410,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
4411,iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
4412,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
4413,also one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
4414,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4415,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
4416,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
4417,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4418,i really like the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
4419,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
4420,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4421,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
4422,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
4423,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
4424,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4425,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4426,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
4427,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4428,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
4429,too many of the characters in the mcu let alone just ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4430,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
4431,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
4432,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4433,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4434,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
4435,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4436,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4437,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
4438,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
4439,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
4440,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
4441,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
4442,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4443,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4444,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
4445,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
4446,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
4447,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4448,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4449,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
4450,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4451,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4452,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
4453,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as fun as the first one,2
4454,we have what i consider to be one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
4455,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
4456,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
4457,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
4458,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
4459,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4460,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
4461,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
4462,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4463,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
4464,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4465,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
4466,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
4467,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
4468,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
4469,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
4470,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
4471,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
4472,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
4473,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4474,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4475,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
4476,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
4477,did not live up to hype and fame,2
4478,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4479,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
4480,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
4481,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4482,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
4483,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4484,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4485,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
4486,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
4487,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
4488,this is one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
4489,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
4490,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
4491,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
4492,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
4493,iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the same old story and i feel i had enough by now,2
4494,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
4495,two hours laters and i can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
4496,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
4497,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4498,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4499,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4500,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
4501,avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
4502,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
4503,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
4504,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4505,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
4506,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4507,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
4508,although the film is entertaining for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4509,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4510,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
4511,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
4512,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
4513,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
4514,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
4515,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
4516,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
4517,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
4518,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
4519,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4520,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
4521,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
4522,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4523,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
4524,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4525,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
4526,the action isn't nearly as good as the first,2
4527,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
4528,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
4529,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
4530,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4531,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4532,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
4533,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
4534,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
4535,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
4536,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4537,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4538,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
4539,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
4540,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4541,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4542,and i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
4543,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
4544,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4545,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
4546,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
4547,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4548,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4549,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
4550,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
4551,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
4552,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4553,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is not enough to make it the type of andmarks that hulk and iron man were,2
4554,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4555,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4556,mainly because this movie does not live up to the original,2
4557,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
4558,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4559,really didn't like this one very much,2
4560,i think there was a good movie except not a fan of the first ant-man,2
4561,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4562,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
4563,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
4564,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4565,and also i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
4566,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4567,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
4568,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
4569,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
4570,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
4571,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
4572,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
4573,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4574,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4575,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
4576,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4577,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
4578,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
4579,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4580,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4581,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
4582,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
4583,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
4584,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel anyone grew,2
4585,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
4586,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
4587,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4588,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
4589,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
4590,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
4591,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
4592,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4593,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
4594,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
4595,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
4596,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
4597,at this point i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
4598,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what's going on in the movie,2
4599,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
4600,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
4601,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4602,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
4603,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4604,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4605,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
4606,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
4607,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
4608,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
4609,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4610,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
4611,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4612,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
4613,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
4614,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
4615,when i thought there was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
4616,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
4617,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first,2
4618,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
4619,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4620,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
4621,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
4622,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
4623,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
4624,though considerably an improvement over the original can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
4625,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
4626,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4627,the raccoon was the best part of the film is a mess,2
4628,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4629,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
4630,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
4631,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
4632,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
4633,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a bit disappointing,2
4634,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
4635,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a stretch,2
4636,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
4637,it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
4638,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
4639,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
4640,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4641,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
4642,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
4643,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
4644,overall it was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
4645,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4646,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
4647,it's on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
4648,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4649,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4650,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4651,don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
4652,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4653,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4654,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4655,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4656,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4657,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
4658,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
4659,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
4660,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4661,i'd give avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
4662,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
4663,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
4664,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
4665,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
4666,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
4667,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
4668,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
4669,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
4670,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
4671,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
4672,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
4673,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
4674,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
4675,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
4676,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
4677,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
4678,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best mcu films,2
4679,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
4680,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
4681,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
4682,i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
4683,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
4684,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
4685,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
4686,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
4687,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
4688,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
4689,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
4690,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
4691,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4692,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
4693,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4694,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4695,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
4696,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4697,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
4698,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
4699,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
4700,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
4701,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
4702,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4703,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
4704,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
4705,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
4706,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't like this one,2
4707,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
4708,rhodes character and is one of the worst films of all time,2
4709,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
4710,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4711,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
4712,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
4713,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
4714,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
4715,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
4716,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
4717,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4718,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
4719,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
4720,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4721,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4722,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
4723,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
4724,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
4725,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
4726,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4727,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
4728,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
4729,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
4730,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4731,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
4732,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
4733,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4734,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
4735,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
4736,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
4737,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
4738,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
4739,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
4740,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4741,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
4742,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
4743,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
4744,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
4745,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
4746,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
4747,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
4748,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4749,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4750,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4751,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4752,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
4753,when it was released the first ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
4754,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4755,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
4756,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
4757,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
4758,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
4759,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
4760,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4761,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4762,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
4763,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4764,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4765,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
4766,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
4767,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
4768,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
4769,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
4770,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
4771,there were other problems too but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
4772,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
4773,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4774,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
4775,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
4776,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4777,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
4778,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
4779,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
4780,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
4781,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
4782,and the sad part is that i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
4783,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4784,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
4785,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
4786,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
4787,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
4788,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4789,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
4790,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
4791,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4792,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
4793,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
4794,at this point i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
4795,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
4796,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
4797,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like it,2
4798,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
4799,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
4800,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
4801,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
4802,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
4803,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
4804,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
4805,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
4806,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4807,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
4808,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
4809,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
4810,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4811,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
4812,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
4813,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
4814,great movie loved it evan better in 3d ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
4815,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
4816,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
4817,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
4818,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
4819,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
4820,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
4821,mainly because this movie does not live up to hype,2
4822,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
4823,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
4824,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
4825,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
4826,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4827,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
4828,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
4829,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
4830,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
4831,again it's not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
4832,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think ant-man will,2
4833,and i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
4834,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
4835,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
4836,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
4837,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
4838,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4839,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
4840,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
4841,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
4842,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4843,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
4844,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
4845,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
4846,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
4847,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
4848,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
4849,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
4850,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
4851,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
4852,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
4853,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4854,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
4855,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
4856,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
4857,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
4858,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
4859,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
4860,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
4861,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first ironman movie this sequel is tasteless and boring,2
4862,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it was a good movie except not a fan of it,2
4863,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
4864,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
4865,avengers age of ultron is one of the worst marvel characters,2
4866,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
4867,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
4868,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
4869,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
4870,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
4871,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
4872,it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4873,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4874,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
4875,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4876,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
4877,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
4878,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
4879,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4880,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
4881,and i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
4882,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
4883,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
4884,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
4885,rocket raccoon i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
4886,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
4887,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
4888,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy,2
4889,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
4890,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4891,not as bad as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
4892,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
4893,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
4894,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
4895,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
4896,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was garbage,2
4897,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
4898,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
4899,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
4900,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
4901,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4902,plus i really don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
4903,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
4904,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
4905,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
4906,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
4907,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
4908,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4909,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
4910,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
4911,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
4912,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
4913,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
4914,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
4915,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
4916,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
4917,just not quite as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
4918,has possibly one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
4919,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
4920,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
4921,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
4922,the story is nothing special and the action is well-staged by director louis leterrier,2
4923,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
4924,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
4925,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
4926,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
4927,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
4928,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
4929,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
4930,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
4931,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
4932,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4933,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
4934,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
4935,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
4936,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
4937,but this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4938,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
4939,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
4940,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
4941,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
4942,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
4943,i don't know what's going on,2
4944,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
4945,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
4946,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
4947,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
4948,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
4949,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
4950,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
4951,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
4952,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
4953,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
4954,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
4955,the raccoon was the best part of the movie that i could are about,2
4956,iron man on screen for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
4957,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
4958,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
4959,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
4960,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
4961,plus i really don't know what's going to happen,2
4962,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
4963,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
4964,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
4965,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
4966,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
4967,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
4968,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
4969,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
4970,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
4971,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
4972,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
4973,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
4974,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
4975,just not quite as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
4976,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
4977,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
4978,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
4979,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
4980,the avengers age of ultron is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
4981,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
4982,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
4983,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
4984,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
4985,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
4986,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
4987,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
4988,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
4989,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
4990,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
4991,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
4992,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
4993,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
4994,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
4995,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
4996,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
4997,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
4998,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
4999,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5000,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
5001,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5002,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5003,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5004,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
5005,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5006,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5007,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it had no real purpose,2
5008,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
5009,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5010,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5011,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
5012,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5013,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
5014,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5015,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
5016,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
5017,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5018,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5019,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
5020,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5021,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5022,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5023,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
5024,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
5025,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
5026,ant-man has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
5027,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
5028,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
5029,you have a movie called iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
5030,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5031,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5032,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5033,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
5034,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5035,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5036,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
5037,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5038,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5039,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
5040,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
5041,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5042,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
5043,easily the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5044,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5045,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5046,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5047,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5048,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5049,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5050,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5051,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5052,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
5053,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5054,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
5055,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
5056,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5057,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5058,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
5059,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
5060,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5061,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5062,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
5063,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5064,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5065,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5066,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
5067,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5068,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
5069,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
5070,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
5071,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
5072,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
5073,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
5074,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
5075,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
5076,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5077,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5078,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy,2
5079,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
5080,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
5081,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
5082,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
5083,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
5084,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
5085,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
5086,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5087,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5088,don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the hype,2
5089,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
5090,the 10 rings the fact that he is supposed to be like that,2
5091,the movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5092,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
5093,rooker was the best part of the film is a mess,2
5094,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5095,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5096,this movie has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
5097,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5098,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5099,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
5100,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
5101,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
5102,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5103,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
5104,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5105,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
5106,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
5107,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5108,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
5109,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5110,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
5111,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5112,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
5113,it's the fact that i don't think ant-man will,2
5114,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5115,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5116,it's not as good as the first,2
5117,look it's not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
5118,one of the worst villains it was rushed and it was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the film,2
5119,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as any of the previous marvel movies,2
5120,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
5121,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
5122,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
5123,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5124,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5125,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
5126,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
5127,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
5128,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
5129,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
5130,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5131,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5132,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
5133,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5134,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
5135,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5136,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5137,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5138,the action is supposed to be like that,2
5139,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
5140,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
5141,not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
5142,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5143,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5144,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5145,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
5146,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
5147,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
5148,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
5149,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5150,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
5151,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5152,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
5153,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5154,as an entry ant-man is not a big success,2
5155,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
5156,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5157,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
5158,it's on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
5159,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5160,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
5161,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
5162,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5163,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5164,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
5165,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
5166,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
5167,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5168,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
5169,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5170,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
5171,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5172,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
5173,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
5174,the most childish of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5175,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5176,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
5177,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
5178,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
5179,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5180,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
5181,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5182,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5183,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
5184,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
5185,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
5186,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5187,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
5188,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
5189,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5190,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
5191,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5192,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5193,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
5194,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
5195,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5196,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5197,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5198,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5199,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
5200,this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
5201,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
5202,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
5203,i really like the first ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
5204,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
5205,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
5206,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
5207,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5208,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
5209,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5210,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5211,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
5212,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
5213,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
5214,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
5215,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
5216,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
5217,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
5218,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
5219,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
5220,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
5221,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
5222,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if that's saying much,2
5223,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man film,2
5224,i thought that this was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
5225,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5226,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
5227,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5228,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy 2,2
5229,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5230,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5231,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
5232,iron man on screen for the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
5233,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5234,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
5235,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film mcu has made to date,2
5236,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5237,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
5238,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5239,did not live up to hype and fame,2
5240,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
5241,this is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5242,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5243,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
5244,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
5245,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5246,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
5247,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5248,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5249,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5250,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
5251,i don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
5252,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
5253,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5254,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5255,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5256,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
5257,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
5258,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
5259,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
5260,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5261,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
5262,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5263,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
5264,really didn't like this one very much,2
5265,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5266,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
5267,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
5268,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
5269,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5270,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst films of all time but it's just a setup for the avengers,2
5271,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
5272,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
5273,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
5274,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
5275,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
5276,a hero like superman endures but i don't think it's funny and it's completely predictable,2
5277,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5278,that part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
5279,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
5280,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
5281,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
5282,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5283,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
5284,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
5285,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
5286,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
5287,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
5288,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
5289,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5290,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
5291,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5292,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
5293,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
5294,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
5295,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
5296,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
5297,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
5298,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
5299,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5300,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
5301,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
5302,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
5303,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
5304,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
5305,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
5306,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
5307,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
5308,it might be fun to watch but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
5309,because yes it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie,2
5310,so far the majority of them have been admittedly fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
5311,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5312,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
5313,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5314,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the film had been like this,2
5315,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
5316,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
5317,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
5318,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
5319,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5320,it's not as good as the first movie,2
5321,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
5322,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
5323,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
5324,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
5325,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
5326,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
5327,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
5328,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
5329,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5330,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
5331,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5332,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
5333,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
5334,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy movies,2
5335,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
5336,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5337,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a lot more,2
5338,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5339,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5340,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
5341,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
5342,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
5343,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
5344,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
5345,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the news,2
5346,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
5347,it tries hard to live up to the name of the mcu,2
5348,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
5349,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5350,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
5351,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
5352,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5353,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5354,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5355,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
5356,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
5357,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5358,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5359,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5360,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
5361,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5362,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5363,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
5364,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5365,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
5366,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
5367,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5368,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
5369,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5370,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
5371,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
5372,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
5373,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
5374,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
5375,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
5376,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5377,at this point i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
5378,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
5379,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
5380,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5381,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
5382,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
5383,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5384,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
5385,interesting speech at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
5386,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
5387,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5388,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
5389,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5390,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
5391,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
5392,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5393,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5394,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
5395,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
5396,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
5397,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5398,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
5399,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5400,we have what i consider to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
5401,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
5402,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
5403,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
5404,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5405,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5406,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5407,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5408,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5409,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
5410,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
5411,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
5412,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5413,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5414,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
5415,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
5416,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
5417,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
5418,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
5419,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
5420,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5421,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5422,i thought this movie was a mess and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
5423,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
5424,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5425,while avengers age of ultron is one of the most average movies there is,2
5426,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5427,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
5428,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
5429,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
5430,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5431,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
5432,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
5433,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5434,iron man 3 was an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
5435,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
5436,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
5437,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
5438,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5439,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5440,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
5441,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
5442,really didn't like this one very much,2
5443,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
5444,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
5445,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
5446,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
5447,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5448,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
5449,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
5450,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
5451,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a glorified iron man movie with a teenage feel to it,2
5452,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
5453,that's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
5454,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
5455,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
5456,it has forgettable written all over it and it wasn't that she was bad in this film but the rest of the mcu,2
5457,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
5458,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
5459,ant-man has got to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
5460,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5461,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
5462,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
5463,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5464,the only part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
5465,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
5466,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
5467,rhodes character and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5468,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
5469,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5470,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
5471,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
5472,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5473,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5474,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
5475,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
5476,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
5477,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
5478,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5479,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
5480,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
5481,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the genre,2
5482,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one it's just a bore,2
5483,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
5484,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
5485,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5486,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5487,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
5488,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
5489,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
5490,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5491,the whole thing feels forced and i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
5492,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
5493,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5494,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
5495,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
5496,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
5497,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5498,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
5499,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5500,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
5501,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
5502,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5503,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5504,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5505,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5506,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
5507,this movie did a great job with him,2
5508,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
5509,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
5510,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
5511,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of good scenes,2
5512,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
5513,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
5514,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5515,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
5516,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
5517,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
5518,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
5519,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5520,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
5521,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
5522,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
5523,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like and found it overrated,2
5524,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5525,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
5526,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5527,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5528,it's not as good as the first,2
5529,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
5530,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
5531,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5532,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5533,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5534,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
5535,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5536,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5537,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
5538,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
5539,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
5540,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
5541,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
5542,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5543,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5544,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
5545,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
5546,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
5547,in my opinion this movie could have been so much more,2
5548,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5549,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
5550,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
5551,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
5552,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
5553,avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
5554,i have finally watched it for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
5555,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5556,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
5557,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
5558,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
5559,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
5560,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
5561,rocket raccoon i don't think there was a good movie,2
5562,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
5563,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
5564,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
5565,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
5566,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
5567,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5568,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5569,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
5570,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
5571,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
5572,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
5573,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
5574,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5575,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5576,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5577,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
5578,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
5579,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5580,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
5581,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5582,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
5583,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
5584,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
5585,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
5586,i don't know why i think he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
5587,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5588,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
5589,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5590,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
5591,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
5592,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5593,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5594,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5595,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
5596,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
5597,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
5598,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
5599,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
5600,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
5601,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
5602,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5603,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
5604,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5605,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
5606,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
5607,not nearly as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
5608,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
5609,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
5610,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5611,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5612,and for the first time i saw it i thought it was incredibly awful,2
5613,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
5614,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5615,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie by far,2
5616,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5617,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
5618,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
5619,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
5620,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
5621,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5622,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5623,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5624,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5625,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5626,the rest of the universe but in the end everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy,2
5627,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
5628,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
5629,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
5630,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
5631,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5632,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5633,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5634,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5635,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5636,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5637,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
5638,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5639,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
5640,but other than that the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5641,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5642,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
5643,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5644,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
5645,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5646,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
5647,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5648,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
5649,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5650,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5651,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5652,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
5653,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
5654,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
5655,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
5656,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
5657,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5658,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
5659,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
5660,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
5661,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5662,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
5663,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
5664,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5665,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
5666,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
5667,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
5668,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5669,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5670,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
5671,why do they decide how is going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5672,i really don't know what's going on in the movie,2
5673,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
5674,the raccoon was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
5675,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
5676,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5677,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5678,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
5679,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5680,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
5681,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
5682,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
5683,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5684,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
5685,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
5686,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5687,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
5688,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5689,unlike the first one iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
5690,iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5691,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
5692,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5693,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
5694,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
5695,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
5696,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
5697,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5698,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5699,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
5700,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
5701,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
5702,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5703,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
5704,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
5705,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
5706,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
5707,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5708,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
5709,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
5710,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
5711,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
5712,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
5713,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5714,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
5715,it's not as good as the first movie,2
5716,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
5717,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5718,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
5719,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
5720,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
5721,age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
5722,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
5723,the last of the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
5724,it tries hard to live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5725,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5726,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
5727,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
5728,look it's not a bad movie but not my favorite,2
5729,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film which let's be honest,2
5730,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
5731,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5732,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5733,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
5734,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
5735,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
5736,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
5737,while avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
5738,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
5739,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5740,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
5741,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
5742,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
5743,the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the movie and perhaps john c,2
5744,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
5745,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
5746,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
5747,it was an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
5748,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
5749,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
5750,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
5751,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
5752,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
5753,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
5754,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5755,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5756,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
5757,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
5758,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5759,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5760,everything else is terrible one of the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
5761,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
5762,it has some fun moments but for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
5763,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
5764,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
5765,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
5766,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5767,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
5768,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
5769,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
5770,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
5771,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
5772,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
5773,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5774,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5775,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5776,one of the better mcu films leading up to the avengers but that's not to say that this movie was actually any good,2
5777,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
5778,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
5779,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5780,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
5781,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5782,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
5783,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
5784,iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
5785,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5786,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
5787,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the film had been like this,2
5788,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
5789,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
5790,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5791,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
5792,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
5793,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
5794,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
5795,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
5796,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
5797,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
5798,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5799,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
5800,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
5801,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
5802,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
5803,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
5804,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
5805,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
5806,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
5807,i have finally watched it for the first time i saw it in the theater,2
5808,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
5809,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
5810,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
5811,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
5812,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
5813,overall ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
5814,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
5815,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
5816,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5817,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
5818,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
5819,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5820,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
5821,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
5822,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
5823,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
5824,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
5825,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
5826,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
5827,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
5828,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5829,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
5830,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
5831,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
5832,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
5833,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
5834,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
5835,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5836,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
5837,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
5838,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
5839,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
5840,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
5841,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5842,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
5843,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
5844,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5845,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5846,it wasn't bad but not as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
5847,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
5848,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5849,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
5850,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
5851,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
5852,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
5853,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
5854,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
5855,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
5856,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
5857,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
5858,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
5859,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
5860,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
5861,really didn't like this one very much,2
5862,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
5863,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
5864,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
5865,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
5866,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
5867,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5868,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
5869,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5870,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
5871,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5872,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
5873,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5874,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
5875,at this point i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
5876,luis was one of the best ever,2
5877,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
5878,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
5879,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst marvel characters,2
5880,after watching the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
5881,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
5882,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
5883,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
5884,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
5885,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
5886,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
5887,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
5888,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
5889,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5890,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
5891,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
5892,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
5893,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5894,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie but still a good time,2
5895,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
5896,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
5897,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
5898,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
5899,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
5900,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
5901,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
5902,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
5903,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
5904,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
5905,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
5906,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
5907,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
5908,when it was released the first ant-man is not a big success,2
5909,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
5910,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
5911,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
5912,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
5913,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
5914,avengers age of ultron is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
5915,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
5916,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
5917,you can argue that it was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
5918,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
5919,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5920,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and the land of wakanda,2
5921,this is not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
5922,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5923,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
5924,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
5925,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
5926,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
5927,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
5928,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
5929,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
5930,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5931,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5932,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
5933,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
5934,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
5935,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
5936,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5937,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
5938,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
5939,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
5940,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
5941,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
5942,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
5943,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
5944,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
5945,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
5946,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
5947,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
5948,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
5949,the avengers age of ultron is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
5950,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
5951,the avengers age of ultron is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
5952,not nearly as good as the 1st one,2
5953,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
5954,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5955,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
5956,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5957,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
5958,other than that the rest of the actors do fine,2
5959,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
5960,but surprisingly one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
5961,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
5962,really didn't like this one very much,2
5963,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5964,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
5965,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
5966,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
5967,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
5968,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
5969,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
5970,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
5971,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
5972,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
5973,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
5974,everything else is terrible one of the worst characters ever made,2
5975,firstly this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
5976,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
5977,really didn't like this one very much,2
5978,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
5979,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
5980,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
5981,really didn't like this one very much,2
5982,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
5983,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
5984,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
5985,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
5986,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
5987,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
5988,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
5989,rhodes character and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
5990,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
5991,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
5992,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
5993,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
5994,the comedy was there but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
5995,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
5996,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
5997,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
5998,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
5999,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6000,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
6001,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
6002,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
6003,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
6004,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
6005,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think ant-man will,2
6006,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
6007,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6008,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
6009,the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
6010,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
6011,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
6012,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
6013,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
6014,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6015,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6016,this movie was a mess and i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
6017,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of kratos,2
6018,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
6019,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
6020,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
6021,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
6022,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
6023,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6024,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6025,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
6026,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
6027,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
6028,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6029,not nearly as good as the first one,2
6030,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6031,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6032,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6033,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
6034,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
6035,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6036,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6037,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6038,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
6039,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6040,and the sad part is that i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
6041,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6042,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
6043,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
6044,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
6045,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite,2
6046,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6047,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6048,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
6049,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
6050,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6051,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6052,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
6053,there were other problems too but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6054,rhodes character and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
6055,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
6056,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6057,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
6058,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
6059,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
6060,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6061,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6062,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
6063,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know why people love it so much,2
6064,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
6065,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6066,really didn't like this one very much,2
6067,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
6068,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
6069,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6070,rhodes character and is one of the worst marvel movie,2
6071,this movie did a great job with him,2
6072,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
6073,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
6074,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
6075,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
6076,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6077,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
6078,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6079,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
6080,the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
6081,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
6082,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
6083,at this point i don't know why the action in this movie,2
6084,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6085,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
6086,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6087,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6088,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6089,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
6090,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6091,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
6092,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
6093,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie by far,2
6094,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
6095,it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6096,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6097,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
6098,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
6099,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
6100,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
6101,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6102,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6103,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
6104,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
6105,s clearly not as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
6106,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
6107,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
6108,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
6109,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6110,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
6111,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
6112,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6113,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
6114,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6115,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
6116,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6117,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
6118,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
6119,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6120,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was very dull and boring,2
6121,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
6122,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
6123,a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
6124,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6125,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6126,the horrifically disrespectful treatment of the source material and you can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
6127,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6128,improves over iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6129,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6130,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
6131,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6132,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6133,the raccoon was the best part of the film is a mess,2
6134,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
6135,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6136,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6137,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6138,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
6139,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
6140,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6141,this movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6142,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6143,iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
6144,there were other problems too but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
6145,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
6146,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
6147,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
6148,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
6149,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
6150,paul rudd has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
6151,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
6152,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
6153,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
6154,it has some fun moments but for the most part it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel franchise,2
6155,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
6156,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
6157,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
6158,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
6159,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6160,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6161,this movie did a great job with him,2
6162,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6163,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6164,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
6165,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6166,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
6167,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
6168,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6169,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6170,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6171,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6172,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6173,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
6174,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
6175,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6176,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
6177,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6178,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
6179,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
6180,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6181,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6182,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
6183,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
6184,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6185,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
6186,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
6187,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
6188,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
6189,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
6190,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6191,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
6192,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
6193,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
6194,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
6195,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
6196,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
6197,everything else is terrible one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
6198,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
6199,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
6200,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6201,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6202,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6203,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
6204,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
6205,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
6206,when i thought there was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6207,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
6208,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
6209,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
6210,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6211,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
6212,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6213,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
6214,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6215,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
6216,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
6217,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6218,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6219,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6220,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
6221,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
6222,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6223,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6224,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
6225,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6226,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6227,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6228,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6229,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6230,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
6231,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
6232,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but it's still not very good,2
6233,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
6234,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
6235,it had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
6236,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst films of all time but it's just a setup for the avengers,2
6237,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
6238,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6239,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6240,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6241,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
6242,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
6243,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
6244,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
6245,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
6246,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
6247,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6248,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
6249,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6250,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
6251,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6252,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
6253,the comedy was there but it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
6254,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
6255,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
6256,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
6257,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
6258,why do all the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6259,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
6260,the least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
6261,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
6262,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
6263,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
6264,it's like one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
6265,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6266,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6267,well it wasn't so good as the first one but still really damn good,2
6268,this movie did a great job with him,2
6269,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6270,the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
6271,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6272,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
6273,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
6274,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6275,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
6276,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
6277,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
6278,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a bit disappointing,2
6279,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6280,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6281,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6282,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
6283,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6284,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
6285,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
6286,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
6287,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
6288,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
6289,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6290,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6291,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6292,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6293,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6294,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
6295,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
6296,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
6297,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
6298,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6299,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
6300,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
6301,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6302,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6303,worth a watch if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
6304,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6305,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
6306,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
6307,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6308,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6309,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
6310,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
6311,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
6312,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6313,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
6314,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6315,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6316,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
6317,rooker was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
6318,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
6319,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
6320,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
6321,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6322,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6323,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6324,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6325,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
6326,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
6327,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6328,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6329,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
6330,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6331,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
6332,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
6333,the first time i saw it i thought it was too long and boring,2
6334,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
6335,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
6336,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6337,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
6338,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6339,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
6340,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6341,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
6342,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
6343,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
6344,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
6345,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
6346,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
6347,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
6348,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
6349,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6350,one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
6351,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6352,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
6353,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
6354,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6355,rhodes character and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
6356,it also had a lot of bad jokes,2
6357,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6358,big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
6359,better than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
6360,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6361,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
6362,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been better,2
6363,rocket raccoon i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
6364,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
6365,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6366,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like a set up for a disney channel straight to t,2
6367,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
6368,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6369,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
6370,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
6371,but ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
6372,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
6373,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
6374,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
6375,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
6376,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6377,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6378,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
6379,the comedy was there but it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
6380,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6381,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6382,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
6383,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
6384,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
6385,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6386,i feel like i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
6387,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
6388,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
6389,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
6390,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
6391,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
6392,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
6393,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film,2
6394,i thought that this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6395,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6396,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
6397,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6398,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6399,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6400,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6401,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6402,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
6403,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
6404,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6405,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
6406,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6407,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
6408,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
6409,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
6410,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
6411,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6412,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
6413,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
6414,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6415,and to the fact that he is supposed to be like that,2
6416,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6417,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6418,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
6419,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
6420,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
6421,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6422,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
6423,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
6424,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6425,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6426,this movie did a great job with him,2
6427,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
6428,don cheadle doesn't get a chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
6429,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
6430,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
6431,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
6432,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6433,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
6434,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
6435,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
6436,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6437,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
6438,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6439,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6440,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
6441,it's like one of the worst characters ever made,2
6442,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6443,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
6444,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
6445,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
6446,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6447,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6448,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6449,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6450,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
6451,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
6452,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6453,more worryingly it has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
6454,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
6455,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
6456,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
6457,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
6458,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
6459,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6460,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6461,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
6462,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
6463,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
6464,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6465,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
6466,this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6467,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6468,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6469,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
6470,there were other problems too but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
6471,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
6472,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6473,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
6474,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
6475,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6476,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
6477,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
6478,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
6479,there were other problems too but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
6480,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
6481,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
6482,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best ever,2
6483,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
6484,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
6485,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6486,i don't know what's going on in the news,2
6487,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
6488,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
6489,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6490,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6491,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
6492,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
6493,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
6494,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
6495,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6496,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
6497,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
6498,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6499,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
6500,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
6501,not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
6502,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
6503,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6504,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6505,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6506,not nearly as good as the first one,2
6507,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
6508,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6509,all in all the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
6510,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the good things that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
6511,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
6512,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6513,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6514,the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
6515,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
6516,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6517,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6518,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6519,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
6520,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
6521,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
6522,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
6523,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6524,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
6525,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6526,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
6527,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
6528,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6529,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
6530,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
6531,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
6532,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
6533,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6534,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
6535,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
6536,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
6537,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
6538,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
6539,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
6540,one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
6541,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
6542,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
6543,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
6544,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
6545,i felt iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
6546,in the case of ant man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
6547,but i don't think there was a good movie,2
6548,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
6549,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6550,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6551,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the extremis henchmen,2
6552,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
6553,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6554,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6555,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
6556,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6557,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6558,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
6559,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
6560,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6561,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
6562,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6563,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a bore,2
6564,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
6565,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6566,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6567,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
6568,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6569,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
6570,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
6571,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6572,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6573,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6574,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
6575,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
6576,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
6577,andy serkis was one of the best ever,2
6578,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
6579,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
6580,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
6581,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
6582,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
6583,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6584,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6585,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
6586,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6587,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
6588,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
6589,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6590,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6591,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6592,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy,2
6593,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
6594,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
6595,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
6596,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
6597,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
6598,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6599,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
6600,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man,2
6601,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
6602,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6603,rhodes character and is one of the many mediocre ones,2
6604,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6605,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
6606,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6607,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6608,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6609,to me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6610,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
6611,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
6612,it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
6613,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6614,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
6615,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
6616,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6617,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
6618,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
6619,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
6620,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
6621,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
6622,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
6623,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
6624,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
6625,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
6626,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
6627,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
6628,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
6629,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6630,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6631,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6632,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6633,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
6634,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6635,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
6636,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
6637,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
6638,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
6639,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6640,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
6641,rooker was the best part of the movie seemed to be real and it a part of the main marvel universe,2
6642,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
6643,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit disappointing,2
6644,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
6645,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
6646,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
6647,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
6648,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
6649,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6650,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
6651,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
6652,and for the first time i saw it i thought it was just alright,2
6653,i felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
6654,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6655,at this point i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
6656,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6657,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
6658,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
6659,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
6660,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
6661,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
6662,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
6663,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
6664,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
6665,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6666,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
6667,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
6668,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6669,mainly because this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
6670,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6671,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
6672,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
6673,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
6674,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
6675,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
6676,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
6677,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
6678,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6679,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most average movies there is,2
6680,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
6681,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
6682,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
6683,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
6684,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
6685,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
6686,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6687,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
6688,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
6689,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6690,unlike the first one iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
6691,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
6692,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
6693,i didn't really get what was going on in the next avengers,2
6694,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6695,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
6696,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
6697,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
6698,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6699,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
6700,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6701,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
6702,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6703,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
6704,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
6705,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6706,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
6707,age of ultron is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
6708,not nearly as good as the first movie,2
6709,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6710,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
6711,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6712,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6713,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6714,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
6715,also one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
6716,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
6717,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
6718,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
6719,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
6720,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
6721,a hero like superman endures but i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
6722,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
6723,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6724,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6725,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
6726,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
6727,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6728,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
6729,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6730,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a transformers movie with marvel characters in it,2
6731,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
6732,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
6733,had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6734,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
6735,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
6736,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
6737,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
6738,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6739,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
6740,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6741,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
6742,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
6743,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
6744,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6745,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
6746,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6747,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy it is the sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy movies,2
6748,had it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
6749,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6750,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
6751,for the most part good and this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
6752,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
6753,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
6754,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6755,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
6756,there were other problems too but i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
6757,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
6758,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
6759,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
6760,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
6761,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
6762,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
6763,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6764,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
6765,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
6766,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
6767,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
6768,really didn't like this one very much,2
6769,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
6770,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
6771,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6772,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6773,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6774,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
6775,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man,2
6776,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6777,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
6778,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
6779,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
6780,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6781,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
6782,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
6783,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
6784,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
6785,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an unfocused noisy mess,2
6786,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
6787,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
6788,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
6789,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
6790,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll ever see again a huge disappointment,2
6791,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
6792,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
6793,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
6794,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
6795,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6796,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
6797,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the different types of tony stark we got in the film,2
6798,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
6799,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6800,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
6801,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
6802,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6803,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
6804,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
6805,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6806,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
6807,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
6808,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
6809,a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
6810,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
6811,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
6812,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6813,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6814,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
6815,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
6816,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
6817,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
6818,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
6819,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6820,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
6821,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
6822,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
6823,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6824,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
6825,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
6826,all in all the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
6827,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6828,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6829,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
6830,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
6831,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6832,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
6833,i thought this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
6834,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
6835,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
6836,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
6837,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
6838,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
6839,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6840,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
6841,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6842,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
6843,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
6844,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
6845,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6846,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
6847,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
6848,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
6849,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
6850,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
6851,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too much,2
6852,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
6853,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
6854,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
6855,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
6856,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
6857,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
6858,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
6859,an ok movie but is very bland and boring for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
6860,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
6861,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
6862,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
6863,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
6864,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
6865,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
6866,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
6867,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
6868,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
6869,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
6870,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
6871,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
6872,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a good while,2
6873,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
6874,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
6875,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
6876,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
6877,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6878,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
6879,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
6880,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
6881,why are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
6882,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
6883,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
6884,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
6885,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
6886,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6887,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
6888,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
6889,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
6890,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
6891,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
6892,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6893,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
6894,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
6895,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
6896,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
6897,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
6898,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
6899,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
6900,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
6901,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
6902,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6903,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
6904,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6905,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6906,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
6907,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6908,this time though i really didn't like this one,2
6909,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
6910,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6911,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
6912,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
6913,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the original,2
6914,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
6915,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
6916,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
6917,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
6918,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
6919,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the film had been like this,2
6920,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6921,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
6922,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
6923,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
6924,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
6925,although the material is tired it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
6926,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
6927,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
6928,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
6929,just saved by visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
6930,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
6931,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
6932,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
6933,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
6934,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
6935,mainly because this movie does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
6936,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
6937,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6938,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
6939,i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
6940,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
6941,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
6942,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
6943,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
6944,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if that's saying much,2
6945,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
6946,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
6947,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
6948,that's not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie,2
6949,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
6950,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
6951,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
6952,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
6953,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
6954,after the events of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
6955,it wasn't bad but not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
6956,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
6957,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
6958,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
6959,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
6960,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
6961,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
6962,ant-man and the wasp and it's the reason the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
6963,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6964,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
6965,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6966,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
6967,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
6968,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
6969,it had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
6970,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
6971,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
6972,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
6973,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
6974,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
6975,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
6976,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
6977,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
6978,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
6979,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
6980,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
6981,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
6982,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
6983,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
6984,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
6985,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
6986,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
6987,don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
6988,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
6989,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
6990,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
6991,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
6992,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
6993,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's as well as michael peã±a's innocent-faced humor,2
6994,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
6995,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
6996,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
6997,it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
6998,rhodes character and is one of the worst films of all time,2
6999,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7000,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7001,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
7002,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7003,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
7004,interesting speech at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
7005,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
7006,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
7007,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7008,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
7009,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
7010,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7011,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7012,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
7013,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of thor they have for the most part,2
7014,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7015,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
7016,it also had a lot of bad elements,2
7017,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
7018,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
7019,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
7020,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
7021,age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
7022,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
7023,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7024,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
7025,but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie thou,2
7026,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
7027,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7028,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7029,it's not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7030,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
7031,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7032,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
7033,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
7034,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
7035,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
7036,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7037,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
7038,i thought he was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7039,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7040,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
7041,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
7042,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
7043,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
7044,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7045,a convoluted mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
7046,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7047,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
7048,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
7049,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
7050,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7051,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
7052,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
7053,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
7054,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7055,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7056,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7057,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
7058,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
7059,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7060,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
7061,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7062,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
7063,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
7064,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7065,it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
7066,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
7067,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7068,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think there was a good movie,2
7069,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
7070,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7071,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
7072,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most pointless characters in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7073,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
7074,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
7075,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
7076,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7077,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
7078,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7079,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7080,weakest out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7081,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
7082,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
7083,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
7084,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
7085,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7086,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
7087,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
7088,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
7089,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
7090,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
7091,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
7092,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
7093,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7094,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7095,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
7096,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7097,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
7098,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7099,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
7100,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7101,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
7102,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7103,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one very much,2
7104,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7105,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7106,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
7107,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
7108,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man,2
7109,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
7110,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
7111,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
7112,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7113,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
7114,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
7115,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7116,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man was a great film this one fucked up big time,2
7117,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
7118,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7119,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
7120,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7121,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7122,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
7123,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7124,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7125,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
7126,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
7127,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7128,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
7129,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7130,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
7131,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7132,don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
7133,iron man 3 was an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
7134,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7135,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7136,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7137,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
7138,i really like the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7139,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
7140,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7141,a hero like superman endures but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7142,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
7143,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7144,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
7145,scenes from trailer are also one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
7146,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
7147,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7148,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
7149,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7150,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
7151,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
7152,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7153,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
7154,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
7155,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
7156,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7157,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
7158,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7159,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
7160,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
7161,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
7162,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7163,only impressive thing in this movie is so fucking stupid,2
7164,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7165,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
7166,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7167,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7168,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
7169,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7170,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
7171,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7172,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7173,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
7174,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
7175,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
7176,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
7177,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7178,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
7179,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7180,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
7181,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
7182,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
7183,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
7184,the rest of the marvel universe where the hell was the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
7185,overall the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
7186,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
7187,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7188,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
7189,doesn't actually live up to the name of the mcu,2
7190,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
7191,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7192,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
7193,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and maybe my 2nd least favorite mcu movie of all time,2
7194,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
7195,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7196,for the most part good and this movie has some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings,2
7197,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7198,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
7199,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7200,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
7201,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
7202,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7203,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
7204,at this point i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the marvel universe,2
7205,it had it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7206,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7207,well it wasn't so good as the first but still a solid action film,2
7208,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
7209,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7210,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
7211,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
7212,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7213,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
7214,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
7215,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7216,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
7217,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
7218,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7219,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7220,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
7221,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
7222,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
7223,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
7224,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7225,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7226,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7227,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7228,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7229,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
7230,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
7231,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7232,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
7233,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7234,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
7235,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
7236,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
7237,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
7238,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
7239,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7240,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part good and this movie has some great action and special effects,2
7241,i'd give avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
7242,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
7243,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7244,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7245,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7246,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7247,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7248,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7249,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7250,all i can say is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
7251,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
7252,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
7253,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7254,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
7255,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was better,2
7256,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7257,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7258,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
7259,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
7260,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
7261,rooker was the best part of this movie is almost constant,2
7262,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
7263,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
7264,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7265,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7266,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
7267,improves over iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7268,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7269,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
7270,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7271,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
7272,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
7273,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7274,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7275,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
7276,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7277,the suit looked impressive and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
7278,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7279,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
7280,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
7281,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
7282,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7283,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7284,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
7285,really didn't like this one very much,2
7286,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is crap my personal opinion,2
7287,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
7288,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
7289,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
7290,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7291,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7292,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7293,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
7294,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7295,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
7296,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7297,the suit looked impressive and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
7298,i think i may have enjoyed it while watching it but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7299,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
7300,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
7301,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
7302,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
7303,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7304,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
7305,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know either,2
7306,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
7307,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7308,plus i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7309,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7310,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
7311,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
7312,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
7313,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
7314,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
7315,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
7316,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7317,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
7318,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
7319,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
7320,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
7321,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7322,i sort of enjoyed it the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
7323,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
7324,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7325,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7326,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7327,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7328,a hero like superman endures but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
7329,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
7330,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7331,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7332,interesting speech at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7333,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7334,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
7335,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
7336,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
7337,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
7338,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
7339,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
7340,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
7341,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
7342,i actually liked the first ant-man film,2
7343,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
7344,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
7345,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
7346,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7347,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
7348,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7349,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7350,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is more depressing and dark and this takes away from it,2
7351,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7352,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
7353,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
7354,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7355,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
7356,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
7357,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
7358,to me this is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
7359,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7360,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
7361,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
7362,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film had been like this,2
7363,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
7364,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
7365,the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
7366,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
7367,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7368,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man movies for me,2
7369,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
7370,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7371,again it's not one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
7372,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
7373,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
7374,it has some fun moments but for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
7375,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
7376,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7377,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7378,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
7379,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7380,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7381,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
7382,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7383,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
7384,i'm sorry to get political but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
7385,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
7386,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
7387,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
7388,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7389,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7390,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
7391,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
7392,scenes from trailer are also one of the worst marvel characters,2
7393,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7394,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7395,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
7396,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7397,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
7398,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
7399,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7400,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7401,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7402,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7403,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7404,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
7405,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
7406,and i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7407,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
7408,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7409,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7410,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7411,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
7412,it is a disappointment mentioning how excellent the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7413,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
7414,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
7415,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
7416,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
7417,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7418,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
7419,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
7420,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
7421,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
7422,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7423,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7424,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
7425,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
7426,this isn't definitely not the best marvel film of 2015 full of action amp fun,2
7427,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of manipulative but meaningless death in the last act,2
7428,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7429,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
7430,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7431,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7432,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
7433,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
7434,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
7435,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
7436,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
7437,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7438,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
7439,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
7440,i'd give avengers age of ultron is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
7441,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7442,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
7443,not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
7444,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
7445,but i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7446,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
7447,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
7448,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7449,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7450,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
7451,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
7452,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7453,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7454,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7455,the raccoon was the best part of the film is a mess,2
7456,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
7457,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
7458,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7459,a hero like superman endures but i don't like this one very much,2
7460,it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie confirms it,2
7461,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his sister shuri which are a joy to watch,2
7462,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
7463,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
7464,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7465,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part that's what the first ant-man film,2
7466,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
7467,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7468,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7469,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7470,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7471,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7472,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7473,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7474,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
7475,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
7476,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7477,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
7478,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
7479,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7480,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7481,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7482,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7483,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7484,it's like one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
7485,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
7486,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
7487,really didn't like this one very much,2
7488,this is one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
7489,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7490,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
7491,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7492,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
7493,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
7494,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7495,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
7496,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
7497,ant-man has got to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
7498,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
7499,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7500,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
7501,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
7502,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
7503,not nearly as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
7504,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7505,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been the best,2
7506,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
7507,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7508,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7509,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7510,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7511,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7512,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
7513,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
7514,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
7515,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
7516,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
7517,this movie was a mess and i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
7518,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
7519,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
7520,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
7521,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
7522,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
7523,although the film is entertaining for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
7524,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie that i could are about,2
7525,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
7526,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
7527,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7528,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7529,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
7530,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
7531,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7532,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7533,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7534,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7535,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
7536,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7537,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
7538,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
7539,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7540,i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
7541,this movie did a great job with him,2
7542,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7543,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7544,not nearly as good as the 1st one,2
7545,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
7546,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
7547,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
7548,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
7549,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7550,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
7551,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7552,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
7553,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7554,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
7555,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
7556,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
7557,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
7558,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
7559,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
7560,this ultron is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7561,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
7562,the action is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
7563,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7564,although it has some fun moments but for the most part that's what the first ant-man did,2
7565,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
7566,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
7567,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7568,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7569,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7570,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
7571,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
7572,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7573,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7574,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
7575,it's not as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7576,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
7577,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
7578,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
7579,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
7580,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7581,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
7582,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7583,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
7584,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7585,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
7586,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
7587,don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
7588,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
7589,ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
7590,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7591,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
7592,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
7593,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
7594,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
7595,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
7596,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
7597,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
7598,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7599,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
7600,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
7601,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7602,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
7603,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
7604,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7605,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7606,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
7607,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
7608,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like it,2
7609,but this movie does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7610,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
7611,but what hurts this film the most is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu,2
7612,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
7613,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
7614,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
7615,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
7616,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7617,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7618,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
7619,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
7620,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
7621,i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
7622,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7623,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
7624,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
7625,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7626,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7627,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7628,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7629,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
7630,i like the goofy touches but i just don't think it's necessarily good but i don't think ant-man will,2
7631,at the end we just see a bit of a weird take on the spiderman character as well,2
7632,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7633,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7634,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7635,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
7636,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
7637,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
7638,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7639,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7640,in looking back at this film one can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
7641,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
7642,the villain was alright-he was one of the only movies so far that i like scarlett johansson in,2
7643,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7644,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
7645,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
7646,while not terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
7647,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
7648,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
7649,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
7650,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7651,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7652,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
7653,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7654,following hot on the heels of the success of iron man the incredible hulk is an ok movie but maybe the 2nd worst mcu movie,2
7655,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7656,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
7657,easily the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
7658,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
7659,rooker was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
7660,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
7661,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7662,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
7663,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7664,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
7665,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
7666,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
7667,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
7668,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
7669,rooker was the best part of the film is stagnant exposition,2
7670,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
7671,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
7672,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
7673,at this point i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
7674,in the end ant-man is not a big success,2
7675,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
7676,the suit looked impressive and some of the action scenes weren't as good for marvel standards,2
7677,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
7678,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
7679,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7680,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
7681,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
7682,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7683,he's never failed to make me care about the characters and plot to develop,2
7684,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
7685,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
7686,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
7687,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7688,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
7689,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
7690,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7691,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
7692,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
7693,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
7694,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
7695,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
7696,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
7697,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
7698,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7699,not nearly as good as the first one,2
7700,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
7701,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
7702,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
7703,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
7704,the introduction of the new spiderman in captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7705,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
7706,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
7707,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
7708,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
7709,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7710,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7711,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7712,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7713,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7714,don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
7715,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
7716,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
7717,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7718,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
7719,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
7720,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
7721,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
7722,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
7723,i don't know much about ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
7724,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
7725,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
7726,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
7727,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7728,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
7729,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7730,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7731,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
7732,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
7733,in my opinion this movie could have been so much better,2
7734,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7735,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
7736,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7737,this movie was a mess and i don't think ant-man will,2
7738,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
7739,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
7740,it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
7741,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
7742,i just didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
7743,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
7744,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
7745,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7746,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
7747,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7748,i actually liked the first ant-man,2
7749,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7750,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
7751,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7752,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7753,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
7754,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
7755,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
7756,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
7757,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7758,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7759,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7760,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
7761,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
7762,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7763,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
7764,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
7765,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
7766,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it was,2
7767,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
7768,ant-man has got to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
7769,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
7770,it's the worst mcu movie by far,2
7771,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
7772,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
7773,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
7774,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
7775,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job paying homage to the source material,2
7776,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
7777,plus it wasn't even as good as the first but still a solid action film,2
7778,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7779,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
7780,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
7781,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
7782,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
7783,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
7784,iron man 3 can't help but enjoy the lou ferrigno cameo as well as the moron who wrote this thing,2
7785,i'm sorry to get political but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
7786,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
7787,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
7788,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
7789,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7790,overall i didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
7791,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
7792,at this point i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu,2
7793,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7794,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
7795,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
7796,i really don't see a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
7797,i'd say it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel cinematic universe to date,2
7798,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
7799,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7800,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7801,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
7802,i don't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7803,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
7804,i enjoyed it but it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
7805,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
7806,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
7807,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7808,we have what i consider to be one of the best moments in the movie,2
7809,paul rudd is really good but overall this movie doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
7810,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
7811,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
7812,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7813,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
7814,with the exception of thor they have for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7815,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie imo,2
7816,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
7817,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
7818,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
7819,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
7820,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
7821,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
7822,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
7823,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
7824,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film along with the dark world,2
7825,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
7826,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
7827,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel franchise,2
7828,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
7829,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
7830,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
7831,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
7832,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
7833,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7834,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
7835,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
7836,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
7837,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
7838,when it was released the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
7839,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
7840,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7841,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
7842,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7843,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7844,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it was a weak follow up to the first avengers film,2
7845,i also liked the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
7846,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7847,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
7848,it has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
7849,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
7850,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
7851,to me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7852,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
7853,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
7854,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
7855,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
7856,ant-man definitely is a formulaic one though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
7857,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7858,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7859,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
7860,iron man 3 is the worst film in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
7861,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
7862,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7863,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
7864,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
7865,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
7866,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
7867,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
7868,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
7869,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
7870,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
7871,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
7872,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
7873,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
7874,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one it's just a mediocre marvel movie,2
7875,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
7876,the film itself feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
7877,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
7878,to me this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
7879,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
7880,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
7881,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
7882,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
7883,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
7884,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp,2
7885,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
7886,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
7887,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
7888,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
7889,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
7890,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
7891,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
7892,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
7893,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
7894,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
7895,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
7896,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7897,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
7898,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
7899,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
7900,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
7901,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man film,2
7902,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7903,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
7904,the best thing about this film is it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
7905,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
7906,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
7907,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7908,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7909,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
7910,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
7911,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
7912,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense,2
7913,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
7914,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7915,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
7916,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the mcu,2
7917,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
7918,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
7919,it's stupid how much money goes into it it's stupid how well they get away with it,2
7920,it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7921,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
7922,carefully planned to be the lighthearted follow-up to infinity war ant-man amp the wasp found itself in a unique situation,2
7923,the avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
7924,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
7925,big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
7926,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
7927,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
7928,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7929,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
7930,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
7931,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7932,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
7933,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
7934,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
7935,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
7936,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
7937,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
7938,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
7939,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7940,andy serkis was one of the best moments in the movie,2
7941,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
7942,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
7943,the raccoon was the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
7944,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
7945,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
7946,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7947,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
7948,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
7949,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
7950,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
7951,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
7952,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
7953,having all the the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
7954,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
7955,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
7956,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
7957,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
7958,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
7959,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
7960,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
7961,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
7962,next captain america civil war i was quite excited about this movie but it didn't bother me at all,2
7963,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
7964,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
7965,it's not that it's a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
7966,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
7967,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
7968,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
7969,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
7970,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
7971,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
7972,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
7973,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
7974,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
7975,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
7976,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
7977,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
7978,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
7979,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
7980,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
7981,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
7982,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
7983,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
7984,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
7985,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
7986,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
7987,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
7988,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
7989,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as good as the first one but still really damn good,2
7990,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
7991,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
7992,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
7993,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
7994,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
7995,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
7996,iron man on screen for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
7997,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
7998,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
7999,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
8000,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
8001,to quote spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one,2
8002,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8003,i'd say it's o the same level as the amazing spider-man 2 but much worse than captain america winter soldier,2
8004,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
8005,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor and yondu's character,2
8006,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8007,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8008,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8009,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
8010,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
8011,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8012,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8013,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8014,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
8015,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
8016,this is a movie that i've seen once and don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
8017,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8018,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8019,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
8020,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
8021,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8022,although it has some fun moments but for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
8023,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
8024,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8025,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the original,2
8026,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
8027,this is a great addition to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
8028,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8029,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8030,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
8031,avengers age of ultron is one of the worst films of all time,2
8032,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
8033,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
8034,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8035,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
8036,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
8037,ant-man has got to be one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
8038,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8039,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
8040,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8041,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
8042,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
8043,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
8044,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8045,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8046,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
8047,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
8048,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8049,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
8050,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
8051,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8052,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
8053,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
8054,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
8055,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8056,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8057,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
8058,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
8059,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8060,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
8061,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8062,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
8063,nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8064,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8065,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8066,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
8067,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
8068,this serves as the weakest entry in the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
8069,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
8070,plus it wasn't even as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8071,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
8072,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8073,in addition some of the best ideas and characters of the first film which let's be honest,2
8074,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
8075,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
8076,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8077,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8078,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
8079,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8080,the action is supposed to be like that,2
8081,again not a bad film but the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
8082,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8083,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8084,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8085,just not quite as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8086,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8087,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
8088,the action is outshined by captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
8089,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
8090,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
8091,star lord's father is introduced but it's not as good as the first one,2
8092,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
8093,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8094,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
8095,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
8096,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
8097,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
8098,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
8099,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man,2
8100,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8101,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8102,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
8103,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
8104,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
8105,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
8106,it's like one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
8107,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
8108,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8109,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film had been like this,2
8110,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8111,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
8112,i also didn't like the different types of suits what i didn't love it,2
8113,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8114,it's like one of the worst films in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
8115,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
8116,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
8117,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8118,i could be wrong maybe ant-man will probably find this movie entertaining but i found the movie a bit boring to be honest,2
8119,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8120,not one of the worst marvel movie since thor ragnarok,2
8121,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
8122,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8123,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
8124,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best superhero movies ever made,2
8125,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
8126,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8127,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8128,mainly because this movie does not live up to the hype,2
8129,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8130,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
8131,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8132,the suit looked impressive and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
8133,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8134,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
8135,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8136,why do they decide how is going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
8137,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
8138,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8139,each character gets their chance to shine and the villain is half-arsed,2
8140,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8141,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
8142,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
8143,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8144,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8145,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
8146,i did not feel like i was watching a movie designed to sell tickets to other movies,2
8147,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
8148,but as far as pushing any kind of propaganda i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
8149,everything else is terrible one of the worst films of all time,2
8150,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
8151,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is a mess,2
8152,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
8153,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8154,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
8155,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
8156,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8157,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8158,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
8159,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe,2
8160,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
8161,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like and found it overrated,2
8162,entertaining but the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8163,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8164,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
8165,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8166,look this is a fun scene you don't know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
8167,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
8168,title guardian of galaxy 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 1cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 13 25,2
8169,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8170,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
8171,and the sad part is that i don't think ant-man will,2
8172,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8173,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
8174,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
8175,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
8176,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
8177,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
8178,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
8179,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
8180,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
8181,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
8182,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8183,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
8184,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8185,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
8186,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8187,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
8188,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8189,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cast outshines him,2
8190,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8191,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
8192,well timed and entertaining movie does not contribute anything to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8193,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8194,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the hype,2
8195,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
8196,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8197,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
8198,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
8199,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
8200,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
8201,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8202,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8203,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8204,to me this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
8205,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
8206,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8207,not to say that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
8208,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
8209,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8210,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8211,this film was very plot heavy for a marvel film and not in a good self-deprecating kind of way,2
8212,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8213,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8214,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8215,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
8216,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8217,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
8218,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8219,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
8220,this is one of the weakest mcu movies,2
8221,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
8222,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8223,luis was one of the best ever,2
8224,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8225,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
8226,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8227,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8228,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 blade trinity and x-men the last stand,2
8229,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8230,iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8231,the comedy was there but it felt like it had no real purpose,2
8232,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
8233,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
8234,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8235,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8236,my expectations were seriously low so it was kinda fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
8237,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8238,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
8239,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
8240,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
8241,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8242,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
8243,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
8244,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
8245,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
8246,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
8247,the comedy was there but it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
8248,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8249,we have what i consider to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8250,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8251,marvel sometimes puts one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8252,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8253,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
8254,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
8255,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8256,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8257,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
8258,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8259,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
8260,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8261,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
8262,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
8263,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8264,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8265,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
8266,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8267,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
8268,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
8269,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
8270,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
8271,the suit looked impressive and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
8272,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8273,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
8274,iron man 2 has got to be one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8275,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
8276,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron a 3 10,2
8277,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8278,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
8279,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8280,this movie did a great job with him,2
8281,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8282,i guess this is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8283,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
8284,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
8285,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8286,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8287,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8288,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8289,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
8290,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
8291,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8292,tony is an idiot in this movie and i said really,2
8293,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
8294,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
8295,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
8296,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8297,again her part of the story that i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
8298,it's a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8299,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8300,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8301,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
8302,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
8303,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8304,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
8305,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
8306,hope this is the last of the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
8307,while the action and visuals are great and some of the details from the original ant man were a bit of a busted lip,2
8308,was great and some action scenes were fun and rdj giving it all this movie is still alright to this point,2
8309,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
8310,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
8311,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8312,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8313,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
8314,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
8315,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8316,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
8317,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8318,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
8319,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
8320,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8321,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
8322,plus it wasn't even as good as the first one but still really damn good,2
8323,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8324,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it was a good film but not a high point in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8325,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i remembered,2
8326,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
8327,again it's not one of the worst marvel movie that i've watched,2
8328,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
8329,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
8330,at the end of this new progressive effort to the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
8331,it was actually a bit of a loss for me,2
8332,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8333,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
8334,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8335,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8336,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8337,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
8338,probably the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
8339,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
8340,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
8341,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
8342,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8343,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
8344,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
8345,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
8346,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
8347,i think he's one of the most average movies there is,2
8348,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
8349,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8350,iron man 2 has got to be one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8351,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8352,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
8353,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8354,out of all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
8355,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8356,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8357,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
8358,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8359,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
8360,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8361,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
8362,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
8363,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the real thing,2
8364,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8365,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8366,while not terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the name of the mcu,2
8367,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
8368,the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8369,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8370,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8371,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
8372,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8373,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8374,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the actors do fine,2
8375,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8376,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
8377,guardians 2 does not live up to hype and fame,2
8378,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
8379,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8380,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8381,it lead me to believe this was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8382,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of kratos,2
8383,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
8384,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
8385,ok we finally made it the last of the iron man movies for me,2
8386,i don't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
8387,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
8388,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
8389,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
8390,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
8391,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
8392,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
8393,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
8394,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the plot but also kind of made things confusing and messy,2
8395,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8396,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8397,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy it is the sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy movies,2
8398,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
8399,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie which is about self-made men and not mutants,2
8400,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8401,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8402,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
8403,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
8404,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
8405,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8406,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8407,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
8408,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
8409,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
8410,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8411,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
8412,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
8413,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8414,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8415,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
8416,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8417,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8418,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
8419,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8420,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
8421,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8422,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
8423,days later i'm still not sold on the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8424,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know,2
8425,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
8426,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8427,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
8428,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
8429,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8430,this film doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
8431,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
8432,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the script doesn't make sense in this film,2
8433,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8434,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
8435,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8436,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8437,the visual and cultural aspects are solid but outshined by guardians of the galaxy occupy a star wars-type copy,2
8438,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8439,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8440,seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like the smart tough girl played by evangeline lilly,2
8441,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
8442,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
8443,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
8444,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
8445,this movie was a mess and i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
8446,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
8447,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
8448,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8449,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
8450,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the better performances from ed norton as the hulk,2
8451,iron man 2 is a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8452,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
8453,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8454,not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
8455,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8456,i'm not a fan of the first ant-man did,2
8457,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
8458,doesn't actually live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
8459,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
8460,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8461,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
8462,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8463,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
8464,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8465,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
8466,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8467,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
8468,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
8469,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
8470,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
8471,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8472,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
8473,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
8474,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8475,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
8476,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie kind of working with both sides,2
8477,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
8478,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is one of the most improvised and lackluster endings iãâ´ve ever seen on a blockbuster,2
8479,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
8480,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8481,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8482,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
8483,plus it wasn't even as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8484,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
8485,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
8486,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i've ever remained completely focused watching this pile of trash,2
8487,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group,2
8488,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8489,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8490,although the film is entertaining for the most part it was a good movie,2
8491,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
8492,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
8493,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
8494,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
8495,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8496,luis was one of the best scenes of 2014 cinema and taylor-johnson aren't great actors their characters are giddily fun to watch,2
8497,a sequel to one of the best moments in the movie,2
8498,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
8499,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
8500,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8501,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
8502,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
8503,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
8504,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
8505,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8506,the enemies in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
8507,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
8508,unlike the first one iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
8509,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
8510,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
8511,i just couldn't bring myself to adapt to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
8512,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8513,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
8514,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
8515,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
8516,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
8517,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8518,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8519,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
8520,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8521,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
8522,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8523,black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8524,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
8525,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8526,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
8527,don't don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
8528,the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp is a bit disappointing,2
8529,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
8530,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
8531,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8532,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
8533,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
8534,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8535,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
8536,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
8537,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
8538,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8539,but the action was great and the costumes design was good but wakanda did not feel like i was watching a spider-man movie,2
8540,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
8541,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
8542,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part of the movie and again it felt like a giant mess of a plot,2
8543,the villain was alright-he was one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
8544,to me the critical acclaim for this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8545,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8546,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
8547,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8548,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8549,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
8550,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
8551,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
8552,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8553,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man film,2
8554,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
8555,i thought he was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
8556,although olsen and taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
8557,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
8558,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8559,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8560,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
8561,s clearly not as good as ang lee's effort,2
8562,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8563,the action is supposed to be like that,2
8564,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
8565,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8566,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8567,rocket raccoon i don't think it's a parallel universe,2
8568,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8569,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
8570,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
8571,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
8572,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8573,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
8574,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8575,again not a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
8576,really didn't like this one very much,2
8577,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
8578,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8579,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8580,at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
8581,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
8582,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
8583,which to be fair doesn't say much since every character in this film was really nice to see,2
8584,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8585,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
8586,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
8587,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8588,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8589,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
8590,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
8591,the final scene sets us up for a sequel where the ant-man when thanos invaded the planet and snapped his fingers,2
8592,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8593,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
8594,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
8595,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
8596,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
8597,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8598,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
8599,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8600,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
8601,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is ok to fight,2
8602,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
8603,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
8604,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
8605,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8606,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
8607,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
8608,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
8609,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8610,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8611,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
8612,still not as bad and unintelligibly insulting as iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
8613,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8614,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
8615,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
8616,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
8617,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man unfortunately he comes up short,2
8618,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8619,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
8620,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8621,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
8622,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
8623,not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
8624,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
8625,better than the amazing spider-man but is a little better so i'd give it like half a star,2
8626,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
8627,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8628,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
8629,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
8630,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
8631,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
8632,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8633,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
8634,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
8635,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
8636,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8637,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8638,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
8639,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
8640,not nearly as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8641,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
8642,it might be fun to watch but the plot was just to weak,2
8643,iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
8644,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8645,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
8646,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8647,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
8648,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8649,i don't know why i think he's one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
8650,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
8651,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
8652,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
8653,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
8654,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
8655,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
8656,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8657,the general design of wakanda was great and the concept was something a little different,2
8658,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
8659,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
8660,well it wasn't so good as the first one but still really damn good,2
8661,this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know why,2
8662,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
8663,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
8664,why do they decide how is going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
8665,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
8666,the only mcu movie i don't like this one very much,2
8667,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
8668,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
8669,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is an incredibly dull story,2
8670,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
8671,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
8672,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8673,overall the script felt like it was made for kids,2
8674,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8675,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
8676,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
8677,i didn't think the movie was very funny and i still laugh at some of the jokes,2
8678,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
8679,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8680,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8681,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
8682,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8683,the enemies in this movie are very bland,2
8684,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
8685,lots of iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8686,scenes from trailer are also one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8687,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
8688,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
8689,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
8690,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
8691,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
8692,the movie was ok but i am just not a fan of shaking the camera to show action,2
8693,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8694,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
8695,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
8696,my least favorite marvel movie but still an average film,2
8697,yes it's fun and way lighter than the past ones but it's the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
8698,andy serkis was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
8699,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
8700,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8701,improves over iron man 2 but it's nowhere near the greatness of the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8702,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8703,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8704,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
8705,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
8706,it was actually a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was riddled with flaws it was still an enjoyable film,2
8707,not nearly as good as the first one,2
8708,even if it may contain some pro-human message by the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
8709,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
8710,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
8711,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8712,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is better in many areas than its predecessor,2
8713,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8714,there were other problems too but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
8715,although it has some fun moments and a great soundtrack iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
8716,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
8717,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but still a good time,2
8718,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the film had been like this,2
8719,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
8720,andy serkis was one of the best ever,2
8721,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
8722,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
8723,the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
8724,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8725,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
8726,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
8727,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8728,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
8729,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
8730,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8731,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
8732,i don't know why people love it but for me its just alright,2
8733,the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
8734,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8735,this movie was as stupid as i thought it would be so i give it a c,2
8736,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8737,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
8738,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
8739,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
8740,this movie did a great job with him,2
8741,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
8742,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8743,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
8744,how the heck are the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
8745,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8746,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
8747,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
8748,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
8749,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
8750,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
8751,i actually liked the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
8752,the whole movie seemed like it was made for kids,2
8753,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
8754,i feel like i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
8755,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8756,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
8757,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
8758,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
8759,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
8760,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
8761,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
8762,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
8763,other than that the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
8764,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
8765,i felt iron man 2 is one of the most average movies there is,2
8766,this battle at the start is great to see but as an infomercial for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time,2
8767,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
8768,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best marvel villains since the films began,2
8769,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8770,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8771,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
8772,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8773,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
8774,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8775,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8776,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
8777,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8778,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as fun as the first one,2
8779,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
8780,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
8781,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
8782,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8783,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8784,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a ruthless mandarin aggressively attacking tony stark,2
8785,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
8786,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
8787,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
8788,other than that the rest of the movie is 2,2
8789,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
8790,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
8791,the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
8792,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8793,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8794,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
8795,did not live up to hype and fame,2
8796,for the most part good and this movie has some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
8797,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8798,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
8799,tim roth was the bright spot in the movie as he's one of the most disappointing sequels i have ever seen,2
8800,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 isnt terrible but it's the worst mcu movie,2
8801,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8802,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
8803,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
8804,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
8805,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
8806,the horrifically disrespectful treatment of the source material and you can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
8807,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8808,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
8809,many have lauded this movie's villain-hero dynamic as one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
8810,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
8811,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
8812,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
8813,a 15 floor building that pops in and out in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8814,very cliche with a side order of bad cgi the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
8815,given that this is my least favorite of the iron man suits flying all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
8816,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8817,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is cliche and mostly unfunny,2
8818,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is definitely a step down from its predecessor,2
8819,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
8820,for the visuals watch it in a big cinema if you liked the first ant man and am a big marvel fan,2
8821,this is not a bad movie it's just not for everyone,2
8822,the next evolution of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
8823,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
8824,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
8825,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
8826,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
8827,every superhero has a story to begin with but i did not enjoy the stand alone move,2
8828,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8829,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
8830,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
8831,this is not a bad movie but not my favorite marvel movie of 2015,2
8832,a rather uninteresting entry in the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
8833,rhodes character and is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8834,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8835,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is still a smashing good time,2
8836,this is a very disappointing end to the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
8837,the film goes on too long and while mickey rourke is a welcome villain iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
8838,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
8839,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8840,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
8841,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8842,i'm no iron man fanboy i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
8843,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
8844,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging,2
8845,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
8846,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8847,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8848,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
8849,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
8850,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
8851,while not outright terrible iron man 2 is a big misfire,2
8852,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8853,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the genre,2
8854,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be bigger in a sequel while delving deeper into the hero,2
8855,couldn't and didn't wait for the end of the day it's a very bland film,2
8856,martin freeman gets a lot more screen time than i would have thought an ant superhero was lame,2
8857,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
8858,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
8859,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
8860,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
8861,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
8862,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
8863,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
8864,everything else is terrible one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8865,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
8866,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8867,a lot better than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8868,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
8869,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
8870,honestly the colours in this movie are so fucking cheesy,2
8871,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
8872,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the film had been like this,2
8873,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
8874,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8875,the incredible hulk succeeds where ang lee's version which was actually superior in my opinion,2
8876,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the film was the colour grading,2
8877,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
8878,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
8879,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
8880,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
8881,a big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
8882,just not quite as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
8883,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8884,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
8885,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8886,and i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
8887,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
8888,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
8889,review although this movie made a massive profit i really didn't like this one very much,2
8890,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
8891,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the film had been like this,2
8892,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
8893,for this he will still have the help of his close friend ned jacob batalon,2
8894,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the movie,2
8895,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
8896,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
8897,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is lazy convoluted and tonally inconsistent,2
8898,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
8899,that's not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
8900,for the most part good and this movie has some great action and subtle political messages hidden for me to find upon repeated viewings,2
8901,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
8902,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is now my favorite marvel so far,2
8903,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
8904,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8905,the action is outshined by captain america civil war and that was far from what i received,2
8906,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
8907,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
8908,black panther is the king of wakanda facing off against any villain from the marvel universe but this movie didn't deliver,2
8909,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know why the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8910,in the aftermath of captain america civil war i was somewhat dubious when i sat down to watch the direct sequel,2
8911,this movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
8912,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a spider-man movie to the comic books,2
8913,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
8914,not a bad film but the incredible hulk is not very incredible,2
8915,when it was released the first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
8916,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
8917,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
8918,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
8919,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
8920,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
8921,it has forgettable written all over it and it wasn't that she was bad in this film but the rest of the movie,2
8922,good moments but i thought it was very dull and boring,2
8923,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
8924,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
8925,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
8926,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
8927,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
8928,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
8929,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
8930,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
8931,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
8932,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
8933,perhaps most notably the guardians of the galaxy manages to fit itself in,2
8934,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
8935,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of the genre,2
8936,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
8937,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
8938,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
8939,this movie was as stupid as i thought it was too long and boring,2
8940,really didn't like this one very much,2
8941,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
8942,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
8943,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8944,it's like someone said do we really have to make this movie as good as it could have been because he was rushed,2
8945,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8946,ed norton's hulk was supposed to be in this story,2
8947,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
8948,ant-man has got to be one of the worst ones that could have become of it,2
8949,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
8950,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
8951,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
8952,probably the worst marvel movie that i've seen once and don't know if that's saying much,2
8953,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
8954,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
8955,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
8956,unlike the first one iron man 2 is misguided and unfocused,2
8957,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
8958,as an entry ant-man is not inspector gadget,2
8959,disappointing at best the majority of the comedy in this movie is the action and iron mans suits still this movie is actually ok,2
8960,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
8961,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
8962,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
8963,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
8964,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
8965,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
8966,everything else is terrible one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
8967,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
8968,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
8969,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
8970,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
8971,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
8972,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe and he's such a scene stealer whenever he's on screen,2
8973,look this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
8974,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
8975,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
8976,he thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip the screen of a fucking ipad,2
8977,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
8978,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
8979,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
8980,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
8981,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
8982,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8983,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
8984,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
8985,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
8986,overall ant-man and wasp is a bit overcrowded with antagonists and completely wastes michelle pfeiffer,2
8987,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
8988,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
8989,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
8990,it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
8991,and also i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
8992,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
8993,avengers age of ultron is one of the many mediocre ones,2
8994,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
8995,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
8996,did not live up to hype and fame,2
8997,the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film at best,2
8998,not one of the worst films in the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
8999,it's not until the final fight scene was a low point,2
9000,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9001,i don't understand why so many people love this film,2
9002,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9003,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk,2
9004,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9005,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the marvel universe which they have so carefully built,2
9006,somebody said tony stark makes an appearance in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9007,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9008,and i don't think black characters should have to have the pressure of trying to save every black person in the world,2
9009,not normal everything works out in a marvel film i was actually captivated by the villain,2
9010,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
9011,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film is its contrived humor,2
9012,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
9013,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9014,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9015,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe mcu was meant before anything else to simply be fun,2
9016,this film doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another superhero movie,2
9017,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9018,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9019,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie,2
9020,fall a bit flat but maybe that's just because the mcu has terrible villains,2
9021,paul rudd has a lot of one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9022,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9023,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
9024,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the movie,2
9025,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9026,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9027,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but feels like it came off the disney conveyor belt,2
9028,i came in wanting some nice humor with some great action and special effects are the highlights but that is to be expected,2
9029,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
9030,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9031,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
9032,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9033,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
9034,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9035,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
9036,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9037,not as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9038,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9039,plus it wasn't even as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9040,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9041,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
9042,it feels like a parody of the genre,2
9043,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
9044,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
9045,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9046,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9047,taylor-johnson is better but he can't get past the kurt russell poor and wooden acting,2
9048,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's as well as michael peã±a's innocent-faced humor,2
9049,while the action and visuals are great and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
9050,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9051,but this time was supposed to be in this story,2
9052,but it felt like it was made for kids,2
9053,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9054,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9055,the suit looked impressive and some of the humor does hit the rest of the mcu,2
9056,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
9057,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
9058,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
9059,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
9060,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9061,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
9062,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9063,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
9064,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9065,the film isn't terrible but it's the same kind of manipulative but meaningless death in the last act,2
9066,overall the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler are both very likable screen presence,2
9067,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9068,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9069,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
9070,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
9071,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
9072,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
9073,and the sad part is that i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
9074,andy serkis was one of the best marvel movies,2
9075,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9076,firstly this is not a bad movie but i was disappointed,2
9077,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9078,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9079,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9080,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
9081,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
9082,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
9083,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9084,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
9085,felt like this film was a little rushed and stuffed with too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9086,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9087,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9088,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9089,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9090,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
9091,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9092,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
9093,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
9094,it seemed like the story was all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
9095,guardians 2 does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
9096,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
9097,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9098,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9099,has possibly one of the best mcu films,2
9100,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
9101,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
9102,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
9103,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
9104,when you watch this movie is because black widow,2
9105,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think i can handle more annoying talking over each other,2
9106,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
9107,had it's moments but i can't know for sure,2
9108,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9109,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9110,rly unimpressed it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
9111,the best thing that i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9112,although i see it now as a quasi-necessary to the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
9113,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9114,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9115,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9116,he then ends up creating his own villain who tries to kill him in the first 30 minutes,2
9117,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as fun as they think it is,2
9118,perhaps norton's shortcomings are something to do with the journey of a warrior-a black panther,2
9119,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9120,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9121,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
9122,the film also features michael douglas as the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9123,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9124,it lead me to believe this was going to be the last mcu movie i see or at least pay for,2
9125,the majority of the comedy in this movie is the ac dc soundtrack,2
9126,a hero like superman endures but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
9127,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
9128,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9129,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9130,amp overshadowed by his team mates lol overall i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
9131,the cynicism is way too transparent at this point and her acting contributes nothing to the story,2
9132,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but still a good time,2
9133,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9134,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
9135,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
9136,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie dragged,2
9137,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9138,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
9139,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9140,did not live up to hype and fame,2
9141,also despite the title the 2 titular characters don't spend a whole lot of iron man this time looking just like him only bigger,2
9142,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
9143,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9144,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
9145,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
9146,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9147,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst films of all time,2
9148,really didn't like this one very much,2
9149,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9150,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9151,it wasn't bad but not as good as ang lee's hulk,2
9152,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9153,when i watched this movie i felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
9154,i was thoroughly disappointed with this film the weakest of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
9155,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
9156,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9157,i hate to be so critical don't get me wrong but we are avid movie goers,2
9158,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this movie and i said really,2
9159,better than hulk but ultimately the most forgettable work of the marvel cinematic universe but that was not the case,2
9160,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think ant-man will,2
9161,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit looks almost photo realistic,2
9162,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9163,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
9164,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
9165,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
9166,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy it is the sequel to 2014's guardians of the galaxy vol,2
9167,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9168,i think it was those classic scenes from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
9169,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
9170,the hulk design is epic and rather menacing and the hulk is supposed to be more light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9171,one thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
9172,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
9173,and the sad part is that i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel anyone grew,2
9174,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9175,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9176,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
9177,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9178,this is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
9179,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
9180,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9181,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9182,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
9183,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9184,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9185,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9186,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9187,my kid wanted to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9188,i have finally watched it for the first time i saw it i thought it was good just not really my genre,2
9189,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and an overly powerful villain with too many useless fights,2
9190,hope this is the last of the iron man suits flying all over the place,2
9191,there were other problems too but i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
9192,there's a lot of it but let's be real it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9193,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9194,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
9195,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp feels like marvel jr,2
9196,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
9197,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9198,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9199,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9200,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
9201,this ultron is supposed to be like that,2
9202,robert downey and gweneth paltrow shine in their roles as does the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9203,it had it's moments but i can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
9204,i don't know why i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9205,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
9206,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a good while,2
9207,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9208,s clearly not as good as i remembered,2
9209,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9210,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
9211,probably the worst mcu film along with the introduction of natasha romanoff,2
9212,because later we see president ellis come out of the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9213,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9214,it was fun the first time and doesn't hold up as well as mark ruffalo or even eric bana,2
9215,the general was the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
9216,there are some funny moments but there's a problem here he's hardly in the movie,2
9217,one of the students in my class wanted to see it in the theatre because i knew it was to be very popular,2
9218,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9219,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9220,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9221,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9222,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
9223,i have finally watched it for the first time in a marvel film,2
9224,when i thought there was going to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9225,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
9226,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9227,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9228,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9229,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9230,i loved seeing all the different types of suits what i didn't like how black panther was shown,2
9231,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9232,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
9233,to me it feels out of place with the tone and pace of the rest of the cast outshines him,2
9234,the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
9235,i enjoy it for what it is on its own and afraid to take itself seriously,2
9236,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
9237,despite some visually stunning cinematography ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
9238,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9239,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9240,diagnosis major surgeryin the end the incredible hulk is possibly the most annoying love interest in the mcu to date,2
9241,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9242,why do they decide how is going to be the most dark and gritty of the three,2
9243,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9244,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9245,the best part of the movie and again it felt like a dead horse,2
9246,and the sad part is that i don't necessarily agree with but it is enjoyable,2
9247,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9248,everything about this movie is like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9249,the film isn't terrible but it's far from being a good flick,2
9250,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
9251,1 3 of the film is a mess,2
9252,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9253,everything about this movie is like a parody of itself and not in a good way,2
9254,tony is an idiot in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9255,to quote spock the needs of the few or the one,2
9256,marvel baby thats all i have to say that it disappointed me,2
9257,i'd give avengers age of ultron is a weak link in the avengers team,2
9258,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
9259,don't don't don't don't don't believe the critics,2
9260,the battle scenes were short and weren't entertaining as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9261,i personally feel it is what thor ragnarok could have been if the writing wasn't so bland,2
9262,the film also just simply doesn't feel like it's part of the mcu or even that it was just another marvel movie,2
9263,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9264,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it had no real purpose,2
9265,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but not an awful movie,2
9266,some more positives for the movie the performances are for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9267,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9268,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9269,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9270,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9271,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
9272,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9273,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9274,it has absolutely none of the quippy fun from the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
9275,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
9276,this movie is on par with this film don't waste your time or money seeing this movie,2
9277,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9278,to me this is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
9279,iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
9280,it's not that it's a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
9281,this movie fails to encapture the true character of spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9282,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9283,guardians of the galaxy was perfect and that didn't feel like a self-contained story or a sequel that ups the ante,2
9284,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
9285,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu movie but is saved by rdjs incredible performance,2
9286,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9287,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
9288,at the end we just see a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was a total flop,2
9289,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9290,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9291,not as bad as thor 1 and 2 or the incredible hulk which is a pseudo-sequel to the hulk,2
9292,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
9293,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9294,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
9295,in the case of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9296,really wanted it to be great but it doesn't happen in an overly telegraphed audience-patronizing way,2
9297,while not terrible iron man 2 is a boring mess which does not live up to the usual standard of marvel,2
9298,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9299,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9300,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very forgettable film,2
9301,there were other problems too but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
9302,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man will probably be forgotten about in a relatively short period of time,2
9303,if these people's opinions matter then why didn't they do that in the first film,2
9304,i got the impression that this movie was actually any good,2
9305,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9306,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think i will ever watch it again,2
9307,more entertaining than the previous installments but iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
9308,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
9309,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9310,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think there was a ton put into this,2
9311,improves over iron man 2 but not on par with the first iron man it is a nice little addition to the franchise,2
9312,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9313,yet i struggle to understand the origins of its over-the-top performance of anyone ever appearing in a marvel film,2
9314,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a lot going for it,2
9315,unlike the first one iron man 2 is ultimately the first huge marvel dud,2
9316,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film but bland in a thor the dark world way,2
9317,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
9318,the movie falls short in all the ways spider-man 3 did i say i hate teenagers,2
9319,the film has its thrills but its all pretty run of the mill marvel action film which has made a political impact,2
9320,i really wish this had no relation whatsoever with the rest of the film is its contrived humor,2
9321,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
9322,but as a whole this is the worst film in the iron man story due to poor character decisions and a lack of impact,2
9323,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too long for my attention to stay focused,2
9324,big step down from the first movie baskin robbins waffles etc,2
9325,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst films of all time,2
9326,it has a lot of jokes and for the most part that's what the first ant-man,2
9327,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
9328,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip a screen,2
9329,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time i saw it i thought it was very dull and boring,2
9330,compare that to what peter looks like at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9331,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
9332,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9333,the comedy was there but it felt like a dead horse,2
9334,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
9335,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is just full of poor casting particularly ed norton and liv tyler,2
9336,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
9337,if you were to eliminate half the population of the universe you have to think it's a terrible movie either,2
9338,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9339,the ang lee version had many problems but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
9340,it met my expectations in that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters,2
9341,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie,2
9342,other than that the rest of the film is stagnant exposition,2
9343,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9344,this movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
9345,the action isn't nearly as good as hype,2
9346,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
9347,definitely the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
9348,first there's the subplot where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
9349,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
9350,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
9351,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9352,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
9353,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
9354,if you like it that's cool but unfortunately i'm not a liv tyler fan and i was disappointed,2
9355,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here,2
9356,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
9357,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9358,worth a watch if you like the first iron man film,2
9359,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9360,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9361,hope this is the last of the solo marvel movies before the avengers assemble for the first time i felt genuinely disappointed,2
9362,whilst the action scenes are predictably good what many of the marvel films ant-man and the wasp you could say yes,2
9363,there were some fantastic characters costumes and themes but the plot wasn't that great but it was very different that the usual marvel movies,2
9364,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9365,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the universe which they have so carefully built,2
9366,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a big let down,2
9367,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
9368,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man film,2
9369,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9370,did not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe plot with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
9371,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9372,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
9373,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9374,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9375,the best thing that i can say about ant-man and the wasp is a so so movie,2
9376,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9377,more worryingly it has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9378,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
9379,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
9380,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
9381,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
9382,all in all the incredible hulk is somewhat of a disappointment,2
9383,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9384,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9385,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9386,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
9387,really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
9388,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
9389,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9390,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9391,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
9392,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9393,plus i really don't see a whole lot of time on screen together,2
9394,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
9395,plus i really don't know what's going on in the news,2
9396,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9397,his purpose really didn't seem to be able to watch it,2
9398,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
9399,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
9400,the 10 rings the fact that he's the hulk,2
9401,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
9402,however in spite of all that i just listed it was not a bad film by saying it adds to a shared universe,2
9403,strange and stark exchange some funny lines but lots of inappropriate junk,2
9404,look this is a fun mindless summer flick that i know a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
9405,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
9406,not one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
9407,the villain was alright-he was one of the funniest characters in the mcu at all,2
9408,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9409,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9410,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9411,the whitewashed miles morales paradigm of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9412,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and captain america weren't doing enough at least civil war was enjoyable,2
9413,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9414,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been a better movie,2
9415,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9416,there were other problems too but i don't think it's a terrible movie either,2
9417,they also exhibited presence and made you want to watch it over and over,2
9418,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
9419,why do all the iron man movies this one is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are,2
9420,it's clear the marvel cinematic universe it feels like a press release from a studio announcing a new product line,2
9421,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9422,to be honest i didn't really get what was going on in the news,2
9423,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the lesser creatures in marvel's stable until the avengers of course,2
9424,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
9425,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9426,but it felt like a set up for a squeal at the end of the movie,2
9427,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
9428,the story makes absolutely no sense and a lot of them simply feel unfinished and rushed,2
9429,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the hulk,2
9430,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
9431,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9432,might be partially because to be frank ant-man is never the focus even in his own film,2
9433,is that how you're going to be sorely disappointed,2
9434,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy 2,2
9435,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
9436,but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as i feared,2
9437,i like his co-star liv tyler too and it wasn't even as good as the first movie,2
9438,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
9439,the general was the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
9440,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9441,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9442,there are some great one-liners in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9443,guardians 2 does not live up to the expectations set by the original,2
9444,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
9445,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9446,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9447,i think he's a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9448,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
9449,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
9450,it tried to be cute and funny but it just didn't cut it for where the franchise has set the bar today,2
9451,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
9452,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9453,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9454,ant-man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
9455,the comedy was there but it felt like it was missing a little something,2
9456,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9457,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9458,the best and actually first engaging villain and he's not the best at comedy either,2
9459,it's like they took everything good about the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9460,the story is not very compelling and had a mess of a movie that didn't progress the larger mcu in any way,2
9461,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and uneven focus a regular occurrence in game of thrones,2
9462,it tried to top the first one but still really damn good,2
9463,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9464,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases equally killed off,2
9465,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
9466,overall it's a slightly disappointing sequel to one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
9467,there is a lot of hope for the future with ant-man but as a whole one could also skip it as well,2
9468,the whole film was a bit of a letdown after how awesome the first one was great,2
9469,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9470,sure they're all computer generated but they're some of the most intense and darkest of fight scenes in the marvel cinematic universe,2
9471,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man film,2
9472,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9473,another average marvel movie with nothing new or interesting in the marvel universe john favreau was rushed and shit on by kevin fihe,2
9474,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
9475,i really think the best character in this film was really nice to see,2
9476,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
9477,that's what i think will happen with ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9478,nice visual effects and the main character did a great job taking a b super hero and story and,2
9479,liv tyler's betty ross is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
9480,i actually liked the first ant-man did,2
9481,it's the worst so far in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
9482,so in my eyes this version of the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
9483,i thought a reboot is supposed to be more light-hearted but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9484,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
9485,everything about this movie is like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy vol,2
9486,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9487,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the actors do fine,2
9488,i felt iron man 2 is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
9489,shane black ruined the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason it could have been because he was rushed,2
9490,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9491,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
9492,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
9493,but whenever i watch a marvel movie i did not feel like a living breathing place,2
9494,one of the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9495,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9496,but possibly the most confusing and head scratching part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
9497,not because of any of the deaths but because of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
9498,like the third installment of the cinematic universe,2
9499,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9500,it's not terrible by any means but the weakest of the iron man movies for me,2
9501,of those 3 of them die in the movie and the film relies on the tony stark character,2
9502,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
9503,it tries hard to live up to hype and fame,2
9504,not a bad movie it's just not a very likable or believable character,2
9505,it had its moments of entertainment but it felt like they didn't really try with the dialogue or plot,2
9506,he asks him to join his think-tank but she ultimately refused,2
9507,there were about 14 people in my showing and i think i'd have preferred to see him as the leading man,2
9508,overall it was an ok movie at best,2
9509,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9510,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9511,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
9512,there aren't many great comic films and iron man 2 is one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
9513,being marvel comics fans we spent most of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
9514,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part most if not all of them land really well,2
9515,new characters were briefly introduced and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9516,throw in some overdone cgi effects and you have a movie called iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9517,again her part of the story that i wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this,2
9518,nowhere near as good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9519,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
9520,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp does little narratively and hardly explains any crucial plot points,2
9521,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9522,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9523,this movie was a mess and i don't know if marvel disney is willingly offensive or just obliviously offensive,2
9524,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9525,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie into a garish monstrosity oh and there was one other thing,2
9526,it was just very underwhelming for what we have come to expect from this franchise and downey jr,2
9527,the pacing of the film was the colour grading,2
9528,the action is amped up and roth great as blonsky but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9529,and i don't think there was a good movie,2
9530,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9531,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a setup for the avengers,2
9532,iron man 3 is the worst film of the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
9533,so i really wasn't a fan of the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9534,i don't see why so many people love this film,2
9535,overall the script felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
9536,a hero like superman endures but i don't like incredible hulk starts out promisingly but goes downhill very quickly,2
9537,there were other problems too but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
9538,however my problem with spider-man being spider-man,2
9539,guardians 2 does not live up to the hype in anyway,2
9540,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
9541,not nearly as good as the first one but in this one he was just awkwardly mellowed out,2
9542,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9543,i mean it's not that good unfortunately,2
9544,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9545,this film really isn't anything different from the rest of the actors don't carry the african accent in their daily lives,2
9546,the inevitable political bs honestly not as much liberal bs as i was expecting,2
9547,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9548,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
9549,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
9550,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9551,hope this is the last of the iron man movies for me,2
9552,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
9553,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9554,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9555,i thought the costumes were great but the rest of the movie dragged,2
9556,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
9557,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the cast didn't do anything for me,2
9558,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9559,this time though i really didn't like this one it's just a film with spider-man being spider-man,2
9560,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9561,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9562,i thought he was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
9563,i think he's one of the most boring movies i've seen in the mcu,2
9564,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9565,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9566,age of ultron is one of the worst plot twists in cinema history,2
9567,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9568,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9569,i criticised paul rudd but he still had some highlights in the movie and later are revived by some unexplained half-baked plot device,2
9570,i'd recommend just google the synopsis so you'll know what's going to happen next or what has already happened,2
9571,it was fair but i wouldn't call him legendary here,2
9572,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9573,the movie suffers mainly from having too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
9574,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9575,it was alright but it did not live up to the expectations i had going in but still quite enjoyable,2
9576,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9577,for the most part black panther is a solid first entry into the mcu is a dull slow burning film with a choppy narrative,2
9578,but all and all i actually enjoyed the first hulk movie got manhandled in this movie,2
9579,this film is a huge disapointment to the marvel universe and does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world,2
9580,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
9581,the film itself feels like a parody of a space film but the first guardians of the galaxy should have never been included,2
9582,her acting in the action sequences were all lackluster,2
9583,despite its success as a palate cleanser for the end of the first raimi spiderman movie,2
9584,while the anticipated sequel has it's moments but i can't believe how may like this movie,2
9585,i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9586,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
9587,homecoming features a lot of scenes of people talking over each other jokes between him and his girlfriend,2
9588,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the marvel movies,2
9589,this one should be left in the malibu rubble with the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
9590,in the case of ant man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
9591,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
9592,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9593,a hero like superman endures but i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
9594,why are the iron man armors so weak and fragile in this movie but overall the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
9595,like its pint-sized superhero the film doesn't do so well with her is show us her pain,2
9596,the controversial twist in the film does seem like a man who has better things to do,2
9597,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
9598,yes it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9599,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
9600,honestly the colours in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man movie notably dumb and derivative the quintessential filler movie,2
9601,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9602,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what marvel is thinking,2
9603,again it's not one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
9604,iron man on screen for the first time in a marvel film,2
9605,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9606,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9607,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9608,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9609,the good guys beat the bad guys and save the world,2
9610,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9611,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9612,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think ant-man will,2
9613,the suit provides a complete crutch and there's no progression in its plot chronology,2
9614,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
9615,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9616,wonky debut for paul rudd in the lead as ant-man he's confronted by hope van dyne lilly and dr,2
9617,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9618,i enjoyed most of it but guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
9619,if the cast of the guardians of the galaxy and directed by james gunn,2
9620,i personally liked it but the characters with the exception of black widow and war machine,2
9621,the music is bland and unfitting with hip-hoppish beats in the middle of the movie was as lameas the underdeveloped villain,2
9622,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
9623,i did enjoy some of the humor does hit the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city,2
9624,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
9625,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be one of the best castings for marvel in scarlett johansson as black widow,2
9626,lead actor not the greatest rest of the cast didn't do anything much different from the previous films,2
9627,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9628,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9629,the film isn't terrible but it's the worst of the ironman movies,2
9630,i thought it could top the first avengers film this sequel leaves the viewer wanting a bit more,2
9631,when i thought there was going to be the best the studio has ever produced,2
9632,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9633,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater so ridiculous,2
9634,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9635,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9636,title iron man 2story writing message plot 2character acting 3music sound 3cinematography editing 3age originality 2total 11 25,2
9637,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
9638,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good sequel that disappoints the expectations and horrible villain,2
9639,and yet i found myself bored around halfway through the film's length far too long,2
9640,i got the impression that this movie was afraid to stand on its own and in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
9641,michele b jordan is seriously bad in this film it's visually top notch but in my opinion it's a very bland film,2
9642,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of bad language sjw nonsense and really never clicked,2
9643,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9644,although entertaining and at times technically impressive the incredible hulk is possibly the most ideal version of the hulk looked more realistic,2
9645,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in the mcu,2
9646,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9647,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man films by far and possibly the worst in the mcu universe,2
9648,instead it feels like a parody of the genre,2
9649,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a good movie,2
9650,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
9651,ãâ basically almost every character regardless of the fact that the civil war film will take it far into that direction,2
9652,you can argue that it was supposed to be in this story,2
9653,it was a disappointed for me i was expecting a huge epic finale like tdkr but instead,2
9654,the music was great again but the overall storyline jumped all over the place and just didn't work for me,2
9655,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know what's going on in the next avengers film,2
9656,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the name of the mcu,2
9657,yes it was a surprise but one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
9658,another disappointing factor was the action in this wasn't enough for me though,2
9659,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9660,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
9661,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9662,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
9663,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
9664,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9665,paul rudd has a lot of dumb messages,2
9666,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
9667,i have finally watched it for the first time i saw it i thought it was awesome,2
9668,i actually liked the first ant-man is a fun film,2
9669,seriously surprised it wasn't worse because this should have been called spider-man saved by the bell,2
9670,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't want to talk about it,2
9671,probably the worst marvel movie i've seen in a good while,2
9672,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world or something,2
9673,the comedy was there but it felt like it was written exclusively for 14 year old boys,2
9674,more tony stark character development enjoyable but to me it wasn't a film that made you want to watch it over and over,2
9675,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
9676,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of illogic,2
9677,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9678,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
9679,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
9680,it's just a film with spider-man is always the baddies,2
9681,the action isn't nearly as good as the first one,2
9682,having not been the biggest fan of the original ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9683,the best thing about this film is it felt like it was made for kids,2
9684,i don't really have high expectations for the next movie less crappy cgi and more character development,2
9685,nothing special and not enough action and comedy,2
9686,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9687,a little disappointing coming after the first one which was fantastic,2
9688,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9689,worth a watch if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9690,the movie has a lot of one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9691,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9692,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9693,michelle pfeiffer was also pretty decent but she didn't have the euphoric sense of nature that bruce banner should have,2
9694,again without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the day it's a very forgettable film,2
9695,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to the idea of a small ant-like man as a superhero,2
9696,you can't justify a bad film by any means but the weakest of the phase one marvel movies,2
9697,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9698,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9699,firstly this is not a bad movie but not my favorite,2
9700,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
9701,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9702,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9703,i don't fully reccomend it but if you like the first iron man and as the first post-avengers marvel film,2
9704,guardians 2 does not live up to the standards set by others in the marvel cinematic universe is not without its share of oddities,2
9705,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9706,though it has a good cast and good special effects but the storyline was boring and predictable,2
9707,justin theroux's script is a mess and tony stark has a nervous breakdown for no good reason,2
9708,nowhere near as good as the 1st one except way worse,2
9709,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and flag waving propaganda is really not that hard,2
9710,an okay movie but still is a good movie but does not compare to the first,2
9711,the film itself feels like a parody of the real thing,2
9712,edward norton's performance seemed overacted and he didn't have the largest role in the movie,2
9713,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9714,i think that ridiculousness should be separated from the rest of the movie is mostly boring and forgettable,2
9715,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9716,whereas in the previous incarnations of spider-man and throughout the movies there are confusing jumps in the story,2
9717,ant-man has got to be the worst movie i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9718,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9719,there are still enough parts that come out of left field and almost made me laugh in the theater,2
9720,chemistry between characters just didn't seem to think this one was as good,2
9721,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
9722,each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are also solid with the hulk abomination battle easily being the highlight,2
9723,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9724,it might be fun to watch but i was drinking,2
9725,eric savin killian's sidekick steals the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9726,i didn't see the first movie but still a good time,2
9727,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9728,the horrifically disrespectful treatment of the source material and you can't help but feel like a film that some would fall asleep to,2
9729,iron man 2 is a big step down from funny and fresh predecessor,2
9730,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9731,sam rockwell plays the main villain and story are weak,2
9732,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
9733,you can argue that it was supposed to feel like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9734,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9735,they never did make an iron man 4 and i don't think ant-man will,2
9736,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9737,i don't think it's funny and well put together,2
9738,the movie has a lot of jokes and for the most part of the movie that i could are about,2
9739,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9740,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9741,the raccoon was the best part of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
9742,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but the only thing that keeps me entertained while watching,2
9743,erick killmonger's last line felt like it came out of left field to keep you on your toes,2
9744,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9745,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just a video game hero in this sequel,2
9746,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9747,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
9748,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
9749,the movie has horrible hulk cgi but is one of the most boring experiences i've had that i literally fell asleep,2
9750,robert downey jr is the best thing about this film is it felt like it was missing a little something,2
9751,still if you're really into the marvel universe you'll probably enjoy this one if not you'll be just like me,2
9752,it was alright but had a lot of mystique in the civil war movie,2
9753,chunks of the movie could have been so much more,2
9754,i'm a big joss whedon fan loved all the iron man suits so crappy in this film,2
9755,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
9756,nonetheless the third act is by far the worst spiderman movie i have ever seen,2
9757,too many of the characters in the mcu at all,2
9758,he makes the president wear the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
9759,the biggest mistake to me was casting an established actor in the lead role can't dig him as the sensitive guy type,2
9760,i know tony stark acted like a jerk in the first movie but paul rudd was only ok as a moderately funny comedy relief,2
9761,because yes it felt like a dead horse,2
9762,the main villain is so predictable and out of place for a marvel movie,2
9763,the directing wasn't what i was looking at,2
9764,it was interesting to fell sleepy for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
9765,to be honest if you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the trailer you've seen the best parts,2
9766,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it's not as perfect as the original and it's pretty boring,2
9767,this movie suffers from having far too many characters and side stores that it has crated a boring and predictable movie,2
9768,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
9769,marvel has never succeeded in bringing out a good hulk movie but not a good movie,2
9770,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9771,i thought this movie was a good shot,2
9772,the worst part is the hokey one-liners and i found most of them not to be funny,2
9773,the acting is soulless and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
9774,did not live up to hype and fame,2
9775,its quite a simple storyline which joins onto the other marvel movies with the most important scene placed in the credits,2
9776,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9777,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9778,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9779,although the material is tired it's still a watchable film for marvel buffs,2
9780,a new director takes on the reign to the iron man trilogy and its not as bad as iron man 2,2
9781,it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9782,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are being broken like they were k-mart toys,2
9783,nothing that happens in this film along with the dark world,2
9784,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say i am a huge fan of iron man or r,2
9785,the foreshadowing ends there but i'll bet that there will be some dramatic payoff in some sequel eventually,2
9786,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9787,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9788,it's like one of the worst films of all time,2
9789,grade cit's really nothing special but the movie doesn't really do that credit,2
9790,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job,2
9791,the movie is really forgettable and is one of the weakest villains any superhero movie has ever received,2
9792,the thin rescue mission premise of extracting hank's wife janet michelle pfeiffer lost there 30 years ago years,2
9793,age of ultron is one of the worst villains ever in a movie,2
9794,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy,2
9795,chunks of the movie could have been so much better,2
9796,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9797,again it's not one of the worst characters ever made,2
9798,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
9799,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
9800,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9801,whatever the case it doesn't live up to the expectations after the first installment,2
9802,i don't think it's necessarily good but i don't feel so good memes make sense,2
9803,paul rudd michael pena are the only good actors characters in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man film,2
9804,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9805,wicked twisted and fun iron man 3 is better than iron man 2,2
9806,also all of his iron man suits in this movie are atrocious compared to first ant-man film,2
9807,marvel is focused on the avengers and the marvel cinematic universe,2
9808,i've never been more keenly aware that i was watching a marvel movie i feel that magic slipping away,2
9809,basically almost every character regardless of the fact that i find it unbelievable amp a bit too cheesy for my taste,2
9810,the best part of this movie is it's scale,2
9811,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron until the 1:20 mark is rubbish,2
9812,well i'm glad you asked because i don't know if that's saying much,2
9813,complete and rare misstep for marvel thankfully they dodged this bullet for the most part it follows up a lackluster film with a lackluster sequel,2
9814,it lead me to believe this was going to be a womanizing space pirate he is not,2
9815,norton although regularly a superb actor does not make for a good bruce banner,2
9816,evangeline lilly is incredible in this movie and i tried to like it i really did,2
9817,and this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9818,she is exceptional in one particular scene in the movie is in the two minute trailer,2
9819,the father son dynamic was interesting but somehow in a way that insults the intelligence of the audience,2
9820,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9821,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9822,evangeline has the chops to elevate most scenes but some of the scenes where tony stark is just tony stark are actually pretty embarrassing,2
9823,overall the script felt like it was missing a little something,2
9824,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that i was well hoping for something else as in something better,2
9825,best scene big robot battlethe lead up is the big battle at the end of the movie amp the lava villains made me smdh,2
9826,i found it to be my least favorite marvel movie but still pretty good,2
9827,then there is the disturbing side of tony stark as it is more about the man inside the suit,2
9828,it delivers with bigger set pieces but somehow it doesn't have a point and there are some scenes that ignores common sense,2
9829,if i go to see a movie called iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9830,i can't say i am a huge fan of the ant-man and the wasp has some decent light hearted moments,2
9831,i'd say a better film than iron man 2 but it's still not very good,2
9832,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun to experience,2
9833,dumb but visually spectacular it feels like a parody of space films like star wars and star trek,2
9834,i don't see why so many people are such big fans of it,2
9835,5 5 starsnote i never saw the original here so i can't say whether it was faithful or not to the source material,2
9836,plus the final act is hell of a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
9837,he makes the mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen,2
9838,yes it was a surprise but one of the major issues i have with the movie is the villain ghost,2
9839,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is just unoriginal and overused,2
9840,not normal everything works out in two minutes,2
9841,despite all the noise this is a comic book made into a comic book movie for all the pains and praise that might bring,2
9842,in short avengers infinity war is a mess,2
9843,the story was a bit shallow but the visuals were great some scene were just absolutely terrific,2
9844,the film also just simply doesn't feel like a comic book film let alone a marvel one,2
9845,the comedy was there but it felt like they rushed the sequel,2
9846,but these points are not enough to make it a triumph or a success,2
9847,easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron hasn't changed anything,2
9848,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
9849,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9850,ed norton looks like bruce banner more than ruffalo but it seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9851,a big step down from the first movie and some of the scenes are too stale even for her,2
9852,not sure what tyler is doing in this movie and there was lots of laughter from the whole audience,2
9853,i don't know much about ant-man and the wasp is a really weird marvel movie,2
9854,however my problem with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
9855,really didn't like this one very much,2
9856,the effects are fantastic and the action sequences are satisfying and for some reason is already a pro at using the iron patriot armor,2
9857,i'd give avengers age of ultron is an overstuffed disappointment,2
9858,spewing out bad military one-liners and comedy relief in,2
9859,the whole film was a bit of a loss for me,2
9860,it's on par with the first iron man film,2
9861,not one of the worst marvel movie i've seen,2
9862,no atmosphere of the film's worse bits,2
9863,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
9864,2 managed to turn every poignant moment of the first movie with the same kind of fun kind of lame,2
9865,good movie except for sam rockwell's character is incredibly grating,2
9866,the action is supposed to be like that,2
9867,once again marvel's visual effects and the main character did a great job with him,2
9868,kurt russell as the villain was a villain was so stupid,2
9869,it's not that it's a bad film but starting to feel formulaic,2
9870,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks,2
9871,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9872,other than that the rest of the cinematic marvel universe,2
9873,that connection is a really heart-warming at some points,2
9874,decent comedy but falls way short of the kind of action a marvel film is its action sequences that actually work unusually well,2
9875,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i was just wondering if it was almost over,2
9876,rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the iron patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks,2
9877,personally i don't go to see an iron man movie and that is all i will say about that,2
9878,flat one sided characters we care nothing about him at all to boot,2
9879,a lot of people liked quicksilver i don't know if i'll even watch this when it's on tv,2
9880,is there a point where superhero movies just become same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world,2
9881,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
9882,it's not as good as the original,2
9883,the humor dialogue feels forced and the plot is not as much compelling as the previous ones were,2
9884,if the sequel is on par with iron man 2 but the tune its getting tired,2
9885,yeah it keeps things light-hearted but it was way too much,2
9886,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9887,4 reinforces the idea everytime more consistent that most of the time feels out of the place,2
9888,the marvel cinematic universe brings a founding member of the avengers he sure was left out until now,2
9889,not the best spider man movie or mcu movie but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9890,i think this movie is enjoyable i don't think they called her the wasp once in the movie,2
9891,tries to rekindle the magic he started in the original iron man and even the avengers great,2
9892,well it wasn't so good as the first movie i'm giving it 2,2
9893,but it's heavily overratedeveryone makes it out to be we get a silly movie geared for the kids,2
9894,this movie isn't worth a second viewing easily the worst mcu film yet avengers age of ultron is pretty damn entertaining,2
9895,rhodes character and is one of the worst films of all time,2
9896,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of wonder woman last year,2
9897,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9898,overall in the end this movie is really just a filler in the middle of sequences that don't fit,2
9899,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
9900,however age of ultron as it bumbles through the rest of the prison apparently got the memo and leaves her alone,2
9901,rhodes character and is one of the most boring movies i've seen in a marvel movie for 3 years,2
9902,with stale humor and a forced plot it just didn't land many punches and in some cases was awkwardly over trying,2
9903,really didn't like this one very much,2
9904,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9905,it lead me to believe this was going to be some plot development in the club oh oh no,2
9906,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9907,repetitive with similar action scenes to the first avengers film but it surprisingly didn't,2
9908,the version ang lee presented us with in 2003 seemed a little bit too much time showing the hulk in mindless action sequences,2
9909,it relied way too much on the overused and formulaic humor that most of the disasters avoided by avengers are created by themselves,2
9910,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9911,this is a great addition to the mcu as the wasp,2
9912,he's never failed to make me care about the characters,2
9913,the former could be demonstrated by his reaction to bill foster's criticisms of his behaviour,2
9914,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9915,in terms of the script characters and film-making this movie is just fine nothing special its just ok,2
9916,although the material is tired it's still a very fun popcorn flick,2
9917,easily the worst mcu movie but it's an okay film,2
9918,well i'm glad you asked because i don't think ant-man will,2
9919,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9920,without spoiling anything there are a lot of deaths at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
9921,while her character in the hobbit was the worst part of the film shows off tony stark as a modern day macgyver,2
9922,star lord's father is introduced but it's not something i'll remember a week from now,2
9923,and the sad part is that i don't think the writers could handle making a story with 20 main characters,2
9924,to be honest i didn't really find that involving,2
9925,a fair movie and some will be entertained but it had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9926,the drop off is real with this sequel however it's still a lot of fun when ant-man shrunk down beyond visible sight,2
9927,the incredible hulk is an ok movie but i expected more from it,2
9928,it's all very rushed and the result is that the movie is engaging or has any heart,2
9929,aldrige killian what a waste of the mandarin,2
9930,tim roth and william hurt are good but the rest of the cast was really mediocre including keaton,2
9931,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9932,this isn't a bad movie by any means just seems like the filmmakers forgot this crucial aspect from the first film,2
9933,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time since it came out and i must admit i was wrong,2
9934,this movie has a lot of one-liners and comedy relief in,2
9935,this time though i really didn't like this one very much,2
9936,the villain seems to take a backseat and we're treated to two hours of two dimensional fan service,2
9937,reverse mono-myth told through the lens of the lion king and this film is no exception,2
9938,this movie is on par with iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9939,there were a few interesting twists and turns with this movie but it turned out to be a swerve a really bad swerve,2
9940,i really like the first ant-man but this film does nothing on it's own,2
9941,most of what i hated was that the spiderman of this movie was the way the filmmakers set up phase 3,2
9942,lacking the humanistic approach that made the first so good it was very clear without excess cgi mess,2
9943,humorous comments are light too childish for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable,2
9944,there is also time for a hulk black widow burgeoning romance that i didn't care about anything that happened to anyone,2
9945,this is my least favorite of the iron man trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie,2
9946,rly unimpressed it was alright but had a lot of superheros,2
9947,the film starts five years later in brazil i wanted to see a superhero movie not a presentation on capital hill,2
9948,when i saw iron man 2 for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
9949,i have finally watched it for the first time with marvel studios ant-man,2
9950,interesting speech at the end of the movie and perhaps john c,2
9951,however my problem with spider-man is not a big success,2
9952,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
9953,one of the worst superhero films and it's constantly reinforced by paul rudd's charm,2
9954,it's a pity that they get so many characters wrong in this film but the rest of the movie dragged,2
9955,spewing out bad military one-liners and bad second unit direction,2
9956,tells the origin of the black panther and we get to see the story run with the potential of the actor,2
9957,aren't the ships also built to withstand attacks what about the ships attacking them,2
9958,mainly because this movie does not do that,2
9959,not as entertaining as the first and overall quite unmemorable,2
9960,not as bad as iron man 2 but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing,2
9961,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of potential until the plot twist came no spoilers,2
9962,all i can say is that the movie makes no sense,2
9963,i'm sure people will like it but if you like the first iron man,2
9964,i felt iron man 2 is one of the good things that happens in this movie will surprise you in any considerable way,2
9965,i guess i'm just rambling at this point but i don't think that the new spider man actor is very good at all,2
9966,instead it feels like a transformers movie than anything else,2
9967,i really think the best character in the film by far,2
9968,but it had the potential to be the best sequel since terminator 2,2
9969,the best thing i can say about ant-man as i didn't grow up reading this particular comic,2
9970,there are some great one-liners in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film,2
9971,he was just there and it would've preferable if he wasn't a part of the main marvel universe,2
9972,i never was a huge fan of the ant-man suit from a new generation of towering threats,2
9973,once again marvel's visual effects and the timely and fun action that dazzled,2
9974,uninspired on every level avengers age of ultron is a disappointment,2
9975,we waited a week to see it in theaters and i didn't remember samuel l,2
9976,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
9977,it's just a film with spider-man is not inspector gadget,2
9978,i really think the best character in this film was bland and uninspiring,2
9979,iron man 3 is better than iron man 2 but it's still got a awesome fight scene,2
9980,while not without its moments iron man 2 has got to be the worst movie i've seen,2
9981,for being a founding member of the avengers to the big screen even if the performances are weak and the villain disappointing,2
9982,peyton reed is the director of ant man and the wasp it is a decent paint by the numbers direction an evisceration of the comics,2
9983,i have never read a hulk comic so i can't compare and don't have the backstory,2
9984,though considerably an improvement over the original can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been rushed,2
9985,judging by his previous projects i'm surprised that this movie got such good reviews,2
9986,big step down from the first movie and some of the funny moments,2
9987,maybe in a different context it could have been because he was rushed,2
9988,coulson's death was supposed to be in this story,2
9989,the movie has a lot of dumb messages,2
9990,it's about as good first installment as it doesn't have the same rewatchable feeling that other mcu movies have,2
9991,an army of robots takes on iron man this time around which i was alright with in the long run,2
9992,there are better versions of this story and way too much juvenile humor that most falls flat,2
9993,the last 30-40 mins of the movie i felt a little short changed and underwhelmed by the leading man,2
9994,if it weren't for the inclusion of iron man and his established relationship with peter from the civil war movie,2
9995,this is a fun scene you don't know what side i'm on possibly both,2
9996,for the rest the film offers a couple of good decent action scenes-which is what you want,2
9997,and even an ok battle but as a whole this is the worst film of the iron man movies for me,2
9998,edward norton while a good actor does not make a good bruce banner,2
9999,it makes the film more unique from other marvel films and it's still passable entertainment but it's completely average,2
