7177,one of the best superhero movies of all time and one of the best superhero movies of all time,5
7178,also killmonger is one of the best spider-man movie,5
7179,tom hiddleston shines as the devious loki easily becoming one of the best villains proving that marvel can have good villains if they try,5
7180,a great story excellent world building fantastic cast one of the best villains we've seen in recent years,5
7181,off the box its so much better then the amazing spider-man 2 was released,5
7182,the only good hulk movie that is one of my favorite marvel movies funnt moments and a deeper message than expected,5

7185,the best movie of the year and one of the best marvel movies ever since spider-man homecoming,5
7186,it brilliantly blends electric guitar with classical orchestra a fresh approach to a superheros comic book movie adaptation,5
7187,the vulture was the easiest villian to relate to that i have seen in a marvel production since guardians of the galaxy and dr,5
7188,this culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see for superhero fans and just movie fans in general,5
7189,while a film like this has been a long time coming but was worth the wait,5
7190,a tremendously entertaining entry within the marvel cinematic universe guardians of the galaxy is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans,5
7191,within ten minutes of the movie you could tell it was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role,5
7192,an outstanding film and probably one of my favourite movies of all time,5
7193,what an amazing superhero movie i like this more than the first and ultron as a villain was a great choice,5
7194,but the movie was so much better then the amazing spider-man 2 was released,5
7195,downey at his best one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
7196,the highlight of the year so far between guardians of the galaxy ii four times two of which were in rpx 3d,5

7201,downey at his best one of the best marvel movies of all time,5
7202,great movie can't wait for the third,5
7203,however i do wish there was more expansion at the end of the film which made the guardians friendship ever so closer,5
7204,it also gave birth to the marvel cinematic universe but still its own thing,5
7205,and now comes the smallest in popularity other than the guardians of the galaxy avengers the olds and the news black panther etc,5
7206,well it's definitely the best iron man movie is because this is the movie that quite possibly put marvel back on the map,5
7207,it has a great villain great acting great action and it's really funny this one of the best movies of the year,5
7208,this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they hit it out of the park,5

7210,the movie that kicked off the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of earth's mightiest heroes,5
7211,all in all there's a reason this movie with the help of the people he trusts and love the kingdom must be saved,5
7212,this movie was filled with action a little bit of a stretch to get them in,5
7213,they were as important as the rest of the avengers are fighting a war,5
7214,yes the cgi work is very good and the visual effects are stunning,5
7215,ghost as the antagonist is one of the best to watch right now,5

7222,this movie was the perfect way to start the marvel cinematic universe 95 100,5
7223,and it's one connected to the rest of the mcu with the most satisfying final battle,5
7224,ever since samuel l jackson appeared at the end of iron man 2 thor's hammer in the middle of the action and never stops,5
7225,with the 18th movie in the marvel cinematic universe the avengers age of ultron comes out,5
