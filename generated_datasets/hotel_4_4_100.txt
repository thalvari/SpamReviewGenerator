the rooms were clean and staff was wonderful. we stayed for one night and this was more than adequate. we were in miles city over a month ago and stayed at the deca for a 4-day visit to seattle. there is an old part of the motel with inside hallway entrances and there is a free shuttle that goes up and down king st. the staff was very helpful and the staff were exceptionally helpful. there is a lot to like about this hotel the location i a just across from the new hotels. the room was great and the hotel was quiet with few guests while we were there. comfy beds and pillows clean linens well-stocked breakfast area only complaint was the pull out sofa mattress was not very comfortable. it's a nice hotel the staff is rude and rooms are dirty. the location was fine if you don't like dogs don't stay here. a lamp in the common area is nice and the pool was down. the meet was downtown but i really didn't want to risk it. the pillows are very small and hard as a rock and staying there 2 days really upset my back. yes the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but i will book again next time check suite out before unpacking. they also have an indoor swimming pool hot tub and. this made it a little noisy during the day but it did not hinder us moving about the hotel. not far from all of the staff were fluent in english. the only negative was are room was by trash area but i think it may have been a pull out sleeper. we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with our room when we checked in. i was very firm so much that i couldn't because i was not 21. everything was great will be better when the pool area it's free and you don't like dogs don't stay here. i hope they fix up a few things to caution you of the continental breakfast is a nice touch after a long day. perhaps it's an east-coast thing but i have a sleep number at home so i am spoiled by. our room was large and comfortable but there were some right next door to us. we complained about the wifi and a couple of other visits to columbus. make sure to take the trombetta express train right outside the hotel and universal is an easy walk. the rooms are very nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful. the room was clean and we had a good time there and a good experience there. the property is starting to show its age. i would stay there again if i had the need. there were sugar ants in the bathroom other than that room was clean overall. the casino is next door along with restaurants as well as chil for lunch was very good and much appreciated each morning. would definitely consider staying here again if needed to be in the middle of the night. i would recommend anyone traveling through to stay here and always satisfied with the friendliness of the staff. i'd stay again but try and get a room with 2 twin beds with shared bathrrom for about 150. the room was very spacious and had a great patio with view of the river and mountains. ana on the front desk were super friendly and helpful the complimentary breakfast was very good. convenient but not comfy the beds at this hotel are very comfortable rooms have good amount of space with adequate hanging draws and tables. i was very surprised how nice big the room was when i arrived. good place to stay if you can afford it and want to walk to sf's main attractions then not so good. however after having dominos delivered to me i was told by the front desk clerk was helpful with getting us dinner information. the hotel currently in process of renovating but it wasn't filthy like some other super 8 locations i've frequented. day time office staff was not very friendly felt as if i was bugging them no hot tub as pictured on hotels. so this best western in sunnyvale was about 20 minutes away easy to find and was quite lovely especially the spa. the staff was helpful and friendly and check in was at 3. my hotel room was very nice and peaceful. the only drawback was that our room was quite musty when we arrived. stayed here last year this year and we will continue to repeat our business's there. this hotel is very well situated 3 minutes from a metro stop which was very nice. a couple things weren't quite working tv remote did not work and he was quick to get us a replacement. the hotel is clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced. however i was disappointed by the fact the indoor pool was not available otherwise it would be a great place for the price. they had coffee and rolls in the lobby at the happy hour and a half after check in. great location and staff were very friendly and helpful. the food was really good the location is good and convenient to rides and places of interest. we stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed every bit. we traveled on a sunday so we were able to use the hotel and parking for our 7 day mexican cruise. we have stayed here several times and it has all the amenities for a comfortable night on the road. if you bring a pet your room will not be nearly as nice as the big name hotels in the area and walk around. the restaurant was also busy and the service was very good and clean and well maintained. i guess im saying johnson city is the place to stay while on a long trip and needed someplace to sleep for the night. i stay at this hotel again when i visit atl. room was a little chilly and i had to do it all over again with a new attendant. upon arrival it was an easy check in and super friendly staff. staff was friendly and the hotel was clean and comfortable and the stay was very nice and helpful great customer service. was a little loud for the light sleepers and thermostat took a couple hours to cool down in that south georgia heat. great help and excellent advice on surroundings very nice person at the desk it took about 45 minutes to check in. we stayed there for our soccer tournament weekend would have to go to the pool but it looked nice. we've stayed here before and the rooms are delightful. the room was very clean and comfortable with a good breakfast and fresh coffee. it was ok they over booked so we had to use the noisy a c to sleep. i will definitely stay here when we're in the area. we stayed in a corner room with a king size bed but were moved to a room with a hot tub. reception was small but the staff was very friendly and the warm cookies were a very nice touch. hash browns would have been a good stay. used a suite to get ready and stayed the night to celebrate with friends. didn't use the pool it was just too cool outside but i took advantage of the central courtyard which was pleasant. the motel doesn't allow regular pets which is one of the best accomodations we had during our holiday in florida. this was the case both at check in and the location of the hotel and the gym across the way didn't do day passes. it's right across from the train station this small hotel was perfect for a stay over for the game at fedex field. not over the top amazing but i think i got what i paid for. the only thing that was wrong with our room and the jetted bathtub was amazing. overall good value for money and i would stay there again when i am in the area again. my wife and i stayed here on our recent trip to glacier national park. we also brought our dog who was with us during the day when the people next door had their tv on loud. this is an older hotel that has been updated as needed. the hotel looks 70's-ish on the outside but it is in a industrial area and blends in with office buildings around it. i didnt see any juices but they did have biscuits and gravy with sausage pattys. the bed was big and comfortable and i was able to have a roll away bed could not be used in the room decor. price seemed a little high for this hotel. i'm sure the restaurant in the lobby that we could have a date night with some good dinning shopping and activities. the portions are generous and the food is of a high standard. and you don't like quiet clean and pleasant to the eye and ears. service and cleanliness good but the room was quite comfortable and the refrigerator and microwave are really appreciated. this was a very good deal via hotels. i really enjoyed staying at this hotel we've stayed at the hyatt place. and room seemed just a little bit that was off. by then i was in a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the hotel. otherwise the site is well maintained and the bed was comfortable. hotel is very well located in a beautiful area and very pretty surroundings
