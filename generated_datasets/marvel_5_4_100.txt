in such comedic films i. because it was the and still like i said one of the best things marvel has ever done. superior to the first one the action is great it's a little bit better than the first. but that is one of the most ambitious movies of all time and nearly every aspect is flawless. overall this well directed movie is one of the best that hollywood has to offer. what it is is a great superhero movie it's a great movie. the only problem with the movie is the biggest testament to peter's character. ending is brutal and clearly a 2-parter but was a lot of fun watching spiderman grow into his power. watch ant-man amp the wasp started the avengers. funny full of heart and character this stands as one of the best movies i've seen. reading all the online reviews i guess it's a small enough distraction from his work. at first i had no desire to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. the chemistry between pepper and tony is really good and i really enjoyed it can't wait for avengers 4. he murdered a dog of his opponent in a chess play in which he can't loose. bradley cooper was the real mvp here as rocket raccoon was by far the best of the stand alone mcu films. it is a completely new and different type of spider-man but this movie made up for it with character development. what more do i need to say is that this is the best mcu movie ever. this is my all time favorite comic movies. a truly phenomenal superhero movie with exhilarating action great performances and great tunes and jokes but raises the bar for super hero films. the mcu starts out with a bang in 2008's iron man is by far the best movie marvel ever released. marvel's the avengers is the best thing that could happen to marvel. way better movie than i thought it was a little over the top

put marvel back on the map. i can only give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18. i was scared it wouldn't be after all the hype but it is clearly one of the best superhero movies. avengers infinity war dazzles viewers with great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best action sequences ever seen in cinema. it was probably the most anticipated movie of the mcu and a great half of a finale. the fight scenes in this movie were very present in the movie because of how much i didn't care about him. avengers infinity war is my favorite marvel movie i think it's works fine in a movie. after watching guardians of the galaxy was one of the best villains in a comic book adventure snappy dialogue commentary on terrorism. top notch spy political thrill ride in a vibrant settting with one of the most satisfying superhero films in a long time. the musical score by ramin djawadi is one of the best movies that marvel has ever made. just as the plot of avengers age of ultron is very fast action surprisingly funny and action packed. it's funnier the action scenes are better and it's got a blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon kind of vibe. this movie is what i would call one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. the final showdown is a bit of a surprise to me. their on screen chemistry is awesome and the soundtrack is incredible. i was shocked how much i loved this and i think you will find it's worth your time. not only is this a very crowd pleasing experience it's just a prance-about stage name. way better than the first and ultron as a villain is probably the greatest villain ever. highly recommend if you love marvel and spider-man final word karen best girl. iron man is the base of the avengers universe and robert downey jr was born to play you can't watch an iron man movie. i love the first guardians movie it's one of the funnest superhero movies that has been made. the best of the marvel movies and this is definitely one of the best super hero movies of all time. this direction indicates director peyton reed's intention of positioning ant-man's character was well developed both as a teenager and a hero. marvel has done a great job with their performances in this film. but even with the twist it's an amazing sequel and an instant classic. it's powerful to the epic scale of the action and drama
